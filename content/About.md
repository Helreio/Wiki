I tried writing paragraphs about myself, but it always ends up sounding too dry or flowery, which aside from being terrible bread-making advice, is not really a good look for an About page. So here are some dot points:

- My name, Jahin, rhymes with "the bin".
- I live somewhere in Sydney, NSW ([GeoHack](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Sydney,_Nova_Scotia&params=46_08_11_N_60_11_44_W_region:CA-NS_type:city(30960))).
- I'm currently a full-time student, working on a Bachelor's in IT (effectively CompSci-Lite).
- When I'm not studying, I am:
	- writing small scripts for stuff, mainly in Python and Bash – find them on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jahinzee), or
	- doing graphics design – some of my work can be found [[Graphics|here]].
- I know enough Java, Scala, C and JavaScript to bootstrap myself into more if you held a gun to my head[^1].
- I enjoy going to hackathons, with my most recent being GovHack 2023, where our team's projects won state-level and national awards.
	- The main project I focused on was [a system for assigning livability scores for postcodes](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-elit3/habitasis).
- I'm a big fan of Free and Open Source and [Local-First](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) software.
- I like to take [[Photos|photos]] when I'm out and about, although I very much consider myself a hobbyist in photography.
- I love trainspotting and public transportation in general.
