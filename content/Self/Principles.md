Don’t have a cohesive picture yet, but wanted to write down some things that resonate with me.
This document will likely change over time as I change my mind about things.

- Turning ideas into action.
	- Robotics!
	
- The best way to learn something is to take action and struggling with it. Don’t just think about doing it.
	- Currently, I like daydreaming too much about achieving things but not actually working on them. This doesn’t work because hard work is required to turn my aspirations into reality.

- Don’t need to make something too complicated.

- Time in the market beats timing the market.
	- Applies to stock and gaining experience doing stuff.
	
- Be like a duck. Above the surface, composed and unruffled. Below the surface, paddle like hell.
