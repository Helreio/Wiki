title: Database Prefabs

Basically what we're doing is setting up a set of prefabs for the databases we'll be using with Unity. Items and their assets will be received from LootLocker.
Currently, I'm displaying the items in a Scroll View. This is causing some problems with the prefabs as the Text (I'm using TextMeshPro exclusively while I work on this scene as it's proven to work with the scripting I've been doing) is consistently behind the image prefab:

I'm going to focus on getting more adept with TextMeshPro for the scenes (including content items) and also with displaying/rendering items in an inventory. Maybe we can use GameCreator for this...point is I'm just going to focus on getting those items represented, and then moving to a player market.
