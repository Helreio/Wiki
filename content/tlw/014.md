Lolo Aldo lived in his house near the fishponds he once owned, which now belongs to Tiyo Jessie, his son, who lived with him, and watched over him while he lay down in bed every day. When we reached their humble house that afternoon, Tiyo Jessie was having an early drinking matchup with a friend. Was it lambanog? I am not sure. There was a dog tied on a post outside the house, which we made sure to avoid. The animal was quiet, but Tiyo Jessie said it has already bitten several people.

There was a bunch of us, most from Calamba—Lea’s family and Tita Joy. Everyone went to see Lolo Aldo but not everyone stayed long inside his room. I stayed because Lolo Aldo was a fellow Pangasinense, and Lea’s mom thought it would be nice for the old man to speak with someone who spoke his mother tongue again. I understood why most of them didn’t stay. Urine stench filled Lolo Aldo's room—that stench that said, “I am losing control. And there is nothing I can do about it.” The opened windows, somehow, lessened the smell.

Since the old man can no longer talk audibly, I had to come near him. “Taga iner kayod Pangasinan? (From where are you in Pangasinan?)” I asked him. “Maasin,” he said, referring to one of the barangays of Mangaldan. About a month after this encounter, I would find a map of Mangaldan and see that Maasin was once a railroad barangay, something I find interesting because San Jose, where Lolo Aldo lived in Lopez,  is also a railroad barangay. The train that passed by Maasin passed by San Jose. This triggered thoughts of a young Aldo hopping on the train that would bring him to Lopez, where love awaits him.  

We talked a lot about many things but two things struck me. Lea’s mom asked him what food he wanted to eat. He didn’t seem to care. What went in his mouth didn’t seem to matter anymore. He reached the point where the taste of food is irrelevant. He was in his 90s. His daughter said to us that he can no longer eat much solid food. Soup on rice was usually enough. When asked what food he wanted, he didn’t answer. He stayed silent for a while. And then he uttered the words I will never forget. “It’s near. The end is near for me. But thank you so much for remembering me. For visiting.” He then said he was tired and wanted to lie down. We helped him get back to his pillow and we all left the room.

Three months later, I heard that some people visited Lolo Aldo once more. He was no longer in his room. And the stench of urine was no longer in the air.
