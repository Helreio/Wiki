Jing days - each Jing day is 1+n solar days, where each day is just one more solar day longer than the past

Real Day: 10 (maybe?)

Rumor: There are worse places to die than in the Temple of Jing

Toad sticker - Jing spear
+3 long spear - cure light wounds, bear strength, 1x/day

We pulled levers and they opened doors to other levers and a secret triangle room appeared

Found a room that has scroll tubes and each tube has one of our names on it
Sylvia's has instructions for use on the inside of the case (Jing's Scroll Cases)
Each one only works for the person it's assigned to, no one can read anyone else's scroll even with Read Magic
They have a random spell from any class and the person assigned that scroll to can cast it whether or not they know it, no chance of failure
When cast, the scroll will regenerate after 1 solar day, each Jing day it's a new spell

Forest got [Cat's Grace]()
I got [Magic Circle against Chaos]() - 10 foot radius, 10 mins per level (50 mins)
Alicia got [Burrow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/burrow/)

Found a short door that Sylvia kicked in

Alicia sat on a chair with a gem worth about 500gp

Sylvia looted about 30gp worth of reagents/scroll "ingredients"

Alicia found 6 chits and a piece of paper that says invite to [Xorn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17066-xorn) poker game
we probably won't go to Xorn Poker Night

Found a library room with ghostly books, they're illusory books that read as actual books, they're semisolid, almost phantasmal magic, can be handled and read normally
Plenty of books on many subjects, including specific classes, primarily geared towards a few classes

Can't take the spectral books too far away from the library

Sylvia opens a wooden door in the corner, finds bedroom that is opulent
Room belongs to "Torcath"
Sylvia finds something underneath the mattress "The Manual of Puissant Skills You Don't Know" - artifact book can only be read by characters level 5 or higher

Book takes a solar day to read, only one person can read the book at a time, anyone who spends the time gains a random level of a class we don't have

Should come back to the room to steal the painting

Go into next room and it has table and chairs, and tiny table and chairs, racks for things, and a sign that says "no weapons in the library"

When Sylvia and Aoife come back into the room, Sylvia gets hit with a phantasmal rust monster and it's like NO WEAPONS IN THE LIBRARY but Aoife doesn't see it

oh my fuckin god Sylvia pulls a mattress through a doorway, it's a super comfy fuckin mattress and she got a nat 20 and still got hit by rust monster again

Aoife took the painting and we sold it for 300 gold

The chits are for the music box, can use them instead of gold for the music box, 1 chit per minute of music

Sylvia is buying a "Wand of Shrink Mattress"
incredible
cost 750 gold and super worth it

and she mended her lingerie omg my god +5 Charisma but cannot be worn with armor

Found a room painted like a desert

Found a door with an S on it - the S room means something different and these are rooms where we each get our own version of the room

We are each in the middle of a battle in the desert, they have laser crossbows, strange alien creatures that walk on legs that look like arms, like balls of light that have arms and legarms

Sylvia's room - one of the creatures is blown up, lands at her feet dropping a crossbow. She picks it up

Aoife's room - Explosion hit near me, I acrobatics'd out of the way

Lyric's room - Not much

We all come back and Sylvia has a crossbow that shoots light. She just got a laser gun. Lyric gets the laser gun. Wowie

Next door has yellow mold, Lyric got poisoned

Sylvia drew an x on the door, then wrote the word "mushrooms", then crossed that out and wrote the word mold, Aoife drew a skull and crossbones

Next door, it's like a quiet room, sound isn't silenced but it's pretty muted in here. We can hear whispers
We all hear our own true names out loud for everyone to hear in True Speech (a language everyone can understand) but not necessarily comprehend

I'm basically fine, Sylvia was a little afraid but otherwise unharmed, Lyric was called with a disjointed name because he's 1/7th of himself, and gets sickened for about a minute. Would take True Speech or word magic to figure it out, but since we've heard it we could theoretically learn it again.

Also found the Hall of Pickles - recipes and uses for pickles. Homage to the humble pickle

Found a chest - 300gp, small idol of Jing, a circlet of thorns

We found an enemy called a [totenmaske](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/totenmaske/)
It tried to bite me so I blocked and swept its leg, causing it to fall. Was able to attack but it's an intelligent target.

we killed it

+1067 xp

I use a lesser restoration to fix the charisma loss and Lyric heals Sylvia the rest of the way
