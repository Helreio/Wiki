Liar:
- Something ended up cursed
Paladin:
- Holy Avenger

Lyric got 1/7th of him put into a crystal

Lyric also got us another Opulent Mattress and a pillow for Sylvia and Aoife each

We keep exploring other doors and Lyric fucked up and ruined his lockpicks

Found a dead half-orc with many loot

End up finding an ankylosaur

Sylvia gets clubbed in the head by the dino lol, Aoife hits but the dino hits Sylvia again

Lyric moves to throw the dust of sneezing and choking by throwing it through a doorway, and succeeds, while everyone else was clenched af about the results. The dinosaur isn't incapacitated but it is super stunned.

After rounds and rounds of not hitting things, Aoife dispelled the dinosaur

Much damage to an iron door but the door had nothing behind it

Some of these portal doors led to other doors

We find slot machines! Lyric got misfortune 2x, got a sad rainstorm and got shrunken down to small size

"That's the cost of gambling - sometimes you just get small and wet"

Fought clay golem - 3000 xp each
Dino was 800 each

Found the room of keys, grabbed 4x gold, 1 silver, 1 bone, and then a bunch more keys we all got individually

Found gargoyle room

"My other ears are already in those holes!"

Aoife laughs at Lyric's dumb donkey ears but then Lyric releases a swarm of paper spiders on her and it hits Sylvia too

Aoife calls him a jackass and nearly got in a new fight again
