#### Wolf

The aspect of the wolf provides the senses and the attacks of the mighty wolf, whose instincts are honed to track and take down its prey.

**Minor Form**: You gain the [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-) ability with a range of 10 feet, or, if you have the [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-) ability, the range increases by 10 feet. The range of this [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent) or the increase to your [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent) increases to 20 feet at 8th level and 30 feet at 15th level. The range doubles if the opponent is upwind and is halved if the opponent is downwind.

**Major Form**: Your shape changes to that of a [dire wolf](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/canines/wolf/dire-wolf/). While in this form, you gain a base speed of 50 feet, [low-light vision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Low-Light-Vision), and [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent) (30 feet), a bite (1d8 damage), and you can make a [trip](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip) attempt with your bite attack. At 8th level, the range of your [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-) ability increases to 40 feet and you gain a +4 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) on [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival) checks when tracking with [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent). At 15th level, you gain [Improved Natural Attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/improved-natural-attack) (bite).
#### Shifter Claws (Su)

At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions) to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter’s faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary [natural attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks), dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary [natural attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks) instead.

As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases.
#### Wild Empathy (Ex)

A shifter can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a [Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy) check to improve the attitude of a person. The shifter rolls 1d20 and adds her shifter level and [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier to determine the [wild empathy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Wild-Empathy-Ex-) check result. The typical domestic [animal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild [animals](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) are usually unfriendly.

To use [wild empathy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Shifter/#TOC-Wild-Empathy-Ex-), the shifter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another and under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

The shifter can also use this ability to influence a [magical beast](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast) with an [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.
