We have left the HalloJing behind us

We enter a room with 3 letters and 3 statues, in the room across from us is a 50-foot wide cyclone that is "only" 20 feet tall

We each get a scroll, Lyric gets Greater Zeroism level 5
Sylvia gets Fiberball level 3
I got level 7... Limited Fish
Anyone fishing in the area of effect can only catch 1 small fish per day

These are... The Statues of Silly Scrolls

A cow comes into the room and walks into the cyclone, it gets lifted up and at the top we hear what seems to be the sound of a cow getting blenderized.

We do run up the cylinder as the tornado comes up (hasted) but there was a hallway we dashed into that had a smiley face made of rocks

The smiley face was a ruse planted by rhinoceraptors! they try to launch us into the hallway but Sylvia holds the line

Some fighting happens, then a Rhinoceraptor fucks up a roll and yeets itself to the bottom of the cyclone floor

We win lol

Go up another level and we are ambushed by like 6 more Rhinoceraptors

Aoife gets gored and takes an Int damage (which is fixable) and then gets her ass officially handed to her

Hoo boy we are doing ok, we make a corridor of web and solid fog to lock the rhinoceroses into not being able to circle around us and this works extremely well

We get to a point where we can't kill them anymore because the body pile is too tall for us to hit them

We whittle down the rhinoceraptors and Aoife does a lesser restoration to fix her int damage

Aoife takes all the damage again but is ok

Lyric uses many charges in a wand to fix her back to nearly full

We chop off horns to sell for later

Flanders speaks Celestial

We get to each ask a question, Aoife asks in Elven if Sylvia could be into her, the wall says yes

Lyric knows all of Aoife's languages so she can't have secrets anymore

And then more rhinoceraptors

And we find a room with horns all over the wall! One is a lever to the rhinoceraptor loot room

We keep going up to the final floor

If you wish to leave this area you have 3 choices: search for another exit the way we came, easy path through the door to my right, hard path riddle - failure casts into the cyclone pit

So we took the easy way out which was a slide to the bottom of the cyclone room

The answer to the riddle is "Spell" and we unlock the door to yet another fight

We get through and there's a FREAKING DRUID guy who's mad that we murdilated its babies and he summoned a whirlwind

Tough fight but we prevail, Sylvia got yote by the whirlwind but we made it, I sacrificed my fishing scroll to pass.
