We got some warped Jing time and some levels

+2 dex silver key
Each of the gold keys - +3 to HP, 12 temporary health

We all get on this merry-go-round in HalloJing and Aoife is first to be flung from the ride

Lyric threw up but it didn't hit Aoife and then he was flung from the ride also

Sylvia won a giant stuffed manticore but then traded it for a kid's chupacabra since she cost the kid his throw

Aoife did a strength test and then got an inflatable hammer that does a D4 nonlethal damage, it's magical and it goes squeaky

Sylvia also got the hammer

This scale goes from flaccid => limp biscuit => wet noodle => grandma => few more ranks => ROCK HARD

Lyric did throwing knives at zombie balloons and won a zombie panda

Aoife did a shooting challenge and got a small vampire badger

Sylvia finds a mechanical golden bull and gets her butt kicked

Lyric gets on a gravitron called The Splatter Zone and vomits immediately and then everyone else does. 7 people got on that right but 8 got off

Sylvia gets 2 deep fried Snickers and gives one to Aoife

Aoife loves deep fried everything

Didn't like the churro

Loves slushy 1 less than deep fry

When it starts it is Aoife, Sylvia, The Predator, Xenomorph, Chucky, and Slenderman vs a bunch of randos from Betrayal at House on the Hill and also Lyric

Sylvia won!

Then we did a drinking contest, had to go 10 rounds, Aoife made 8 saves and Sylvia made 9

# Solar Day 12

We are passed out and Lyric brings us back to the tent with a horse, and we wake up very close together, both nauseated

Aoife does a mercy heal to fix both our nauseated

Lyric cleans up the dicks he drew on our faces

Then Sylvia and Aoife are very cute in the morning together
