Tiffany Winters thought herself a fairly capable woman. She had her own place, paid all her own bills, and could even kick an ass or two, when that was warranted, of course. She liked to have a good time, too.

Which is why she was incredibly confused when a strange man approached her one day and informed her she was "destined" or something to "kill vampires".

"Kill vampires," she muttered, walking through the streets with her groceries, "he told me to kill vampires."

She noticed a few people staring, probably looking to avoid the crazy girl muttering about the vampires. "Gonna think I'm as crazy as *Crazy John* is..."

She looked up, noticing the rapidly setting sun, and the errant thought *better get inside before sunset* crossed her mind unwittingly. She chuckled, then re-tightened her grip on her bags of food and continued homeward.

About three blocks before she got home, who did she run into except an old friend!

"Tiffany!" her old partner-in-crime Alex yelled from across the court, "Hey Tiff!"

She rushed over to give an awkward hug, "Alex, I haven't seen you in years, how have you been?"
