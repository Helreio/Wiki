"welcome to the nexus of doors! Here you'll find many magical doors that will block your way, there's a key for every locked door in the temple. Also super doors. Finally there's a door playing hide and seek, this door lets you go anywhere in the level"

Riddle: When is a door not a door? When it's a jar lol

We went to go find new rooms, Sylvia tries to trick Aoife into kicking open the bottom

Lyric can't lockpick an iron door immediately, but he gets there eventually

Found a wooden door. Aoife failed a save and was compelled to prevent anyone from going through the door. It was hilarious but Lyric made a save and got by the door.

Found a door that locks behind you, only Lyric made it through. Sylvia is gonna try to fuck up this door since we cannot lockpick our way through lol. Sylvia chops up the door instead.

Sylvia finds a lever, we hear a *ka-chunk*, and the lever comes back up. The damaged door respawns. It's like all new doors, now this one is "double-locked". Iron door, now it'll be super hard to get through. And then Sylvia pulls the lever over and over and we reset the door until we get a curtain.

The curtain had [Symbol of Pain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/symbol-of-pain/) and we decided to pull out the bed and take an hour rest so we can avoid -4 on most things
