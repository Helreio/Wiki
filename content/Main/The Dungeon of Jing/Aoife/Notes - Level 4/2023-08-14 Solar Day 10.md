Forest rolled an encounter, got a 5 on the fortune and 1 on the misfortune

Cleric comes in and accuses Sylvia of being a demon, which... well... and then he flame strikes us and we are RIGHT ON OUR BEAUTIFUL BED AND PILLOW

Opulent mattress and masterwork scented pillow are gone :(

And someone popped out of the shadow on the wall to stab Lyric, giving him a sucking chest wound

Aoife was able to slash the cleric and Sylvia, enraged, goes after the shadow man

Lyric makes mirror images of himself to help out

The braggart Sven Silverman is like "let me show you my skills" and Aoife blocks it deftly, though he does almost hit

Shadowman is attacking Sylvia, hits once and misses the second

Aoife and Sven are fairly evenly matched

Lyric is able to pin Shadowman's shadow to the ground, and Sylvia does not just go psycho and attack

Aoife and Sven are engaged in Perfectly Symmetrical Violence

Lyric and Sylvia have identified that this other person is a shadowmancer and is summoning backup shadows to fuck up their day

Sylvia attempts to grapple the shadowmancer Quill and misses with a nat 1 again

Aoife and Sven are engaged in Perfectly Symmetrical Violence

Quill attacked shadow lightning on Aoife and then she used her teleport to attack him

Lyric shot the gun at Sven, he missed but lol

Sylvia goes for the attack, gets a crit threat woo hoo

Aoife was able to get a crit threat on Quill but not a crit hit

Lyric used the gun on the cleric, did 9 damage

Wow Sylvia gets a gore on a Nat 20

Sylvia was successfully able to kill Quill (with Sven's help lol)

Aoife heals Sylvia a bunch and then Sylvia is mad at Sven

"To hell with your god's judgment - I'm just pissed about the scented pillow!!!!!"

Sven tanks Sylvia's attack with a very good block

Aoife moves to flank Sven but misses

Sven brags and says demons are almost as bad as lycanthropes

Sylvia grapples Sven successfully and does a grapple claw attack

And she goes all in on attacking, "GIVE ME BACK MY GOD DAMN PILLOW, CAN YOUR GOD DO THAT?????"

Anyway we kill them, loot them and we rest
