We are in a room with ten pillars and a statue of Jing (not a Jing Statue) and the pedestal has four doors, each locked and made of marble

Lyric keeps failing to unlock the doors properly so we keep fighting monsters that spawn from the pedestals, first a fiendish dire bat and then a big gorilla

Aoife oneshot the bat and then helped destroy the gorilla, next one is a vrock

"I don't have enough hands to lay on this hole"

Vrock is kicking butt but we are also kicking butt even more

Aoife destroys the hell out of the Vrock but we are still spored

The spores last 10 rounds and can be cleaned up by bless or holy water

Ring of Protection is now a Ring of Climbing too

We keep going and Alicia accidentally opens the door and two Xorn are there, they demand gems so Lyric throws wasps, they made their saves against wasp poison but they took 7 points of damage.

Oh but Lyric didn't realize the wasps last 9 minutes. They bite us regardless.

Aoife gets enlarged again and then we kill the Xorn

We find a black door with a skull inlaid, we use the bone key, which is good because this door has Symbol of Death on it

We found bodaks - DR 10 cold iron, immune electricity, resist acid and fire, vulnerable to sunlight. They r mean

We won

Sylvia runs through a paper door and it turns to wall of force but we have magic shovel

Sylvia mines for 30 minutes and Aoife stares and Sylvia fails the roll while Aoife is drooling

Found 3 silver doors to steal and sell, went back to the gold doors and opened 3/4 of them

We hack through an iron door in, revealing a room containing a single treasure pile, with a LOT of money

When Sylvia feels the floor she disappears so we just boop away with her.

We appear in a room with a Jing statue

"Beyond here lies the Trial of Choice. Rest here while you still can."
