## Housekeeping
I'm going to start tracking lists of changes that happen during the previous month! This should provide a nice little bump to the RSS feed since I edit pages post-creation a lot.

There'll also be a small blog component to it.
- Law school is back in full swing! I'm juggling a lot of computer projects as well as coursework, so this site might slow a bit.
- I did a vegan cheese party with some friends (they're vegan, not me) and made a cheese platter, margherita pizza, and some fried mozz sticks. Here's the result:

## New Pages
- I fiddled with the [[index|homepage]] a bit.
- I added comments with Remark42, and documented it [[Projects/Obsidian/quartz-comments|here]].
- I started fleshing out [[Projects/my-computer|My Computer]].
- I'm researching and angling towards fully writing through the essay on [[Essays/why-i-garden|Why I Garden]].
## Status Updates
- I finally got around to looking into Mastodon and the Fediverse more broadly. The ideas are *insanely* cool. Expect pages and maybe projects on it in future.
