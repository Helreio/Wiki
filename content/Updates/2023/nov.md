## Housekeeping
It's birthday month! My hosting service is surprising me with random shutoffs for "inactivity", despite the fact that this webpage serves so much bot traffic (all blocked, of course) and I have about seven other microservices being called from the same webserver.

## Pages
- Added a reference to how I block bots on this website: [[Projects/Obsidian/digital-garden|Digital Garden]]
- Updated [[Projects/Obsidian/quartz-comments|Remark42 Comments]], check [[#Status Updates]] for more info
## Status Updates
- Finally created a Mastodon account! [@be_far@treehouse.systems](https://social.treehouse.systems/@be_far), go follow me.
- Got email working for comments!! Go check it out and use the fancy new sign in.
