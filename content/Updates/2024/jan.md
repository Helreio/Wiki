## Housekeeping
I feel like I finally have a handle on the feel of this site. Front page looks very polished now, and I got around to drawing a great-looking and really symbolic logo:

It's a moon due to my goals for the site and digital gardening as a whole, and progressively more detailed to reflect the incremental, learn-in-public philosophy of gardening. Hopefully that second meaning is apparent by the 1/2 in the middle of it.
## Pages
- Published [[Essays/law-school|Law School is Broken]]!
- Getting a little sick of seeing arguments across the internet advocating for plagiarism and not citing your sources. Here's [[Essays/plagiarism|my response to plagiarists]].
- Added my [[bookmarks|public bookmarks]] in the spirit of digital gardening.
- Cleaned up [[Essays/why-i-garden|Why I Garden]] a little bit.
## Status Updates
- Updated the theme a little bit to be easier on the eyes.
- Added a **beautiful** new index page
