## Honcho v0.0.4

ADDED
- A User object for global user level metadata and more object oriented interface

CHANGED
- Get sessions method returns all sessions including inactive
    
- Using timestampz instead of timestamp
    
- `Client`Â renamed toÂ `Honcho`
    
- `Honcho`Â takes inÂ `app_name`Â instead ofÂ `app_id`.Â `app_name`Â needs to be a unique identifier
