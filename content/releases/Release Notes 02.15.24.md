Today we've got Honcho v0.0.3, vectorDBs, open source OAI memory, demos, and a blog post.
  
If you're building with or adjacent to [Honcho](https://honcho.dev), [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/plasticlabs), and let's jam on what we can build together ü§ù.  

## News
- VectorDB support for global, session-spanning user information!
    
- An open source reimplementation of OpenAI's 'memory' features:
    
	- Uses Honcho to effortlessly organize sessions on a per-user basis
    
	- Derives facts about users, stores them, and retrieves for later use
    
	- [Implementation with the useful abstractions LangChain provides](https://docs.honcho.dev/how-to/personal-memory/simple-user-memory)
	  
	- [Discord Bot demo](https://discord.gg/plasticlabs)!
    
	- [[Memories for All|Blog post on the why]]
