Uman is my monthly newsletter, which features updates about my life and projects.

It is written as a narrativeâ€”a beautiful tapestry of my studies, walks, conversations, etc., that also serves as a cairn. By writing it, I practice long-form writing with both exposition and description.

It is released on the first week of the month, ideally on the sixth or seventh day, to give time for editing and revising.

Here is [[How to prepare an issue of Uman]], and here are all the Uman issues so far:
