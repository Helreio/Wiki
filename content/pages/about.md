My name is David Buchan and if you need to contact me, send a Mastodon message to [@dcbuchan@aus.social](https://@dcbuchan@aus.social).  I'd love to hear from you.

I'm currently working as an IT Strategy Consultant with an interest in how we use technology to hold meaningful and productive conversation.

My downtime is frequently spent on the Playstation with action adventure games such as [[Horizon Forbidden West]], [[Forspoken]], [[Uncharted]] and [[The Last of Us]]. I also paint Warhammer miniatures when I can be bothered setting up a place to paint. Same with my binoculars for astronomy. I would play D&D if I could commit the time.

Recently though I've been getting back into photography and have started uploading images to [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/142019185@N05/).

My reading is mostly science fiction/fantasy and I generally read around 20,000 pages a year on my [[Amazon Kindle]].

I enjoy non-processional car racing which means a thumbs up for GT3, Indycar and of course the [[Bathurst 1000]]. My go-to racing sim games are [[Assetto Corsa Competizione]] and [[Gran Turismo 7]] with a wheel.

I don't much enjoy long walks on the beach.
