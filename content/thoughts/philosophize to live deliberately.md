Of course, at the core of philosophizing is this insatiable desire to know the truth. This is still a very important purpose of philosophy. However, we can get so caught up with this game that we forget a more fundamental reason why we want to know what is trueâ€”to live our own definition of a good life.

The idea is that by being sharp in knowing what is true via [[thoughts/metaphysics]] and [[thoughts/epistemology]], we can understand better the terrain of life and ourselves, which in turn helps us take better [[thoughts/action]]s (see [[Practical application is the ultimate test of knowledge]]).

For example, although, [[The Buddha avoided metaphysics]] because, according to him, it prevents us from being kind to each other (because [[We agree about what we want and disagree about metaphysics and epistemology]]), [[Amoralism]] demonstrates that [[Metaphysics and epistemology can help us be kinder]]. So, if our definition of a good life is a kind life, to [[thoughts/see things as they really are]] through metaphysics and epistemology can help us get there.
