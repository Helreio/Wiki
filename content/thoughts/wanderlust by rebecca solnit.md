After Vincenz Serrano sent me the syllable of his class on walking at Ateneo, I asked him, if I'm going to read just one book on the list of references on walking, which is it? He replied, Rebecca Solnit's A History of Walking.

The ebook has been sitting in my computer for god knows how long so I'm glad I now have a very good reason to start reading it.

In the book, at least where I am right now, Rebecca criticizes Thoreau (who introduced me to walking) along with the entire canon of walking literature. Rebecca argues that the Western walking literature is basically a sausage party that fetishizes rural walking with nature as object. And then she introduces alternative forms of walking, which are less motivated by a desire to romanticize nature and which women have also participated in. One of these forms is urban walking, a "messier" way to walk but one that was not bound to the moralizing tendencies of nature and rural walks.
