Hi, I'm Jahin[^1].

I'm a software programmer, mainly writing Python these days, and a hobbyist graphics designer. My most recent project is a [small app that bothers you on the hour, every hour](https://github.com/jahinzee/benzi).

I'm also a huge hackathon junkie, with my most recent soiree being [GovHack 2023](https://govhack.org/) (the largest one I've ever been to date!), where my team and I had a lot of fun brainstorming and creating ideas.

In my spare time, I enjoy video essays and documentaries, [[Transportation|transportation]], worldbuilding and conlanging, potatoes, and the occasional [[Photos|photography]].

Catch me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.online/@jahinzee), or reach out to me [[Contact|here]] if you have any questions!
