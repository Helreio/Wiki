Welcome to our collaborative second brain. We're a research and development company working at the intersection of human and machine learning.

Our first product was [Bloom](https://bloombot.ai) -- a *subversive learning companion*. On this journey, we realized AI tools need a framework for securely and privately handling the intimate data required to unlock deeply personalized, autonomous agents.  

Itâ€™s our mission to realize this future.
