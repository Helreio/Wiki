Welcome to our collaborative second brain. Here you'll find our blog posts, "Extrusions" newsletter, and evergreen notes. And if you like, [you can engage with the ideas directly](https://github.com/plastic-labs/blog) on GitHub.

Plastic Labs is a research-driven company working at the intersection of human and machine learning. Our current project is [Honcho](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho), a user context management solution for AI-powered applications. We believe that by re-centering LLM app development around the user we can unlock a rich landscape of deeply personalized, autonomous agents.

Itâ€™s our mission to realize this future.
