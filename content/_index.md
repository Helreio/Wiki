Hello there, I'm Jet! I am a undergraduate student at the University of Otago and this is my personal collection of notes, slash my portfolio.

These are very rough, work-in-progress notes. I would not expect them to be very useful to anyone besides myself.

- What I'm doing [now](notes/now.md)
- My [goals](private/goals.md)
- 

1) [Uni Notes](notes/uni-notes.md)
2) [Cheat Sheets](notes/cheat-sheets.md)
3) [Philosophy](notes/philosophy.md)
4) [Media](notes/media.md)
5) [Independent Learning](notes/independent-learning.md)
6) [Personal Development](notes/personal-development.md)
