Hi!

I'm Jahin[^1], a Python programmer, hobbyist [[Portfolio|graphics designer]], and Linux enthusiast based in Sydney.

My bread-and-butter is writing small, over-engineered scripts that do one (most likely pointless) thing, such as [a small app that annoys you; on the hour, every hour](https://github.com/jahinzee/benzi).

I also like attending hackathons, such as [GovHack 2023](https://govhack.org/), where I worked on [a system for assigning liveability scores for postcodes](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-elit3/habitasis), for which we were placed first in the *Cost of Living Pressure NSW* category.

In my spare time, I enjoy video essays and documentaries, transportation, worldbuilding and conlanging, potatoes, and the occasional [[Photos|photography]].

Catch me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.online/@jahinzee), or reach out to me [[Contact|here]] if you have any questions!
