<h1>Hi! I'm Jahin!</h1>

Welcome to my website/digital garden. For now, this serves mainly as an organised tip for my writings, photos, and other miscellaneous stuff.

Here's a somewhat hierarchical layout of where to go from here:

- More information [[About|about me]] - sometimes 
- Long form [[Text|text]] content.
- My rather questionable [[Playlist|music tastes]].
- A [[Graphics|showcase]] of graphics design stuff I've made over the years.
- My [[Photos|photo collection]], all available under Creative Commons.
- Get a hold of me [[Contact|here]] for any questions or anything else.

Before you go, catch me on [Mastodon](http://mastodon.online/@jahinzee) â€“ I usually post things here more frequently.
