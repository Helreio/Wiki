Plastic Labs is a research-driven company working at the intersection of human and machine learning. Our current project is [Honcho](https://honcho.dev), a user context management solution for AI-powered applications. 

We believe that by re-centering LLM app development around the user we can unlock a rich landscape of deeply personalized, autonomous agents.

Itâ€™s our mission to realize this future.
