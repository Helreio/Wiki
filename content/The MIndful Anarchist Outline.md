___

- Conservative practice a perverse form of religion

___

- A lot of people, including vaush here, conflate mysticism with New Age superstition. A lot of the "anti-mystics" out really need to know the term New Age. All the woo woo crystal energy bullshit out their is New Age.
- Mysticism is not faith based but is entirely phenomenological.
- Then define [[mysticism]]
- In Buddhism‚Äîwhich is a mystical tradition‚Äîthe practice of [[insight]] meditation involves seeing into the true nature of things, which is constituted by [[the three characteristics]]. Note the word 'characteristic.' These are adjectives, not nouns. You are to apply these to experience in order to achieve insight, and insight is what culminates into enlightenment (union with the divine) within Buddhism, not faith.
- Nor is all religion the same as conventional Abrahamic religion as vaush seems to believe (it was that vid with the thumbnail of black and white pic of some guy holding up a sign about god)
- Leftists really shouldn't adopt this staunch secular rationalist atheist approach to the world to distinguish themselves from conservatives. It is a highly unsatisfactory worldview. [[Anything that cannot be measured is considered meaningless or nonexistent to science]].
- The rationalist/superstitious duality is a false dichotomy
- Also talk about the secularist appropriation of mysticism and why its wrong. Also about how the aversion to mysticism at this point would be blind prejudice
- Capitalisms uncertainty brings us out of the present
- This leads to conservation of wealth
- Anarchism is a middle way between collectivism and individualism 
- Go into the radical nature of mysticism and how capitalism has tried to co-opt it into a aesthetic and an identity to show off. Also link that to the appropriation of mindfulness
- Private property and it‚Äôs defense is rooted in ignorance. The Buddha shows us we do not own anything. It‚Äôs our belief that things are permanent and satisfying that leads us to defend them from others and become stingy and selfish. Non-clinging promotes empathy, cooperation, and will make people more willing to accept common ownership
- Leftists adopt scientism and rationalism to distinguish themselves from religious conservatives. 
- This is a false dichotomy that is created by the non-awareness of mysticisms existence. This is why I worry about mysticism being conflated with ordinary religion and superstition. Mysticism is the only way out of these two types of thinking. These two fundementalisms.
- rationalism desires mechanistic control and predictability and is opposed to anarchism
- Further substantiate anarchism through psychology and metaphysics

- The primary priciple of this society would be [[Non-forcing]]
- [[Flow]]
- [[Self-organization]]
- [[Along with the instinct for self-preservation, every animal also has an instict to protect the gene-pool]]
- Such a society would act by [[The three wholesome roots]]
- [[Values can only be considered truly valid until one witnesses their value for themselves]]
- Authority figures interfear with this process. People are not able to connect their actions with real world consequences. Thus they never really become disinclined to perform those actions. They only avoid those actions when other people are around
- [[Mindfulness can allow us to get over bad habits without cognitive effort]]
- [[Many doctrines expound ideas which require a degree of trust and insist upon our faith in them]]
- [[No doctrine can be considered true until it has been validated through ones own personal experience]]
- [[The results of an action can disincentivize us to perform that action in the future]]
- [[Natural consequences]]
- [[Natural consequences allow people to make associations between actions and their inherent consequences]]
- [[Illogical consequences]]
- [[Meditators have been shown to be able to uncouple negative emotional reactions from their behavior]]
- [[Mindfulness can help see through our baises toward selfish tendencies and increase empathy]]
