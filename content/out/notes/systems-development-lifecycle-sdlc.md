#### Review Questions

1. How can business process re-engineering be used in the analysis phase and what benefits can it provide? 
bpr can be used in the analysis phase to simplify the processes relevant to the project. The benefits it provides include: SImpler requirements, better understanding of domain

# SDLC
Provides overall framework for managing the systems
There are many methodologies to help guide us through this cycle
Each methodology sits on the [Predictive adaptive spectrum](out/notes/predictive-adaptive-spectrum.md)
A very common methodology at the moment is [Agile Development](out/notes/agile-development.md)

## Phases
### Analysis 
^2d7976
- Lots of communication with [Stakeholders](out/notes/stakeholders.md) 
- Gather detailed information
- define system requirements
- prioritise requirements (what is risky, what brings value to business) -> increase proability of success
- develop UI dialogs ([Prototyping](out/notes/prototyping.md) where the user can interact with the system)
- evaluate requirments
- review reccomendations with management

## Business process re-engineering
method of organising company
- streamline processes to be efficient and efffective
- question basic assumptions

use ICT to help with BPR 

sys analyst may find opportunites to improve processes
- any project can include components of BPR

simpler business processes -> simpler requirements -> simpler system

## Requirements
- [Requirements](out/notes/requirements.md)
- [Requirements elicitation](out/notes/requirements-elicitation.md)
- Something the system should do 
- Some constraint the system should have
- Can be functional or non functional
- Good requirements prevent failure

## SDLC Variations
- different terminology
- change focus on people
- change speed of development
	- [Prototyping](out/notes/prototyping.md)
	- Rapid application development (RAD)

## Failure
main goal: Avoid project failure
- complete fail implies nothing delivered
- Types of fail
	- cost overruns
	- sw quality issues
	- missed deadlines
	- unhappy [stakeholders](out/notes/stakeholders.md)

Suprisingly very common with large projects
