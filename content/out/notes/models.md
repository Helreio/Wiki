# Models
> "A model is an informative representation of an object, person or system"

Software is made up of models. It is not only "code"
Models can be high level (mockups etc) or low level (code)
Models can be executable (code, ec) or not (diagrams)

Models are used in [Domain Driven Design](out/notes/domain-driven-design.md) and in  [Behaviour Driven Development](out/notes/behaviour-driven-development.md)
