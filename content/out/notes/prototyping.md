# Review questions
1. what are three traits of a good prototype

2. what insights can be gained from prototyping

3. give a one sentence of prototyping

___
# Prototyping
Quickly creating a minimal, functioning approximate version of an idea, which reveals potential issues(feedback) that may be hard to predict(unknown unknows) otherwise

>"The way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas" - Linus Pauling

> "Prototypes are questions. Ask lots of them"

Rapid Prototyping as [Simulated Annealing](out/notes/simulated-annealing.md)

## Goals
- minimise time spent
- maximise information gained
	- cost of change increases with time
- help [stakeholders](out/notes/stakeholders.md) understand ideas

## Traits of a good prototype:
- not fully complete
- easy to change/create
- retired/evolved quickly

## Insights gained from prototyping
- Feel -> Form
- Implementation -> Function
- Role -> Overall Experience
