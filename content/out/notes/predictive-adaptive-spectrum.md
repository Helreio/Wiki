## Review Questions
1. what is a predictive swd methodology
	1. one that is not flexible, rigid, not incremental, has well defined requirements and is planned in advance
	2. low techincal risk
	
2. what is an adaptive swd methodology
	1. not planned in advance, more flexible, incremental
	2. high technical risk
	
3. what is meant by the waterfall and the modified water fall methodology
	1. waterfall methodology is when there are a set of steps for the development life cycle and each one "flows" into the next with no returnig to previous steps
	
4.  Within an adaptive methodology, what are:
	1. iterations
		- one cycle of the steps
	1. incremental development
		- when projects are completed in a series of interations
	2. walking skeleton
		- when development begins by creating a bare bones (similar to mvp) structure

# Predictive adaptive spectrum

## Predictive
- panned project in advance
- requirements well defined
- low technical risk

#### waterfall
- "water fall" -assumes phases are completed sequentially (no overlap or iteration)
![500](None)
- modified water fall - slightly less rigid verision of "waterfall" which allows some overlap
![500](None)


## Adaptive
- more flexible, changes as you go. cannot be planned in advance
- requirements uncertain
- high techinal risk

e.g., 
![500](None)

#### Iterations
"micro projects"

#### Incremental development
complete projects in small iterations
"growing" a system

#### Walking skeleton
complete structure is built with bare bones functionality
further functionality added iteratively
similar to minimum viable product (MVP)
