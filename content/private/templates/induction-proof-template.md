We will prove that, for every non-negative integer $n$, *insert property here*

For $n = 0$, *The property* is true because *explicit verification of this case*

For any $n > 0$, assuming *the property*  is true for $n-1$ (or, for all $k < n$), *the property* is true at $n$ because *explain why we can take a step up*

Therefore, by induction, *the property* is true for all n.
