In 2022, Dhaka opened its first rapid rail transit line, the MRT Line 6 running from Uttara North to Motijheel. I managed to give it a ride earlier this year when I was visiting family, and I was very impressed - it was clean and reliable, although the whole sticking-a-station-above-a-major-road thing was a bit strange to me.

The data for this map was based on the current Phase 1 plans from the [DMCTL website](http://www.dmtcl.gov.bd/site/page/ccdc49ad-c632-4953-bbce-acfdad3e830d/At-a-Glance-Dhaka-Mass-Transit-Company-Limited). As you might be able to tell, I also took heavy aesthetic inspiration from the [Sydney Trains/Metro map](https://transportnsw.info/document/4746/sydney-rail-network-map-5-jan.pdf). It was a natural choice of influence, since I am a Sydneysider.
