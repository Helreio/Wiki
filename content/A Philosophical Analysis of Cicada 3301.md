## A Philosophical Analysis of Cicada 3301

Subtitle:

- An excursion 
- privacy, security, liberty, and transcendence

_[[Bryce McAlister]]_
_(Date)_

The Cicada 3301 puzzles are one of the Internets greatest mysteries, and has captured the attention of countless lurkers of the web. However, few of the people interested in the Puzzles have seemed to bother reading the literature 3301 had referenced in there puzzles (For those interested in what these references were, you can find them [here](https://uncovering-cicada.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_all_Cicada%27s_references)).

Some solvers proclaim that the philosophical references are nothing more than arbitrary aesthetic themes, beneath which lies a strictly cryptographic puzzle. I personally am far from believing this to be so, and in this article I will attempt to dispel this notion. I believe the references do share a cohesive narrative, and one that also aligns with their self-proclaimed values as stated in their leaked email: "that tyranny and oppression of any kind must end, that censorship is wrong, and that privacy is an inalienable right.”

This is also despite the fact that in their leaked email 3301 personally described _themselves_ as a "think tank ... drawn together by common beliefs. A careful reading of the texts used in the contest would have revealed some of these beliefs." I have decided to embark in such a [[🔮 The Cosmos/The Flow|careful reading]] myself. Out of this reading I will attempt to uncover what these very beliefs may be. I will try to see what kind of overarching narrative I can extract between Cicadas literature references and what they have said themselves. Be aware that this is my own interpretation, and my personal bias's may influence my findings, so take from it what you will. I will also aim to “bring an end to all your struggle and suffering, your innocence, your illusions, your certainty, your reality, and your self” ;). Without further a due, lets begin. 

- I hope to move beyond the current extent of most literature discussion, which generally consists of posting vague, out of context quotations. 
- Or those who feel the need to post any random piece of media which contains some word correlation, i.e., "circumference!""interconnectedness!" without considering its meaning and context, or explaining the potential connection.
- Just because your geometry text book said circumference doesn't mean it's cicada related.
- Just because some TV show mentions "enlightenment"
- I wish to make sense of these seemingly fragmented and unrelated components

### Outline

[[Alt cicada outline]]

#### Organize/Ideas

- I am thinking about moving some of the Age of Unreason stuff toward the beginning and intermixing Living from the Devil with The Simulation. This is because it’s not all about epistemology. Epistemology is only a part of it all
- [[High-temperature search]]
- [[Low-temperature search]]
- [[When solving problems, the left hemisphere tends to rely on a single solution that fits what it already knows]]
    - wouldn’t be surprised if solvers are falling victim to something like this. Staying strictly in the scope of conventional cryptography, avoiding the literature and philosophy, avoiding occult crypto, etc
- the circumference is the ego and the persona. The divinity within in the self archetype and the true will
- Question  6: "You cannot step into the same river twice." If [[The right hemisphere is better at dealing with fluidity and motion, whereas the left is better at dealing with things in stasis]], then its both depending on how you look at it. 
- [[Contracted consciousness]]
- [[Expanded consciousness]]
    - Find the divinity within and _emerge_
    - emerge can also refer to [[High-temperature search]]es in the sense of emerging creatively
- Many people take Enlightenment philosophy to be a way out of magical thinking, but for Adorno and Horhiemer, it's not as different as it seems. 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMVjI3pcwcU 
- what we need to move past is not "magical thinking," but essentialist thinking. Enliightenment is just another form for the same mindset. It only seems different on the surface
- I believe the circumfrence represents the boundries that we set for ourselves both physically and mentally. The first two of the three behaviors are beliefs. The I within the koan is also a boundry. To shed the circumfrence is to shed all boundries
- the Koan may indicate an abandoning of our associations and views of who we fundamentally are.
	- the koan refers to our letting go of our social roles
	- When we shed our perceived boundaries, we no longer feel trapped within this so called self. We feel a sense of expansion. We feel unified with the totality of things.
- [[The left hemisphere deals with conscious explicit linear reasoning, and the right with implicit unconscious deductive reasoning]]
- [[The right hemisphere plays a large role in deductive reasoning]]
- "Crowley's tripartite explanation places us directly in the Age of Horus which would explain the lost generation, the sixties, and the age of cybernetic digital utopias."
- Consumption = [[Craving]]
- Preservation = [[Clinging]]
- [[Jump out of the system]]
	- we cannot fail to see the revolutionary connotations here
- Solvers Nox and Tweaqx report that the Wisdom and Folly files were thought by solvers at the time to be In reference to a discussion in the irc about the difference between folly and wisdom in Crowleys work, and that by making the contents of the files identical, it was meant to signify that there was no difference between wisdom and folly.

### The Simulation

- alt name: the matrix, symbolizing the mother archetype, matter, etc

![[10E13D35-7449-4669-8317-654739FBDC70.png]]

##### Organize

- [[The right hemisphere has a more loose orginazational structure than the left hemisphere]]
- [[Distinct brain networks are able to communicate and connect more openly when the default mode network is inactive]]
- [[The right hemisphere is better at dealing with fluidity and motion, whereas the left is better at dealing with things in stasis]]
- [[The right hemisphere can juggle multiple ambiguous possibilities and interpretations, whereas the left hemisphere jumps to premature conclusions]]
- [[The right hemisphere can understand unclear and fleeting images, while the left requires clarity and stillness]]

----

- I would like to start of by introducing a concept coined by Robert Anton Wilson he calls [[Model Agnosticism]]
    - Wilson’s relevance to the puzzle lies in the multiple choice answers from [test.onion](https://uncovering-cicada.fandom.com/wiki/Test_.onion) which 3301 has pulled from his book The New Inquisition, which is also where this term is defined. I will be pulling a lot from this book as we go.
- I believe this principle to be at the core of 3301’s philosophy
- Model Agnosticism pertains to what Wilson called [[Reality tunnel]]s
    - [[Etic Reality]]
    - [[Emic Reality]]
- A few more terms to keep in mind:
    - [[Synergy]]
    - [[Transaction]]
- History is filled with attempts to reach certitude about the world. However
- [[The brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input]]
- Crowley repeats this point: "since it takes time for the eye to convey an impression to the consciousness (it may alter in 1,000 ways in the process!) all that really exists is a memory of the Point-Event, not the Point-Event itself." (Magick Without Tears Chapter 3 Hieroglyphics Life and Language Necessarily Symbolic)
- Question 3: Grass is only green due to a relationship between the grass, light, and your mind.
- This position is called [[Representationalism]] in philosophy
    - The idea that we only experience internal representation of reality, rather than reality itself, is fundamental to the philosophy of William Blake. As he explained in Jerusalem, ‘In your Bosom you bear your Heaven and Earth & all you behold; tho’ it appears Without, it is Within, in your imagination.’
- 3301 also asks “Disregarding color blindness, any arbitrary color looks the same to all people.”
- [[Because perception is not absolute, all of our ideas are somewhat conjectural and inferential]]
- [[The water bowls experiment]]❗️
- [[Pure Reason]]
- [[Things that philosophers thought they knew through pure reason often ended up being wrong]]
- [[The scientific method cannot lead to certainty, but only high probability]]
- [[Leap of Faith]]❗️
- [[When a system of thought becomes less than totally trivial, an infinite regress of challenges manifest and it becomes increasingly uncertain]]
- maybe include [[Godel Escher Bach Introduction A Musico-Logical Offering]] page 19. here
- “we might assume that our eyes operate like windows, letting light into our heads and allowing our ‘self’ to see the world outside. But how exactly would this work? Is ‘the self’ like a little person who watches this information, as if on a TV screen, with eyes of their own? If that was the case, would that little person also have another person inside their head, in order to watch what was going on in front of their eyes? That person would then need an even smaller person inside them, and so on to absurdity.”
- “Consider the old folk-rhyme: I saw a man upon the stair, A little man who wasn’t there. He wasn’t there again today; Gee, I wish he’d go away. This little man is a semantic spook; he exists only in the language, and yet once the language has invoked him it almost seems to make sense to wish he would go away.”

---

- So why then are we inclined towards certainty?
- [[We generally struggle to examine and criticize our own neural programs]]
    - [[Operant conditioning]]
    - [[Much of the growth of the human brain occurs after birth]]
    - [[The brain selects for the brain circuits that are most utilized throughout development]]
    - [[Imprint]]
    - [[The right hemisphere has a more loose orginazational structure than the left hemisphere]] 
- which leads to what meditation researcher defines as [[Subjective bias]]
- Why:
   - Out of this process arises the [[Left hemisphere]] and the neural circuit refereed to as the [[Default mode network]]
    - [[Posterior cingulate cortex]]
        - [[Clinging]]
            - “clinging to rules and observances (the subject of section 3)”
- [[Novelty is handled by the right hemisphere, and is transferred to the left hemisphere as it becomes familiar]]
- Thus is because [[The right hemisphere has broad, global, and flexible attention, while the left has narrow attention]]
- [[The left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]]
- [[Consciousness seems to pervade all mentality because it is not conscious of what it isn't conscious of]]❗️
    - The default mode network also gives rise to the dreaded "self" which 3301 claims will bring an end to.
    - This sense of self is applied what the Buddhists called [[The five aggregates]] ❗️
    - They call this [[Identity view]]❗️
    - ‘Self Annihilation’ is something other than death; during the horrors that unfurl in Jerusalem, a character seeking freedom from his struggles desperately cries out, ‘O that Death & Annihilation were the same!’ Blake understood the self as a mental creation separate and distinct from physical life, which can be annihilated without our bodies coming to harm.
- [[Our left hemisphere unconsciously focuses on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]]
- [[Habits develop to help the brain conserve energy]]
    - "We get hundreds of millions of sensations coming into our minds at any moment. Our brain can't process them all so it categorizes these signals according to our belief systems. This is why we find evidence to support our beliefs and rarely notice evidence to the contrary."
- here we may delineate between 2 conscious states offered by developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik
- [[Spotlight consciousness]]
- [[Lantern consciousness]]
    - the two kinds of attention are separated by the [[Corpus callosum]]
    - Although it’s not confirmed in the scientific literature, I believe the corpus callosum to be a part of this inhibitory super-structure which creates the ego
    - similar to the DMN [[The cerebral hemispheres are more independent in babies and children]] and [[Babies and children are more reliant on the right hemisphere than the left]]
- Maybe our dmn here and say something like “the left hemisphere gets its narrow attention from a structure of the brain called the dmn”
- [[We ordinarily perceive reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments]] ❗️
- [[Confirmation bias]] 
- According to Wilson, the total structure of the brain-circuitry created by imprinting and conditioning is [[What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves]]
    - This is illustrated by [[The Law of 23s]]❗️
        - "how I provoke myself into thought, or at least into neurological reactions which sometimes are not totally mechanical and predictable."
        - In The New Inquisition, Wilson mentions how William Blake—whom which he called "the first great critic of Fundamentalist Materialism"—lived at 23 Hercules Street, Lambert.
        - I believe 3301 is doing something similar with primes.
        - Giordano Bruno was born on Mount Cicada, in Italy, 464 years before the first Cicada 3301 riddle was posted online. 3301 is the 464th prime number.
        - but that's was _only a coincidence_.
        - (This is, according to Wilson "the self-hypnotic chant by which the New Inquisition banishes all evidence it does not like")
         - This, i wonder, is maybe why they chose, out of all prime numbers, 3301.
         - statue of Giordano Bruno on the Piazza Campo de Fiori, Rome Italy, designed and made by Ettore Ferrari. The location is the exact spot that Bruno was roasted and toasted at the stake, February 17th, 1600, accused of heresy by the Church for theorizing the infinity of space and having the audacity to suggest we might not be the center of the known Universe.
         - Coincidence, of course. 
         - "Is it only a coincidence that they ask "is it only a coincidence?" when I am thinking "is it only a coincidence?" That's the kind of question that got Carl Jung thinking about synchronicity"
- [[Every invention or idea first began in the imagination]] ❗️
     - The Canadian poet and musician Leonard Cohen told us that there is a crack in everything, which is how the light gets in. From a Blakean perspective, imagination is Cohen’s crack in Urizen’s closed, limited, finite universe, a way in which something new can appear, as if by magic. It is how the inspired, the world changing and the mundane can arrive from out of nowhere. More importantly, it is a direct challenge to Urizen’s belief that he is the creator god of all that exists. This explains why, in Blake’s mythology, imagination is the key to freeing Urizen from his delusions and shattering the self-imposed limitations on his perception. It is through imagination, Blake promises us, that we will be redeemed.
- Carhart Harris refereed to this as a [[Low-entropy state]]
- This can be contrasted with what he called a [[High-entropy state]]
    - Blake recognized the link between the innocence of childhood and his visions, and the importance to his imagination of maintaining a youthful mind. In his 1794 poem ‘The Angel’, he fears that he will one day become too old to still see the divine figures of his visions:

   Soon my Angel came again;  

   I was arm’d, he came in vain:  

   For the time of youth was fled  

   And grey hairs were on my head.
    - Because Blake was not initially sent to school as a child, he was untrained in gym the normal academic way of dividing the world into categories and learning lists of facts. This may be a factor in why his default mode network does not seem to have been as well defined as those of other children.
- [[The global attention of the right hemisphere precedes the narrow attention of the left hemisphere]]
- [[The right hemisphere sees the whole first, and then the left hemisphere separates it into parts]]
- [[The right hemisphere sees things in their context]]
- [[The left hemisphere sees things abstracted, isolated, and stripped of context]]
- The left hemisphere and the default mode network are embodied by a character within Blakes mythology which he named Urizen. Urizen is a personification the intellect that reduces the formless infinite void of raw experience into a compact, orderly, and finite model. This can be considered an act of creation, in which the definite appears out of the indefinite. 
- Urizen is drawing boundaries within the undefined whole of the right hemisphere 
- It is he who constructs the human-scale world of rationality and logic in which contrary positions cannot both be physically true.
- In The Book of Urizen (1794), Blake has Urizen describe his creation of the solid world while he was being buffeted by the storms that shake the realm of pure potential: "Inwards, into a deep world within:  A void immense, wild dark & deep,  Where nothing was: Natures wide womb.  And self balanc’d stretch’d o’er the void.  I alone, even I! the winds merciless.  Bound; but condensing, in torrents. They fall & fall: strong I repell’d.  The vast waves, & arose on the waters.  A wide world of solid obstruction."
- ![[Pasted image 20230224165822.png|150]]
- The Ancient of Days, one of Blake’s most famous images, shows Urizen in this act of creation. He is leaning out of a golden orb with his long white beard buffeted by the storm winds of the dark, cloudy unformed void, and he reaches down with an outstretched compass to measure the solid world he is building. 
- The scientist Isaac Newton takes the place of Urizen in another of Blake’s most famous paintings. 
- ![[Pasted image 20230224165939.png|150]]
- He is shown intently focused on measuring a circle on a scroll of paper with a similar pair of outstretched compasses. The primal void that Newton inhabits makes it look as if he is under the ocean, sat on a coral rock, yet both Newton and the paper are dry. The environment surrounding him stands in sharp contrast to the clean, clear lines on the paper that Newton is so deeply focused on. Newton’s intense focus on the mathematical shapes he is drawing is intended as an attack on the Newtonian worldview – his narrow focus makes him unaware of the larger, organic, mysterious environment in which he works.
    - Question 16: "Observation changes the thing being observed."
- Wilson also lists five stages of perception: [[The five stages of perception]]
    - stage 4 and 5: [[The left hemisphere filters experience into an abstract representation, while the right sees things without preconceptions]]
- [[The first stage of perception]]
- [[The second stage of perception]]
- [[The third stage of perception]]
- [[The fourth stage of perception]]
- [[The fifth stage of perception]]
- [[Language can be seen as a kind of metaphor]]
- [[Every word is metaphorically linked to the something in the lived world]]
- [[A metaphor implies a commonality on an experiential level, rather than the similarity between post hoc abstractions of something from those things]]
- [[All denotation and abstraction has its metaphorical roots in the lived world]]
- [[The right hemisphere sees metaphor as the means of keeping language linked to the experienced world, while language seems separate from the world for the left hemisphere]]
- [[The word "is" can be seen as a metaphor]]❗️
- [[The word "the" can be seen as a metaphor]]❗️
- [[The word "matter" can be seen as metaphorical]]❗️
- [[A languages structure and grammatic rules can distort how we interpret and percieve reality]]
    - What does the word "it" refer to in the following sentence: It is dark outside?
- [[Metaphiers eventually become their own words over time]]
- [[The kind of attention we pay to an object changes whatever that thing is to us]]
- [[Ordinary waking consciousness is more firm than other conscious states because of a continual process of reality testing]] ❗️
- [[The left hemisphere tends to be stubbornly certain, whereas the right acknowledges ambiguity and is always uncertain]] 
- [[The narrowness of certainty appeals to the left hemisphere]]❗️
- [[If our capacity to impose order onto experience becomes overbearing, it may narrow cognition]]❗️
    - "man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro’ narrow chinks of his cavern."
- At it's extreme, we can reach a stage which Wilson called [[Idolatry]] 
    - [[The left hemisphere inhibits the right more than the right inhibits the left]]❗️
    - maybe idolatry is when the left hemisphere takes over
    - The aspect of our mind that falls for this internal world and believes it to be real is Urizen, who believed that the construction of this mental model of a small part of the universe made him a creator god. Urizen’s delusion was caused by his limited awareness: being blind to what was beyond himself, he couldn’t imagine anything greater than he was.
    - [[Fundamentalism]]
    - [[clinging]] to views
    - Blake recognized that Urizen’s reason could create, but only by abstracting and dividing, and only then by becoming blind to what he was creating from. The circle he draws is finite, a limitation suggested by both explanations for the etymology of the name Urizen. The name implies both ‘Your Reason’ and ‘horizon’ – ‘horizon’ being a word derived from the Greek ‘to limit’.
    - Blake’s Urizen resembles an entity from Gnostic thought called the Demiurge. According to the Gnostics, the Demiurge is the creator of the material universe and, because he is the creator, he assumes that he is God. In this, however, the Demiurge is mistaken. There is something much greater and more fundamental behind this figure, which in The Ancient of Days is depicted as the golden orb that Urizen leans out of. Because the Demiurge is focused on the physical universe he is creating, he has his back to this greater power and is unable to see it. For those of us who are inside the physical world of creation, the Demiurge can block this pure light, making this creator a negative and harmful figure. Blake describes Urizen as being, like the Gnostic Demiurge, the ‘Creator of men, mistaken Demon of heaven’. He equates him with the ‘jealous god’ of the Old Testament. Because this figure is only the creator of the material world, the status of ‘god’ that the Bible grants him is a delusion of grandeur. Because Urizen’s sense of himself as a creator god is built on the denial that there is anything outside of him, he finds this idea extremely threatening and he uses all the logic at his disposal to ridicule it.
    - It is Urizen who has built our ego in his own image. What he likes above all other things is the idea that he is right, because this takes far less mental effort than understanding error.
    - Like our minds, Urizen has no knowledge of what he doesn’t know and deep down this terrifies him, because it threatens his very sense of identity. He will attempt to belittle, mock, or otherwise deny evidence that there is more than he knows, and that he is not the powerful creator he thinks he is. Deeply insecure, Urizen is the aspect of our minds that needs not just to be right, but to be thought of as right. You will recognize him immediately if you use social media.
- Not only can we become addicted to our views, [[we can become addicted to the way we view ourselves]]❗️
    - [[Clinging]] to a doctrine of self
- [[When we mistake our models with reality itself, we stifle our capacity to learn new ideas]]
- Like our minds, Urizen has no knowledge of what he doesn’t know and deep down this terrifies him, because it threatens his very sense of identity. He will attempt to belittle, mock, or otherwise deny evidence that there is more than he knows, and that he is not the powerful creator he thinks he is. Deeply insecure, Urizen is the aspect of our minds that needs not just to be right, but to be thought of as right.
- [[People have a tendency to become territorial over their belief systems]]
- [[Actively try to confront information that is opposed to your beliefs and expectations]]
    - "Do four unreasonable things" 
    - To make sure we do not get stuck into a particular routine and become resistant to novelty
- [[Without the potential for creative thought, people would only evaluate things mechanically through preheld beliefs]]
    - "to believe truth is to destroy possibility"
- [[Intelligent mode]]
- [[The right frontal lobes allow for flexibility in thought and behavior]]
- [[Mechanical mode]]

### The Age of Unreason

![[⚙️ Tools/📸 Images/AB4F09FF-914C-46FB-A195-0ED4C065583C.jpeg]]

##### Organize

- Koans
- "The Book of The Law anticipates much of quantum physics, existentialism, surrealism and other ideologies that emerged with the collapse of modernism in the face of the absurd world wars of destruction."
- [[Dependent Origination]]❗️
- [[The linear view of causation is only a product of recent times emerging during the late Renaissance]]❗️
- [[Conventional and Ultimate truth]]❗️
- Postmodernism also involves a culture stripped of its capacity to function in any linear or autonomous state like regressive isolationism, as opposed to the progressive mind state of modernism. Thus, the rebellion agaist modernist emergent technologies, according to Wilson, usually "takes the form, most of the time, of return to some earlier philosophy or reality-tunnel, although within the scientific community there is also a rebellion which is seeking a new reality-tunnel." I believe Wilsons model agnostisim provides an alternative approach to the postmodern age
- The Marriage of Heaven and Hell serves as a critique of Swedenborg.  In attempting to explain where Swedenborg was wrong, Blake produced an account of his own theology. Its title alone defines his main difference of opinion with the Swedish mystic. Swedenborg’s best-known and most readable book was titled Heaven and Hell. Thus Blake decided to name his work the theologically extraordinary title of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.
- For Swedenborg, heaven and hell were different and separate things. Blake, in contrast, joined the two in holy wedlock because, as he scribbled in the margins of one of Swedenborg’s books, ‘Heaven & Hell are born together.’

---

.: “Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution he will come to save you.”"

- In the time of Nebuchadnezzar II the Edomites may have helped plunder Jerusalem and slaughter the Judaeans in 587 or 586 BCE. Some believe that it is for this reason the prophets denounced Edom. Evidence also suggests that at that time Edom may have engaged in a treaty betrayal of Judah.
- Maybe the Isaiah part can link to ra hoor khuit
- Very similar to the passage from Isaiah
- "This shall be your only proof. I forbid argument. Conquer! That is enough. I will make easy to you the abstruction from the ill-ordered house in the Victorious City. Thou shalt thyself convey it with worship, o prophet, though thou likest it not. Thou shalt have danger & trouble. Ra-Hoor-Khu is with thee. Worship me with fire & blood; worship me with swords & with spears. Let the woman be girt with a sword before me: let blood flow to my name. Trample down the Heathen; be upon them, o warrior, I will give you of their flesh to eat!" Horus again forbids Because and Reason. Then things turn eschatological. Horus will make Thelemites a force against the ill-ordered Vatican. There will be great danger. But don’t worry, Horus is with you. There will be blood, Horus commands it. The woman girt with sword could be the Whore of Babylon or phallic energy within women, the feminist movement, etc.
- when are reported in his Red Book in the section called, intrestigly enough, "Liber Primus." In it Jung states:
- Jung argued that the era of reason and skepticism inaugurated by the French Revolution had repressed religion and irrationalism. This in turn had serious consequences, leading to the outbreak of irrationalism represented by the world war. It was thus a historical necessity to acknowledge the irrational as a psychological factor. The acceptance of the irrational forms one of the central themes of Liber Novus.
- I also find it interesting that both The Red Book and the Liber Primus are written in an illuminated medieval style and use rubrication
- Jung had similar visions pertaining to emending war and destruction around this time which are mentioned in the first book of The Red Book, which is called—funnily enough—"LIber Primus." Jung begins stating: "The mercy which happened to me gave me belief, hope, and sufficient daring, not to resist further the spirit of the depths, but to utter his word. But before I could pull myself together to really do it, I needed a visible sign that would show me that the spirit of the depths in me was at the same time the ruler of the depths of world affairs."
- Explain meaning of spirit of the depths
- Jung continues: "It happened in October of the year 1913 as I was leaving alone for a journey, that during the day I was suddenly overcome in broad daylight by a vision: I saw a terrible flood that covered all the northern and low-lying lands between the North Sea and the Alps. It reached from England up to Russia, and from the coast of the North Sea right up to the Alps. I saw yellow waves, swimming rubble, and the death of countless thousands. This vision lasted for two hours, it confused me and made me ill. I was not able to interpret it. Two weeks passed then the vision returned, still more violent than before, and an inner voice spoke: “Look at it, it is completely real, and it will come to pass. You cannot doubt this.” I wrestled again for two hours with this vision, but it held me fast. It left me exhausted and confused. And I thought my mind had gone crazy. From then on the anxiety toward the terrible event that stood directly before us kept coming back. Once I also saw a sea of blood over the northern lands."
- Jung elaborates on these experiences In his Memories, Dreams, and Reflections with the following: "In the spring and early summer of 1914, I had a thrice-repeated dream that in the middle of summer an Arctic cold wave descended and froze the land to ice. I saw, for example, the whole of Lorraine and its canals frozen and the entire region totally deserted by human beings. All living green things were killed by frost. This dream came in April and May, and for the last time in June, 1914 ... In the third dream frightful cold had again descended from out of the cosmos. This dream, however, had an unexpected end. There stood a leaf-bearing tree, but without fruit (my tree of life, I thought), whose leaves had been transformed by the effects of the frost into sweet grapes full of healing juices. I plucked the grapes and gave them to a large, waiting crowd ... On August 1 the world war broke out."

Within the literature there are various mentions of the coming of a new age. Blake begins The Marriage of Heaven and Hell with a poem titled "The Argument" which begins with heavy metal line: ‘Rintrah roars & shakes his fires in the burdend air; Hungry clouds swag on the deep.’ Here Rintrah is the personification of revolutionary wrath. The closely controlled language produces an ominous sense of something about to burst with relentless fury.

The next page begins with a couple of sentences which, for most modern readers, will need unpicking: "As a new heaven is begun, and it is now thirty-three years since its advent: the Eternal Hell revives. And lo! Swedenborg is the angel sitting at the tomb; his writings are the linen clothes folded up." To help us out Blake wrote ‘1790’, the date he composed that first line, above it in the copy of the book owned by his patron Thomas Butts. Thirty-three years before 1790 was 1757. According to Swedenborg, the Last Judgment – that much debated staple of Judaic, Christian and Islamic thought – had already happened, and took place in the year 1757. Most people didn’t notice because it occurred exclusively in heaven, he claimed, although the spiritual transformation it generated would, in time, affect all of humanity. The year 1757 was, therefore, when a new form of consciousness appeared on earth and, it just so happened, it was also the year that William Blake was born. You can imagine how this scenario pleased him.

Quite similarly, in The Book of the Law, Crowley alludes to the arrival of a new stage for the spiritual evolution of humanity to be known as the Aeon of Horus. The Book of the Law, according to Crowley, was dictated to him by a deity named Aiwass. The book contains three chapters, each of which was alleged to be written down in one hour, beginning at noon, on 8 April, 9 April, and 10 April in Cairo, Egypt, in 1904. The story begins on 16 March 1904, where he was trying to contact "Sylphs" (a type of air spirit common within Golden Dawn elemental rituals) while spending the night with his wife Rose in the King's Chamber of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Although she could see nothing, she did seem to enter into a light trance and began to receive cryptic messages. Rose supposedly had no interest in magic or mysticism. However, on the 18th, after Crowley had invoked the Egyptian god Thoth, she is said to have mentioned Horus by name as the one waiting for him. On 20 March, Crowley again invoked Horus, "with great success". Also, Rose revealed that her "informant" was not Horus himself, but his messenger, Aiwass. Finally, on 7 April, Rose gave Crowley his instructions—for three days he was to enter the "temple" and write down what he heard between noon and 1:00 P.M. Although the "messenger" of The Book of The Law was Aiwass, each chapter is presented as an expression of one of three god-forms: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit.

To return to The Marriage, Blake continues: "Now is the dominion of Edom, & the return of Adam into Paradise." Then Blake directs us to Isaiah 34 and both Blake and Jung to Isaiah 35: "see Isaiah XXXIV & XXXV," ." Lets unpack this.

- Edom was was an ancient kingdom in Transjordan that flourished between the 13th and the 8th century BC and was destroyed after a period of decline in the 6th century BC by none other than king of Babylon Nebuchadnezzar II. The Edomites first established a kingdom in the southern area of modern-day Jordan and later migrated into the southern parts of the Kingdom of Judah when it was first weakened and then destroyed also by Nebuchadnezzar II in the 6th century BC. 
- In the time of Nebuchadnezzar II the Edomites may have helped plunder Jerusalem and slaughter the Judaeans in 587 or 586 BCE. Some believe that it is for this reason the prophets denounced Edom, which is seen 
- "Come near, you nations, and listen; pay attention, you peoples! Let the earth hear, and all that is in it, the world, and all that comes out of it! The Lord is angry with all nations; his wrath is on all their armies. He will totally destroy them, he will give them over to slaughter. Their slain will be thrown out, their dead bodies will stink; the mountains will be soaked with their blood"
- "For the Lord has a day of vengeance, a year of retribution, to uphold Zion’s cause. Edom’s streams will be turned into pitch, her dust into burning sulfur; her land will become blazing pitch! It will not be quenched night or day; its smoke will rise forever. From generation to generation it will lie desolate; no one will ever pass through it again. say to those with fearful hearts,

- What is all being said here?
- I do not necessarily believe this is real prophecy considering the different claims in which these new ages were starting. I believe each were unconsciously sensing a change in their environment, which were delivered to their conscious in what seemed like prophecy. Lets take a look at potential parallel cultural movements.
- this new age I believe begins with the fall of modernity, and the rise of post-modernity

Modernity is said to have began with the Enlightenment (aka the "Age of Reason") in the 17th century. Some consider the era of modernity to have ended after the World Wars. The violent fall of modernity could be said to have been anticipated in The Book of The Law, as the war god Ra-Hoor-Khuit states: "Now let it be first understood that I am a god of War and of Vengeance. I shall deal hardly with them." Horus is therefor a terrifying god of war, which to me seems similar to Blake's Orc. Crowley foresaw the New Aeon as a very difficult growing up process; rather than the light and love utopia of the New Ager’s Age of Aquarius.

French Philosopher Jean-Francios Lyotard, best known for his articulation of postmodernism after the late 70s, claimed in 1979 that the postmodern was characterised precisely by a mistrust of "grand narratives." A grand narrative is a unified, complete, universal, and epistemically certain story which offers a society legitimation through the anticipated completion of a (as yet unrealized) master idea. These may include scientific progress, Enlightenment values, the Historical Materialism of Marx, etc.

- Fall of grand narratives in Book of the Law: "With my Hawk’s head I peck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangs upon the cross. I flap my wings in the face of Mohammed & blind him. With my claws I tear out the flesh of the Indian and the Buddhist, Mongol and Din. Bahlasti! Ompehda! I spit on your crapulous creeds. Let Mary inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women be utterly despised among you!" "These are fools that men adore; both their Gods & their men are fools. The Gods of the new Aeon spit on the gods and prophets of the old aeons" "Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs." "the fall of Because" "Horus will defeat Because"

The postmodern age has also been characterized by a concern for the impacts of emergent technologies on society, esspecially after the catastrophies of the World Wars, like the Holocaust and the atomic bomb. Many of these emergent war technologies are manufactured by what Wilson called the "Citadel," which refers to "the scientific-technological elite which both supports and is supported by our military-industrial alpha males," that is, those behind the rapid development of military technology during these World Wars. The Citadel, according to Wilson, "devotes most of its time and intellect to the task, as Bucky Fuller used to say, of delivering more and more explosive power over greater and greater distances in shorter and shorter times to kill more and more people." 

Blake may also be seen as a ciritic of the emergent technologies of his time, refering to the factories sprouting up during the Industrial Revolution as "dark satanic Mills." To continue with the prophetic atmosphere that has been established here—because why not—i find it interesting that the apartments Blake had died in have been demolished and a hotel was put in its place. The spot where Blake had died now lies a dark alley with noisey industrial airconditoining units, quite literally "dark satanic Mills" if you will.

3301 can be said to be a continuation of this skepticism, specifically in the digital era. Postmodernity has gone through two relatively distinct phases, the first beginning in the late 1940s and 1950s and ending with the Cold War when analog media with limited bandwidth encouraged a few, authoritative media channels) and the second beginning at the end of the Cold War marked by the spread of cable television and "new media" based on digital means of information dissemination and broadcast. The first phase of postmodernity overlaps the end of and is part of the modern period. Television became the primary news source, manufacturing decreased in importance in the economies of Western Europe and the United States but trade volumes increased within the developed core. 

The second phase of postmodernity is "digitality" - the increasing power of personal and digital means of communication including fax machines, modems, cable and high speed internet, which has altered the condition of postmodernity dramatically: digital production of information allows individuals to manipulate virtually every aspect of the media environment. 

Digitality emerged as a separate condition from postmodernity. The ability to manipulate items of popular culture, the World Wide Web, the use of search engines to index knowledge, and telecommunications were producing a "convergence" marked by the rise of "particapatory culture". This has brought producers into conflict with consumers over intellectual capital and intellectual property and led to the creation of a new economy whose supporters argue that the dramatic fall in information costs will alter society fundamentally.

Wiliam Gibsons Book of the Dead would undoubtedly be considered a postmodern art piece. For those who don't know, Its principal notoriety arose from the fact that the poem, stored on a 3.5" floppy disk, was programmed to encrypt itself after a single use; similarly, the pages of the artist's book were treated with photosensitive chemicals, effecting the gradual fading of the words and images from the book's first exposure to light. 

Wiliam Gibsons Book of the Dead is commentating on memory, and embodies the tension between postmodern emergent technologies, and "traditional" technologies in the early 90's; Traditional in this sense referring to the pre-digital structures of communication and expression. Also, it simultaneously directly challenges programmers to decipher the encryption method behind the self deleting program. Gibson wanted to start a conversation on how we imagine the present and the future.

- Crowley’s Class A works can be seen as a continuation of the Victorian occult revival, where a genre of cryptographic mystical texts briefly flourished in parallel to the medieval renaissance period in Europe.  In Medieval Europe there were two motivating factors that encouraged the encryption of texts outside of those necessary for political intrigues.  The first was the threat of the Inquisition that would correct or expunge words, lines, or destroy entire books that were deemed to be heretical to the Roman Catholic Church. The second factor was the enlightenment, where strict rationalism opposed Theosophy and Vice Versa.  So the spiritual philosophy of the Alchemists was concealed in their symbols and formula’s, while the mystical tradition of Judaism was extended to create Kabbalah out of the earlier Theosophy of the Merkabah Mystics, and was heavily infused with idea’s drawn from Gnosticism.
- - The solver Adfinem believed that "Cicada ... seems to be a modern iteration of that tradition." of esoteric cryptography involving "Crowley ... Dee, Agrippa, Trimithius and others."
- "the letters? change them not in style or value!" That is, it should be published as it were written since even the shapes of the letters have hidden intent. We see this notion echoed in the Liber Primus: “DO NOT EDIT OR CHANGE THIS BOOK OR THE MESSAGE CONTAINED WITHIN EITHER THE WORDS OR THEIR NUMBERS FOR ALL IS SACRED”
- Crowley once referred to himself as "an expert in cipher".
- one of the greatest puzzles of the Book of the Law. In 1902 he kept part of his magical diary in cipher, and he went on to use cryptography in a number of his most popular texts.  The Book of the Law, the Book of Lies, Liber Ararita, Liber B vel Magi to name but a few, involve the use of ciphers and cryptography.
- These texts were given a special ‘Class A’ category designating that they should not be altered by anyone or for any reason. The rule protects the concealed meanings of these texts from dispersing or becoming distorted over time due to good faith/bad judgment decisions on the part of later post mortem editors and publishers.
- Crowley encrypted the ancient Merkabah of the [Seven Palaces](https://sites.google.com/site/baalspalace/system/errors/NodeNotFound?suri=wuid:gx:4163f9b27d23f0fe) in Liber AL vel Legis, and it is this which is the key to all the other ‘Holy Books’.  In the Book of the Law there is hidden the Lost Word, and there is also another kind of sublime kabbalah (the secret doctrine) hidden in there.
- This is one of the reasons its draws people in to study it.  They sense there is a hidden underlying system behind the whole edifice of Crowley’s written works and this niggles at the subconscious mind to fascinate and intrigue students.
- "Aye! listen to the numbers & the words: ... 4 6 3 8 A B K 2 4 A L G M O R 3 Y X 24 89 R P S T O V A L. What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou knowest not; nor shalt thou know ever. There cometh one to follow thee: he shall expound it. But remember, o chose none, to be me; to follow the love of Nu in the star-lit heaven; to look forth upon men, to tell them this glad word. " Crowley will never understand this, says Aiwass / Hadit. Another will come to interpret this mystery (sometimes called the “Riddle of AL“). According to one translation, it reads: “Father (of) Manhood and Sexuality! O King (of) Fortune! Mighty (Beast) 666! The Second (Beast) (is come to) manhood, the youth [or child], the Perfection, the Fulfillment (of the promise), O King! Master (of the Temple), Anointed One (who hath achieved) Hadith, (long) implored, called upon and invoked, (in the name of) Athoth (shut up in silence). Tier of this Gordian Knot, the Antichrist, (thy) most Beloved One, the second beast, (thy Sword, the Sword of Horus, is here!)” But there are many more interpretations out there. I just didn’t want to leave the reader disappointed that I left this blank.
- "This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with the original in the writing of the Beast; for in the chance shape of the letters and their position to one another: in these are mysteries that no Beast shall divine. Let him not seek to try: but one cometh after him, whence I say not, who shall discover the Key of it all. Then this line drawn is a key: then this circle squared in its failure is a key also. And Abrahadabra. It shall be his child & that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall from it." Again Crowley talks about the secrets hidden in the shape of his letters. Of course, another will come an elucidate the Book and its mysteries. Aiwass goes on to offer a vague key for the operation.
- 73. Paste the sheets from right to left and from top to bottom: then behold!

  If you make a grid of all the pages from the Book of the Law, it should reveal some secret.

  Note: try this with the liber primus

- include Godels theorem somewhere here
- It also rejected epistemic certainy or the stability of meaning. Claims to objectivity are dismissed as niave realism (in our terminology, idolatry.)
- Postmodern philosophy is also characterized by the rejection of the "universal validity" of binary oppositions.
- As crowley states: "Now a curse upon Because and his kin!. Hadit curses Because and Reason. May Because be accursed for ever! ... These are fools that men adore; both their Gods & their men are fools. The Gods of the new Aeon spit on the gods and prophets of the old aeons"
- "There is great danger in me; for who doth not understand these runes shall make a great miss. He shall fall down into the pit called Because, and there he shall perish with the dogs of Reason." Those who do not understand this will waste much of the spiritual energy and waste their lives. Most of the time this is because they try to analyze the Will with Reason and logic. This becomes their pit an prison (Choronzon).
- Note: Runes huh?
- Blake included accounts of meetings with angels, but the stories were chosen to display the limits and failings of angelic understanding. As he confessed: "I have always found that Angels have the vanity to speak of themselves as the only wise; this they do with a confident insolence sprouting from systematic reasoning."
- ![[Pasted image 20230412121249.png|100]]
- Angels and Devils by M.C. Escher
- Symbolises the infinity behind our models and the coincidence of opposites
- "Thus Swedenborg boasts that what he writes is new; tho’ it is only the Contents or Index of already publish’d books. A man carried a monkey about for a shew, & because he was a little wiser than the monkey, grew vain, and conciev’d himself as much wiser than seven men. It is so with Swedenborg; he shews the folly of churches & exposes hypocrites, till he imagines that all are religious, & himself the single one on earth that ever broke a net." "Have now another plain fact: Any man of mechanical talents may from the writings of Paracelsus or Jacob Behmen, produce ten thousand volumes of equal value with Swedenborgs, and from those of Dante or Shakespear, an infinite number. But when he has done this, let him not say that he knows better than his master, for he only holds a candle in sunshine."

- Epimenides was a Cretan who made one immortal statement: "All Cretans are liars." A sharper version of the statement is simply "I am lying"; or, "This statement is false". It is that last version which I will usually mean when I speak of the Epimenides paradox. It is a statement which rudely violates the usually assumed dichotomy of statements into true and false, because if you tentatively think it is true, then it immediately backfires on you and makes you think it is false. But once you've decided it is false, a similar backfiring returns you to the idea that it must be true. 
- Gibsons art piece also sounds a lot like the discription of ... from Hofstader: "Lady Lovelace, no less than Babbage, was profoundly aware that with the invention of the Analytical Engine, mankind was flirting with mechanized intelligence-particularly if the Engine were capable of "eating its own tail" (the way Babbage described the Strange Loop created when a machine reaches in and alters its own stored program)." This may be another reason why 3301 are fond of it.

- [[The Right Man]]❗️
- Taken from the Book of Daniel, the legend of Nebuchadnezzar tells of a ruler who through hubris lost his mind and was reduced to animalistic madness
- For Blake, Nebuchadnezzar is an emblem not only of the primal man but also the man who denies the validity of true vision and chooses to worship false gods. The picture is described more fully in Daniel 4:33, the source for Blake's drawing: "he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his hairs were grown like eagle's feathers, and his nails like birds' claws."
- It is, as Prassler points out, a terrifying picture of materialism. Such pessimism is not in line with Blake's view of man's future which can be found instead in the final chorus of the "Song": "Let the Priests of the Raven of dawn, no longer in deadly black, with hoarse note curse the sons of joy. Nor his accepted brethren, whom tyrant, he calls free: lay the bound or build the roof Nor pale religious letchery call that virginity, that wishes but acts not! For every thing that lives is Holy." The Final line especially sums up all that Blake propounds in the "Body" of the Marriage itself and is the fit ending for the whole work
- "All night beneath the ruins, then their sullen flames faded emerge round the gloomy King." "With thunder and fire: leading his starry hosts thro’ the waste wilderness, he promulgates his ten commands, glancing his beamy eyelids over the deep in dark dismay"
- All subjugated lands hear and wait; prophecies and hopes of liberation run through each. When the infant is brought before the king, the jealous ruler flings him through the night and into the western sea. The sea however flees from the child, and the kind and his followers unable to stay in command fall into the wilderness left where the sea once was. In a last attempt to retain power the ruler "promulgates his ten commands" while his son of fire stamps all law to dust and frees the world from empire declaring "every thing that lives is Holy" (K. 160).

- We see the same sentiment from Emerson: "the soul, is not diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them, and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed" "In that deep force, the last fact behind which analysis cannot go, all things find their common origin. For, the sense of being which in calm hours rises, we know not how, in." (Location 553)

- Connect “LOSE OUR PRIMALITY, AND THUS OUR DIVINITY” to right hemisphere. Loss of primality is disconnection with embodied experience, emotion, and intuition. It is getting lost in left hemisphere abstraction and logical understanding, which experience my out into question and lead to new insights
    - Again, [[Babies and children are more reliant on the right hemisphere than the left]]
    - [[The right hemisphere deals with real things that have meaning to us in the lived world]]
    - [[The left hemisphere sees things abstracted, isolated, and stripped of context]]
    - [[The left hemisphere generally remains emotionally neutral]]
    - [[The right hemisphere is concerned with the self as embodied]]
- “The postmodern condition defies any single  interpretation. It is dizzying, contradictory, and by its nature difficult to pin down. This  has been one of many possible narratives, and one that at times has  maybe seemed pessimistic, but postmodernity opens up as many avenues as  it closes. We might have no guides, no priests, less legitimate leadership, but the steel cage  of certainty and oppressive authority becomes more difficult to justify and sustain itself, too. We’re pushed and pull around by emotion, desire, advertising, and consumerism, but those  same drives are the ones that sustain the drive to create new values, new ideas, and new ways of  living. We’re schizophrenic, uncertain, wandering, yet the future is – possibly – more open  that ever.”
- The Marriage of Heaven and Hell repeatedly highlights the importance Blake places on contraries. For example, at one point he divides humanity into two types of people: the Prolific, who produce and create, and the Devourers, who consume. Other writers might praise the Prolific and condemn the Devourers, but Blake understands that both types are needed to keep the world turning: ‘These two classes of men are always upon earth, & they should be enemies; whoever tries to reconcile them seeks to destroy existence.’ Not one to miss a sharp kick at religion, he adds, ‘Religion is an endeavour to reconcile the two.’
- Blake does not hide or sugar-coat his issues with Swedenborg: Now hear a plain fact: Swedenborg has not written one new truth: Now hear another: he has written all the old falsehoods. And now hear the reason. He conversed with Angels who are all religious, and conversed not with Devils who all hate religion, for he was incapable thro’ his conceited notions.
- Unlike most of Swedenborg’s critics, Blake was not questioning the reality of Swedenborg’s visions. Instead, he argued that his accounts of them were flawed and of little value. They suffered from the limitations inherent in the worldview of successful, privileged authority figures. Swedenborg was too comfortable in his own reality tunnel to question how limited it was. We all have our blind spots, of course, but not everyone wants to discover them.
- While he was quick to dismiss Swedenborg in areas that he disagreed with, he had no problem with his ideas when they appealed. In these lines, he declares this new era to be hellish and specifically identifies Swedenborg as the angel who announces it. For Blake, of course, ‘hellish’ is not necessarily a bad thing, especially when he wanted to balance Swedenborg’s pro-heaven prejudice. Swedenborg’s writings are described as ‘linen clothes folded up’, suggesting dry, dusty, corpse-like ancient texts, and not the vibrant living words that we now needed. You won’t find any exclamations like ‘Rintrah roars!’ in Swedenborg.

- [[Call-out culture leads people to self-censor in fear of mass ridicule]]
- [[Social morality is often used to decelerate innovation and maintain stability]]❗️
- Blake, as i interpret, thought that conventional morality and religion values obedience to rules and norms and the repression of ones true desires, aspirations, and creativity. "What the religious call ... Good is the passive that obeys Reason. Evil is the active springing from Energy." To Blake, institutionalized religion treated of heaven as a place of order and restraint, whereas Blake considered Hell to be not a place of punishment, a place of spontaneity and creativity. As Blake says, "Good is Heaven Evil is Hell." But as Blake says, "Without Contraries is no progression,” so therefor “Reason and Energy … are necessary to Human existence. Blake was uninterested in campaigning for one side or the other. Instead, he argued for the necessity of both. 
- He then goes on to say that "Energy is Eternal Delight."
- Blake’s “energy”:
    - [[Decreased default mode network activity may loosen the inhibitory mechanims in the brain]]❗️
    - Chaotic and creative right hemisphere / unconscious
    - Energy is eternal delight over reason because the right hemisphere is primary and more important, but both are necessary hence the marriage of Heaven and hell
- Urizen is also a controlling figure, seeking to make the world conform to the Laws he has set

- “Modern life was meant to fit together like a jigsaw. This relationship has fractured. In postmodern society, tastes, values, designs, and ideas are so broad, diverse, specialized., and subject to quick change, that agreement and consensus becomes impossible. 
- We generally look outside for guidance, but “We search for advice – top 100 films, best lasagna recipe, must see tourist destinations, whether to wear masks, which car insurance – only to find that no-one agrees.

- “Modern media ordered us – provided schedules, a few choices – the library organised the books into schemas. Now everything’s on demand, there is no categorization process, we create our own, we’re the curators of our own experience.

Authority and guidance become less trustworthy. We’re no longer babysitted. Life is much more chaotic.”
- "No one can become an expert in anything. There is too much information. Ever more specialization is key. You can no longer be a historian but must be a historian of ‘children’s fashion in Vienna in the 1880’s’. Scientific findings change from week to week. Red wine is bad, then good, then bad but for different reasons. Masks are effective, then they’re not, then they’re effective again. What does this mean for our postmodern attitude? We don’t know who to trust. We have no guidance. We’re constantly searching."

As he would write in Jerusalem: I must Create a System, or be enslav’d by another Mans.  I will not Reason & Compare: my business is to Create
- Blake had escaped from the belief that other people had authority over him. He referred to such societal constrictions as the ‘mind forg’d manacles’ which keep so many of us down. Those who recognise no masters or leaders must lead themselves and take responsibility for their own life. By taking control of every aspect of the creation, production and publication of his works, Blake was free from compromise. He could express himself freely, constrained only by his own abilities.

- Blake also attacked envy and imitation: "Once I saw a Devil in a flame of fire, who arose before an Angel that sat on a cloud, and the Devil utter’d these words. The worship of God is, Honouring his gifts in other men each according to his genius, and loving the greatest men best; those who envy or calumniate great men hate God, for there is no other God."

    - The primary precept of this new aeon is the charge "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" or in other words, one is to follow their True Will. 
- Emerson: "Man is his own star"
- Crowley: "Every man and every woman is a star"
- Blake: "He whose face gives no light, shall never become a star"
- This is all to say that, like a star, every man and woman has their own appropriate course.
- If you living according to your Will, or inner star, then you will live – not in opposition to the universal Will – but rather with it. None shall say nay because you are living the life that you should be – and the universe will reward you.
- "That is to say, every human being is intrinsically an independent individual with his own proper character and proper motion. Every man and every woman has a course, depending partly on the self, and partly on the environment which is natural and necessary for each. Anyone who is forced from his own course, either through not understanding himself, or through external opposition, comes into conflict with the order of the Universe, and suffers accordingly." (Magick Without Tears p. 29)
- "For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect." You should want to live with the Will because it is perfect for you as an individual. Not because it will grant you anything or give you the results you want. It’s just the right way to live.

I tell you, no virtue can exist without breaking these ten commandments; Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse, not from rules."
- "If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will stops & does nought. Will does not need a Reason to act. Will just acts. It is Horus the Child. And a child acts with pure innocence whether or not he/she causes joy or harm." Or as Damien says in The Omen III, “Most people confuse evil with their own trivial lusts and perversions. Now, true evil is as pure as innocence.”

    - For Blake, the enemy was the rational, dualist interpretation of Greek philosophy that was drilled into students at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. What was needed instead was the sublime inspiration of the Bible, and the great works which drew from it, which for Blake included the English writers Shakespeare and Milton. Blake believed that rote university learning of abstract ancient Greek arguments needed to be replaced by engaged creativity. As he put it in the preface, ‘the Daughters of Memory shall become the Daughters of Inspiration’.

Organize:

- For Blake, stressing the need for contraries in no way disturbed his moral compass. If anything, recognizing that things do not make sense without their opposites – whether that is heaven and hell, love and hate, spirit and matter or the Prolific and the Devourers – automatically highlights which way this moral compass should face. Should you focus on heaven and ignore hell, you mistakenly believe that heaven is everything. If you understand both, in contrast, you truly grasp why it is you choose to face heaven. Blake never forgot that it was the dynamic struggle between the two that matters, for this is the power that turns the engines of the universe. This is what keeps creation alive, vibrant and constantly dancing. This is why anyone who ‘tries to reconcile them seeks to destroy existence’.
- Swedenborg could only agree with heaven. Hellish thought was invisible to him. Blake grasped both, rejected neither and, by marrying heaven and hell, truly understood good and evil.
- In the summer of 1780, at the age of twenty-two, Blake encountered King Mob. He was walking in the vicinity of Basire’s house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields when he found himself engulfed by an angry, violent crowd. This was made up, in Gilchrist’s telling, of ‘boys, pickpockets and “roughs”’, who were ‘flushed with gin and victory’ after destroying a number of Catholic chapels. Swept along by the mass of rioters, Blake found himself at the front of the mob as they surged towards the imposing prison at Newgate. The rioters attacked the gates with sledgehammers and pickaxes. The building was set on fire and the prisoners inside screamed in terror, fearing that they would be burnt alive. Fortunately, the mob swarming the building managed to rip open the roof and drag the prisoners out of their smoking cages. Three hundred convicts were set free, many shuffling off to liberty with their legs still bound in heavy chains. As the historian Christopher Hibbert described the chaos: ‘Showers of sparks and pieces of red-hot metal shot up into the sky as iron bars and flaming beams and great hunks of elaborate masonry tumbled with a “deafening clangor … on to the pavement below.” While all the time the screaming, wild, triumphant figures of the “demoniac assailants” added the final touch of horror to the inferno-like scene.’
- On 2 June, around 50,000 Protestants had descended on the Houses of Parliament, to protest at a Catholic relief bill that allowed Catholics to serve in the armed forces. Events quickly turned ugly as protestors abused and beat members of the House of Lords and attacked their carriages. This was the start of a week-long period of the most destructive rioting in London’s history. Catholic churches and the houses of establishment figures were methodically looted, burnt and destroyed, while the prisons and breweries were opened and Irish communities attacked. Each night the flames around the capital ‘got to such a height that the sky was like blood with the reflection of them’, as Lady Anne Erskine wrote in a contemporary letter. By the end of the week, hundreds of bodies had washed up in the Thames and the army were attempting to calm the protests by methodically shooting into crowds.
- For Blake, what was significant about the Newgate burning was not the politics that drove it, but the terrifying adrenaline rush of the experience. He knew that the fire of revolution burns to some extent within all of us. It is the will to overthrow, to destroy, and to wipe the current situation from the face of history. King Mob usually sleeps, but he still dwells within our psyches.
- Blake’s response was to personify this aspect of us. He gave this spirit the name Orc. Orc plays a prominent role in the work Blake produced during the revolutionary 1790s, from his illustrated manuscripts to watercolours such as Los and Orc (c.1792–3).
- Although he is not specifically named, the ‘new born terror howling’ born in the last section of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790) is usually interpreted as Orc.
- It is not hard to imagine that Blake’s experience at Newgate had a profound influence on how he was depicted. In the Song of Liberty, he describes how a king was confronted by the newly born spirit of revolution and: "… hurl’d the new born wonder thro’ the stary night. The fire, the fire, is falling! Look up! look up! O citizen of London … The fiery limbs, the flaming hair, shot like the sinking sun into the western sea. Wak’d from his eternal sleep, the hoary element roaring fled away: Down rushd beating his wings in vain the jealous king: his grey brow’d councellors, thunderous warriors, curl’d veterans, among helms, and shields, and chariots horses, elephants: banners, castles, slings and rocks, Falling, rushing, ruining! buried in the ruins […] crying "Empire is no more! and now the lion & wolf shall cease."" Orc is fire, violence and destruction, because that is what is needed to overthrow the ‘lion & wolf’, or the king and his armies. In a few short years the French ruling dynasty would find this out for themselves.
- Orc was frequently explored as the contrary of Urizen, because the engine of progress was often powered by the dynamic struggle between ordered convention and the fire of revolution. Orc was also the serpent in the Garden of Eden, tempting Eve by recognising her repressed desire for power and knowledge. Orc is deeply anti-authoritarian. He justifies his furious 
- "I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & Delight and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness. To worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof! They shall not harm ye at all. It is a lie, this folly against self. The exposure of innocence is a lie. Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that any God shall deny thee for this." The Snake is very similar to the serpent in the Garden of Eden, promising knowledge and glory. Crowley later compares Hadit to Satan, the serpent who climbs the Tree of Life to find reunification with god, but also provides wisdom and ferocity. Hadit encourages his followers to live life to the fullest and experiement with drugs and drunkeness; promising that it will not harm them at all (similar to Mark 16:18). Crowley, of course, was a heavy drug user and an inspiration to counter cultural figureheads like Timothy Leary. Hadit goes on to say that Restriction is a lie, and that any God that demands passion, pleasure and ecstasy in this life are liars.
- destruction on the grounds that it is the only way we can overthrow what keeps us down and prevents us from reaching our true potential.
- In The Four Zoas (1797–1807), Orc was bound by his parents on top of a mountain with a ‘Chain of Jealousy’. His limbs, the rock, the chain and the vegetation all knotted together, permanently trapping him physically, but leaving his fiery imagination free to spread throughout the world. The binding of an energy was, for Blake, always a tragedy, but he recognised and understood the necessity of suppressing Orc’s revolutionary fire. He also knew that an energy like Orc would always burn itself out in time. Blake’s examination of Orc in his writing was an attempt to discover where the desire for revolt came from. Orc was the child of Los, who represents the imagination, and Enitharmon, who represents spiritual beauty. In theory, Orc should be the creation of something new and wonderful. But Orc, having been bound by those ‘chains of Jealousy’, was repressed or in shadow. As a result, he is the process by which love turns to war. In one account, the children of Los and Enitharmon are said to be characters representing wrath, pity, frustrated desire and logic. These, Blake suggests, are the constituent elements of Orc, the fiery spirit of revolution.
- "This shall be your only proof. I forbid argument. Conquer! That is enough. I will make easy to you the abstruction from the ill-ordered house in the Victorious City. Thou shalt thyself convey it with worship, o prophet, though thou likest it not. Thou shalt have danger & trouble. Ra-Hoor-Khu is with thee. Worship me with fire & blood; worship me with swords & with spears. Let the woman be girt with a sword before me: let blood flow to my name. Trample down the Heathen; be upon them, o warrior, I will give you of their flesh to eat!" 
- The stele is proof enough. Horus again forbids Because and Reason. Then things turn eschatological. Horus will make Thelemites a force against the ill-ordered Vatican. There will be great danger. But don’t worry, Horus is with you. There will be blood, Horus commands it. The woman girt with sword could be the Whore of Babylon or phallic energy within women, the feminist movement, etc. Those opposing your True Will will be trampled. Of course, as with anything written by Crowley – blood could very well mean semen. Often things like blood and death are used as symbols for sex magick.
- In 1967–1969 a crucial cultural explosion took place within the developed world as the baby boomer generation, which had grown up with postmodernity as its fundamental experience of society, demanded entrance into the political, cultural and educational power structure. A series of demonstrations and acts of rebellion represented the opposition of the young to the policies and perspectives of the previous age. Opposition to the Vietnam War, to laws allowing or encouraging racial segregation and to laws which overtly discriminated against women and restricted access to divorce, increased use of marijuana and psychedelics, the emergence of pop cultural styles of music and drama, including rock music and  the ubiquity of stereo, television and radio helped make these changes visible in the broader cultural context.
- "The highest historical concentration of wealth (real capital, and ideas generating new capital) now co-exists with the highest concentration of evolutionarily advanced nervous systems. In California, Oregon, Alaska, British Columbia. Arizona, Texas, the Hawaiian Islands, Japan and all around the Pacific, where East meets West, the world of 2000 and 2010 and 2050 is being created by persons who are veterans of a gigantic Neurological Revolution—the psychedelic pioneers of the 1960s, the graduates of the Consciousness Movement of the 1950s-70s, the synthesizers of modern psychology and ancient Oriental mind-sciences. These persons are called the Aquarian Conspiracy by Marilyn Ferguson, one of their spokespersons. They are denounced as the Me Generation by Tom Wolfe, a time-traveler from New York, i.e., from the neurological past, from a culture crystallized before 1950."
- "This is the new Power Elite. As youngsters, these Aquarian Conspirators made the Youth Revolution of the 1960s, which—whatever its excesses and blunders—permanently changed and improved student-administrator-teacher feedback in our universities; liberated our Puritan culture for some healthy hedonism; imported a dozen varieties of Oriental neuro-science (and two dozen varieties of Oriental humbug, alas); launched the ecology movement (the first planetwide perception of the difference between wealth and illth); recreated a true love of the wilderness and of wild creatures: pioneered flex-time and other liberations from economic robot-hood;* launched Women’s Lib, Gay Lib, Child Lib and generously supported Black Lib; ended the Vietnam War; spread holistic medicine throughout our culture; etc."
- Blake ends The Marriage of Heaven and Hell with the "Song of liberty." Within these two poems Blake presents a full cycle, showing in the "Arguement" the growing restlessness of the just man subdued by tyrants an in the "Song" the just mans successful rebellion. It is in this sense that the two poems are essentially related: events in the "Arguement" cause those in the "Song."
- Another image continued form the "Arguement" is that of the just man unjustly subdued. Here it is found in the new hope of all nations paralyzed by some form of tyranny. 

> 3. . . . France, rend down thy dungeon!
> 4. Golden Spain, burst the barriers of old Rome!
> 5. Cast thy keys, O Rome, intoo the deep down falling, even to eternity down falling,
> 6. And weep. (K. 159)

The final victory of the newborn babe over law is a triumph for the just men, a fitting sequal to the "Argument." The message of the "Song" is about birth and triumph of the spirit of liberty.
- The most important theme in the "Song" is the revolt against all orthodox law. As its prototype Blake uses the "ten commands" or "stony law," representing all law and his particular condemnation of the Ten Commandments, the fierce, all-just laws of the Old Testament God.

    - Emerson then mentions that as a child, there happened to be an instance in which he was admonished by a preist to follow the doctrines of the church, from which he responded "What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within?". A friend of his then suggested that his "impulses may be from below, not from above." Emerson responded saying that if he is a "Devil’s child" then he "will live then from the Devil." 
    - In the Marriage of Heaven and hell, Blake describes a ‘mighty Devil’, who we can easily interpret as Blake himself, using this technique to give infernal wisdom to humanity: "I saw a mighty Devil, folded in black clouds, hovering on the sides of the rock: with corroding fires he wrote the following sentence now perceived by the minds of men, & read by them on earth.  How do you know but ev’ry Bird that cuts the airy way,  Is an immense world of delight, clos’d by your senses five?"
    - Blake also claims to posses the "BIble of Hell," which may be interpreted as his discography.
    - To show what Swedenborg was missing, Blake dedicated much of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell to exploring infernal wisdom and knowledge. He includes a lengthy section called ‘Proverbs of Hell’, which lists the sayings he heard when he was ‘walking among the fires of hell, delighted with enjoyments of Genius; which to angels look like torment and insanity’. The hellish proverbs include some of his most quoted lines: These proverbs were intended to be universal truths. They may contain wisdom that you won’t hear from the mouths of angels, but that doesn’t stop them from being true.
    - And again, Crowley identified himself with "The Beast" from the Book of Revelation since childhood, because his mother called him that name. Throughout his life he occasionally referred to himself as “Master Therion” or sometimes “The Beast 666”. He wrote: "Before I touched my teens, I was already aware that I was THE BEAST whose number is 666."

    - [[Enabling]]
    - [[The only taboo shared by each civilization is letting people determine their own taboos]]
     - "Do that, and no other shall say nay." Obviously, if you are living according to Thelema (a philosophy that basically requires members to break social mores), you will get some push back from the followers of the word of restriction. So what is Crowley saying here? Well, according to Thelema, every man and woman is a star with an appropriate course (in the same way that a star has a course). If you living according to your Will, or inner star, then you will live – not in opposition to the universal Will – but rather with it. None shall say nay because you are living the life that you should be – and the universe will reward you.
     - Emerson: "Then, again, do not tell me, as a good man did to-day, of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations. Are they my poor? I tell thee, thou foolish philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent, I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not belong."
     - Blake’s politics were encapsulated by Los. They existed in what he created. He may have had great empathy with the poor, but he did not spend his days working to better their situation. Instead, he believed that the imagination was the tool needed to improve society, and that the labors of Los would do more to liberate people than canvassing or protesting. To do this would take integrity, self-belief, and effort.
     - Not only did they make this distinction between body in mind. They then began to prioritize and glorify the mind

- [[Neurosomatic Circuit]]
- [[Prolonged orgasm is capable of activating the Neurosomatic Circuit]]
- But what about addition?: [[Addiction only occurs in people who already have a predisposition for it]]
- [[The right hemisphere sees the body as something we live, while the for the left it is devitalized]]
- The way we thought about our bodies was starting to change in Blake’s era. Flesh was previously seen as something corrupt, weak and foul. Diets and standards of hygiene were poor and sores, insect bites and potent body odours were considered normal. Diaries and letters of the period reveal the deep repugnance many people felt about both their own flesh, and about that of others. The elaborate wigs and powders worn by the upper classes may now seem comical, but they reflected the desire for refinement and elegance over physical reality.
- Many early Christian thinkers saw the material body as the prison of the immaterial soul, and hence something to be despised. The practice of self-flagellation which runs throughout Christian history is a product of ideas such as this, although thankfully few took it to the lengths of the third-century Christian theologian Origen of Alexandria, who is said to have castrated himself for God.
- The teachings of Augustine a couple of centuries later softened these ideas. He argued that original sin was the cause of all our woes, and not simply the flesh itself. This shifted the spiritual battleground from the body to the will, and argued that we had the ability to resist physical temptation. Augustine’s excuse for bodily sins was in agreement with the Gospel of Matthew: ‘the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.’
- In Europe, by contrast, philosophers after Pythagoras insisted on a dualist position in which soul and matter were two entirely separate things. In his dialogues, Plato talked of physical objects being poor reflections of perfect immaterial forms which existed elsewhere, in some unreachable heaven. The distinction between soul and matter has since been reframed as the distinction between mind and matter, but the general principle of a fundamental separation remains.
- [[We can use our stress as a navigational tool to help guide our lives]], not rules
- [[Mindfulness can allow us to get over bad habits without cognitive effort]]
     - This is not repression, but simply close observation. If anything, its the opposite of repression. Where getting as close and personal with our sensations as we can
- If an activity starts to interfere with our quality of life, then that is an indication that we should do it less. There is no need to completely cut ourselves off from enjoyment. We should not feel obligated to renounce our lives.
- This is a clear demarcation from traditions such as Buddhism, where renunciation is somewhat of an expectation. Renunciation is a factor of the Nobel Eightfold Path. Household life is seen as incompatible with attainment. To justify this, monks claim that if a householder were to attain enlightenment, they would miraculously die in 7 days.
- ‘Those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained,’ wrote Blake in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Statements like this have earned him the reputation as a champion of sexual freedom and liberation. He saw sex as something holy and good, and often attacked the Church for its attempts to control the sensual side of people’s lives. ‘Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion […] The lust of the goat is the bounty of God,’ he wrote in the same work. In ‘The Garden of Love’, a poem from Songs of Experience, he describes how: Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds, And binding with briars, my joys & desires.
- In The Book of the Law, Crowley states: "The word of Sin is Restriction. O man! refuse not thy wife, if she will! O lover, if thou wilt, depart! There is no bond that can unite the divided but love: all else is a curse. Accursed! Accursed be it to the aeons! Hell." Here Crowley clarifies that the word of the old aeons was sin and restriction. He relates this to sex, marriage and monogomy as a form of restriction. In the new Aeon of Horus, there are no restrictions or sins as long as the individual listens to their True Will. Nuit then curses restriction. 
- "Let it be that state of manyhood bound and loathing. So with thy all; thou hast no right but to do thy will." Again, the old aeon was restrictive and odious. The new Aeon says that you have no right, except to live in accordance with the Will. This means you should only “love” (find connection with) things in accordance with your True Will. 
- The tendency of religion to deny and forbid sexuality was, for Blake, a clear sign that religion was corrupt, foolish and unholy. As he wrote in Jerusalem, ‘We are told to abstain from fleshly desires that we may lose no time from the Work of the Lord. Every moment lost, is a moment that cannot be redeemed every pleasure that intermingles with the duty of our station is a folly unredeemable & is planted like the seed of a wild flower among our wheat.’ The thought of all those lost and forbidden moments of pleasure filled him with horror.
- Blake did see desire as something to be acted on and he believed that repression was psychologically unhealthy. ‘He who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence,’ he wrote, a century before the field of psychiatry emerged.

- In the "Song" their is a continuation of the imagery introduced in the "Arguement." The smoke of Rinttrah has burst into actual flames. The child born of the "Eternal Female" (probabaly a symbol of the earth) is called "the newborn fire." As the tyrant kind hurls him through the night the description is of fire: "the fiery limbs, the flaming hair, show like the sinking sun into the western sea." Fire is also used to describe this child in other passages.
- [[The results of an action can disincentivize us to perform that action in the future]]. This cannot happen until we actually act
- As he had written earlier in the section: ‘The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom’, and, ‘You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.’ We only learn how far we can go, in other words, after we have gone too far.
- "The Devil answer’d: bray a fool in a morter with wheat, yet shall not his folly be beaten out of him; if Jesus Christ is the greatest man, you ought to love him in the greatest degree; now hear how he has given his sanction to the law of ten commandments: did he not mock at the sabbath, and so mock the sabbaths God? murder those who were murder’d because of him? turn away the law from the woman taken in adultery? steal the labor of others to support him? bear false witness when he omitted making a defence before Pilate? covet when he pray’d for his disciples, and when he bid them shake off the dust of their feet against such as refused to lodge them? I tell you, no virtue can exist without breaking these ten commandments; Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse, not from rules."
- "There is help & hope in other spells. Wisdom says: be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy. Be not animal; refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink by the eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed by delicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, let there be subtlety therein!" Be overcome by joy. But don’t be overcome by your animal nature. All action should be taken as a ritual under Will. Enjoy excess, but only with dignity. That is the subtly of the Law.
- for all its seductive appeal, should not be a goal in itself. Passive pleasure can be welcomed when it arrives, but our lives need more purpose.
- We see a similar sentiment in the LIber Primus: Enjoy excess, or "AMASS GREAT WEALTH" as it says, but "NEVER BECOME ATTACHED TO WHAT YOU OWN" and "BE PREPARED TO DESTROY ALL THAT YOU OWN."
- In the words of the Lancashire preacher Lawrence Clarkson, ‘There is no such act as drunkenness, adultery and theft in God […] What act so ever is done by thee in light and love, is light and lovely, though it be that act called adultery […] No matter what Scripture, saints or churches say, if that within thee do not condemn thee, thou shalt not be condemned.’ It is possible that there were some who made this argument who did not genuinely feel the light of Christ within themselves.

---

- The result of looking to the Bible as the source of authority turned out to be the creation of countless different sects. Amid this confusion, some radical thinkers started to argue that the Bible itself shouldn’t be thought of as the ultimate authority. Instead, we needed to look to the divine light within us for guidance. Because we needed to be free to listen to our hearts if we were to hear the Word of God, liberty of conscience became an issue of fundamental importance. For some groups, such as the Quakers or the Family of Love, this meant that the scriptures could only be properly understood by believers for whom the spirit of God lives within. Others went further and argued that, so long as you were moved by the divine spirit, the scriptures were not necessary and neither were priests and bishops. The visionary preacher Theaurau John Tany burnt the Bible at St George’s Fields in the winter of 1654, arguing that ‘the people say it is the Word of God, and it is not’. It is here, in the arguments of seventeenth-century theology, that the spark of individualism took hold.
- To believe in individual conscience and to experience the light within was to realise that you were free. For the first time, people no longer had to worry about priests, magic, hell or even sin. A person who experiences the nature of Christ, this argument claimed, was incapable of sin. They were no longer bound by the ‘Moral Law’ of the Ten Commandments. Before Christ, people needed this Law in order to understand how to behave because they did not know any better – or so the thinking went. The Moral Law may have been a blunt tool, but it was a necessary part of Old Testament society. But once Jesus had entered the hearts of men, they knew what was good and how to behave without being told. At this point, the Moral Law became irrelevant. Some argued that for a true believer all law was irrelevant, both religious and secular. This position was called antinomianism, which means ‘against law’. There is a strong antinomian streak in the work of William Blake.
- Once theologians set off down this road, it led to some radical conclusions. Some denied the existence of sin altogether and claimed that it had been invented by priests and kings in order to keep men subjugated. Others practised what they preached and took the antinomian argument to the logical extreme. Being free from law and incapable of sin, they were free to indulge in as much drinking, sex, feasting, smoking and sport as possible, and made a point of doing so publicly. In this tradition, religious gatherings were frequently held in taverns. ‘To be called a libertine is the most glorious title under heaven,’ wrote the London-born antinomian clergyman Tobias Crisp. ‘If you be freemen of Christ, you may esteem all the curses of the law as no more concerning you than the laws of England concern Spain.’ As Crisp saw things, ‘sin is finished’. A similar attitude is found in the introduction to Blake’s epic poem Jerusalem. Here he writes, ‘The Spirit of Jesus is continual forgiveness of Sin: he who waits to be righteous before he enters into the Saviours kingdom, the Divine Body, will never enter there. I am perhaps the most sinful of men! I pretend not to holiness! yet I pretend to love, to see, to converse.’
- Although the name is very loosely defined in theological terms, those who favoured these extreme views were referred to as Ranters – usually by their enemies. They were frequently held up as a warning against heretical thought, even if a grudging admiration can sometimes be detected among the criticism. ‘They are the merriest of devils for extempore lascivious songs […] for healths, music, downright bawdry and dancing’, explained one Puritan with perhaps a hint of jealousy. Blasphemy and swearing were great favourites of the Ranters, for they were a symbolic expression of freedom from social constraints and the liberty of conscience. The Ranter and writer Abiezer Coppe is said to have sworn for a solid hour in the pulpit. In 1652, a lady stripped naked during a service in the chapel at Whitehall while shouting, ‘Welcome the resurrection!’ In the heady atmosphere of the times, pigs and horses were heretically baptised. The Wiltshire rector Thomas Webbe, who had long shaggy hair and enjoyed music and mixed dancing, is said to have declared that ‘there’s no heaven but women, nor no hell save marriage’. He made this claim in his defence during his trial for adultery, for which he faced the death sentence.
- It is in the ideas of the Ranters and their ilk that we find a tradition for the political views of Blake.
- Steeped in the antinomian tradition, Blake had escaped from the belief that other people had authority over him. He referred to such societal constrictions as the ‘mind forg’d manacles’ which keep so many of us down. Those who recognise no masters or leaders must lead themselves and take responsibility for their own life. By taking control of every aspect of the creation, production and publication of his works, Blake was free from compromise. He could express himself freely, constrained only by his own abilities.

### The Reign of Fire

Name ideas:

- The Red Pill
- Hacking the Simulation

___

- [[The finite models of the universe that we cling to lead us to discard the infinity of existential reality]]
    - [[Emptiness]]
    - [[The three characteristics]]
    - [[Monad]]
    - "reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite & unknown; & all their words are skew-wise." Human reason cannot fathom the infinite and unknown. Those that try to use Reason to assess the ultimate truth as deceived.
    - The revelations imagery continues. In The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Blake says that "The ancient tradition that the world will be consumed in fire at the end of six thousand years is true, as I have heard from Hell. For the cherub with his flaming sword is hereby commanded to leave his guard at tree of life, and when he does, the whole creation will be consumed, and appear infinite, and holy whereas it now appears finite & corrupt."
    - Isaiah 35:5 "Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped."
    - He adds that ”This will come to pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment."
        -  “So where are we going if there’s no plan? Modernity means the planning and building of factories, housing, food, medicines, and products based on simple needs. But for Bauman, postmodernity is defined less by production and more by consumption. You are not what you do but what you consume–we’re defined by our music tastes, the games play, global trends, accessories, clothes,  even health and fitness become personalized. Postmodernity is driven less by reason, and more by desire, by adverts that are designed to pull us in and activate a craving. Bauman writes that ‘Seductive impulses, to be effective, must be transmitted in all directions and addressed indiscriminately to everybody who will listen.’ Shopping Malls, Las Vegas, Disney World: they all seem ordered but it’s a façade, designed to draw us in, to encourage the short-term pursuit of  pleasure with no real long-term goal.”
        - The problem with indulgence in postmodernity is that it is rooted in nihilism, and those who partake do so because they have no higher purpose. 
        - "WE CONSUME TOO MUCH BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING TWO ERRORS WITHIN THE DECEPTION: 1. WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH, OR THERE IS NOT ENOUGH. 2. WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE NOW BY LUCK; AND WE WILL NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH LATER TO OBTAIN WHAT WE NEED MOST THINGS ARE NOT WORTH CONSUMING."
    - Blake toiled away with his metal plates, acid and printing presses. He alludes to this practice in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, explaining his vision ‘by printing in the infernal method, by corrosives, which in Hell are salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid. If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.’ As Blake saw it, his printing technique was a way to bring text from the eternal realm into the world of man. By dissolving the metal, he was revealing the infinity hidden within.
    - The Greek word for revelation is “apocalypse,” and the climax of Christian teaching is in the “Revelation” or Apocalypse at the end of the Bible which tells us that there is an end to time as well as a beginning and a middle, a resurrection as well as a birth and a death; and that in this final revelation of the unfallen world all mystery will vanish: John’s symbol is the burning of the Great Whore who is called Mystery. Such a revelation involves the destruction of the present world, when the sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood and the stars will fall from heaven like ripe figs. It moves on to a new heaven and earth (i.e., an earth renewed or revealed in the form of heaven), in which the chaos of nature becomes our own garden, as in Paradise, a world no longer continuously perceived but continually created
- [[The more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world]]
    - Those with external [[locus of control]] cannot perform [[Magick]] because they do not think they can cause change to occur in conformity with will
- [[Resentment]]
- [[People become hypnotized by their views to avoid having to deal with doubt and uncertainty]]
- [[Each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty]]
    - _“neither G nor its negation can be a theorem. We have found a ‘hole’ in our system—an undecidable proposition.”_ (You can even see the corresponding hole in the drawing by Escher—it is in fact necessary for the image to “make sense.”)
    - ![[Pasted image 20230617145032.png|150]]
    - _“The fascinating thing is that any such system digs its own hole; the system’s own richness brings about its own downfall…Once the ability for self-reference is attained, the system has a hole which is tailor-made for itself; the hole takes the features of the system into account and uses them against the system.”_ No truly robust system can be consistent, and no consistent system can be truly robust.
- [[When we recognize the gamble in every perception, we realize the active and creative nature of our consciousness]]
- [[Hypnotized consciousness]]
- [[Existentialist consciousness]]
- [[Things are only existentially real to those who believe in it and select it in their perceptual gambles]]
- [[The ordinary and existentialist modes of consciousness behave like the wave particle dynamic of photons]]
    - add music part from [[The Master and His Emissary Chapter 2 What Do the Hemispheres Do]]
- [[The experienced world transcends the deterministic views of the fundamentalist]]
- [[Mastery]]
- [[Being directly aware and involved in what we are doing can increase our intelligence and creativity]]
- [[Meta-programming]]
   - [[Frontal lobe]]s
   - "Program your mind. Program reality"
   - like Agrippa, we reach in and change our own code
- Odin rune story seems to correlate with this. Perhaps the LP is some kind of metaphor for it. The runes of the LP will only reveal themselves to the worthy. Epiphany seeks the _devoted_.
    - Per https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFtf_fU7MUw:
    - "these runes allowed one to access, interact with and influence the world shaping forces they symbolized." Runes are letters, letters make up words, words make up models.
    - "the Norns, three sagacious maidens who create the fates of all beings. One of the foremost techniques they use to shape fate is carving runes into Yggdrasil’s trunk. The symbols then carry these intentions throughout the tree, affecting everything" The Norns are the unconscious self-programmers
    - "the runes do not reveal themselves to any but those who prove themselves worthy of such fearful insights and abilities"
    - Odin sacrificed his right eye (left hemisphere)
    - "Odin hung himself from a branch of Yggdrasil ... At the end of the ninth night, he at last perceived shapes in the depths: the runes! They had accepted  his sacrifice and shown themselves to him, revealing to him not only their forms, but also  the secrets that lie within them."
    - And note bipolarvangoghs supposed decryption: “WORLDTREE YGGDRASIL STANDS /BENEATH ITS BRANCHES HUMANKIND THRIVES/ AND ON THE TREES ROOTS DWELLS THE GODS"
        - message them about this once you've memorized these notes
- closing sentence: Perhaps the conspiracy theorists where right, 3301 may very well live by the devil. Perhaps it may also be in our best interest to do so as well.
- Closing sentence 2: something like “the runes shall reveal themselves to us, and we will acquire the capacity to shape our world”

- A KOAN: DURING A LESSON, THE MASTER EXPLAINED THE I. "THE I IS THE VOICE OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE," HE SAID. WHEN ASKED BY A STUDENT TO EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANT; THE MASTER SAID "IT IS A VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD." "I DON'T HAVE A VOICE IN MY HEAD," THOUGHT THE STUDENT, AND HE RAISED HIS HAND TO TELL THE MASTER. THE MASTER STOPPED THE STUDENT, AND SAID "THE VOICE THAT JUST SAID YOU HAVE NO VOICE IN YOUR HEAD; IS THE I" AND THE STUDENTS WERE ENLIGHTENED.
