title: "Projects: Obsidian"
---
Hoo boy. This project needs its entire own folder structure because of the sheer amount of components I have going.

I think my use is divided into three easily separable parts:
- [[editor|Editor]]: What I've done to the Obsidian application itself. 
- [[livesync|LiveSync]]: My use of the `Obsidian-LiveSync` plugin to encrypt, obfuscate, and back up *all* of my notes to [[my-cloud|My Cloud]]. 
	- These are accessible from any device that can run an Obsidian client.
	- I use it currently just on my laptop and phone.
- [[digital-garden|Digital Garden]]: This website. 
	- It's secretly just run out of a folder in my ^ LiveSync'ed notes repository that I have [[linux-isms#Symlink|symlinked]] into my laptop's local repository for Quartz.
