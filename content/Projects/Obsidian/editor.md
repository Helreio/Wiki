title: "Obsidian: Editor"
---
Where the hell do I start with this. It's almost as convoluted and fine-tuned as my [[Programs I Like/code-editors|Code Editors]]. This is by no means a complete or current list, I just want to highlight some of the things I've done that have improved Obsidian's usefulness to me.

### Plugins
#### Shell Commands
This thing rocks. From my laptop, I can tell Quartz to push any local changes (which I can make from my phone if I want as well, thanks [[livesync|LiveSync]]) to [[digital-garden|this website]] just by running a custom command from the [Command Palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette). No need to open the terminal.
