...It's this website.

This isn’t my first web project. I’ve created homepages for open source projects, and I started hosting [[Projects/memos|Memos]] long before I found Obsidian. However, it’s the one I expect to have the longest life. 

I'll elaborate at some point.

### Hiccups
This was a time and a half to set up RSS for. It used some bastardized form of Atom but with RSS syntax and so neither spec could parse it.

On the bright side, [one PR later](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/pull/407) and Quartz is the only project in the Obsidian ecosystem with an RSS feed.
