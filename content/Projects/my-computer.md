I run Fedora Linux with the GNOME desktop environment.

I use a [bare git repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) to backup all my small configuration files that are scattered throughout my computer. 
- Sidebar: I deviated from the tutorial and called my alias `dots` instead of `config`. It just felt better and there was no chance of confusion with Fedora's `configure` system utility.
