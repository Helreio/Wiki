## What is Ahoy?
Ahoy! is a community we always wanted to be a part of. As a result of not finding such a place, we decided to create one ourselves. Actual focus on topics like [[Knowledge/Design/UX]]/[[Wiedza/ðŸŽ¨ Projektowanie/UI]], Photography, [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]] and [[Web Development]].

The community is based on the Circle.so platform and a number of our plug-ins and products (e.g. [[Projects/EasyCart]]).
