>[!info] Software Engineering and Mobile Development Background
>- This **decentralized trading platform** is built on blockchain technology, aiming to ensure transparency and security of user transaction information. Through the immutability and distributed nature of  blockchain, each transaction is recorded on the blockchain, making transaction data openly transparent and tamper-proof.  
>- The platform's website will be designed with a **responsive layout** to ensure a seamless browsing experience for users across different devices. The system's backend will be developed using Node.js, a popular server-side runtime environment known for its outstanding performance and scalability. Meanwhile, the functionality to interact with smart contracts and the blockchain network will be implemented using Ether.js, a specialized JavaScript library for Ethereum blockchain interactions.  
>- For students, they are required to design **smart contract** functions according to their specific needs. This means they can write smart contract functions based on the platform's specific business logic and requirements, such as implementing asset exchange, transfer functionalities, or adding other custom features to meet user demands. Safety and effectiveness should be thoroughly considered in the design of smart contracts to ensure reliable execution of transactions and protection of user data
