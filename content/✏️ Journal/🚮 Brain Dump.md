#üöÆ 

___

- all the so-called useless unwholsome states in Buddhism and stoicism are not to be discarded, but used responsibly. They have their purpose because we evolved to have them

___

- I think all people are prone to adhd symptoms to some degree. They are normal from time to time. I also think that if people neglect self-control, self discipline, time management, organization skills, engage in short term gratification etc for long enough it might turn into full on ADHD. I think people tend toward this route because it‚Äôs easier. 
- When ADhD traits are associated with genetics, and when you have this notion that self-control capacity is fixed, people can blame that when ever they act that way and shirk responsibility

___

- mindfulness exercises attentional control in that it requires you to choose to keep your attention on an object while ignoring distractions

___

- mindfulness exercises cognitive flexibility because it requires us not to cling to what ever task we were doing earlier and remain present

___

- I don‚Äôt want Nibbana. Developing self control is enough for me. Craving only becomes a problem when its comulpsive and overwhelms your mind. When it controls you rather than you controlling it

___

- living in the present is the key to contentment and thus the [[serotonergic pathway]]. I think it may be integral in overcoming depression

___

- ideologies don‚Äôt win by suppressing all opposing views. They win by convincing everybody of their veracity through debate and discussion

___

- If people hold position because it‚Äôs the only views they have access to due to censorship of opposing views, then do _really_ hold those views? Do they genuinely believe in it from the bottom of their heart? Are they confident in their beliefs? Would they be able to defend them against opposition thoroughly? That‚Äôs what I think constitutes true belief. Otherwise it‚Äôs only blind acceptance 

___

- The censor wants to decide for you what you should believe and what you should not

___

- people with anxious avoidant attachment style are easily offended. Perceived rejection means loss of food supply, which makes you overly concerned with other peoples opinions

___

- I am skeptical as to wether social media is a viable platform for politics, or wether it‚Äôs inherently harmful to political movements. I question wether you want to even appeal to the minds of people prone to use social media. Wouldn‚Äôt you want to speak to those who are not prone to in-group favoritism, validation seeking, fundamentalism, etc? I feel like political movements inevitably become more concerned with social media incentives in order to actually survive in the platform

___

- I think republicans like conspiracy theories so much because they don‚Äôt challenge power structures, but only claim that the power structure is corrupted

___

- psychiatric diagnosis should be seen as [[self-referential statement]]s, i.e. ‚Äúthey seem adhd to me.‚Äù The statement ‚Äúthis person _has_ adhd‚Äù has two flaws. One, adhd is seen as a substantive noun rather than a verb, making mental illness seem immutable. Two, it seems to be referring to some objective reality, and [[psychiatric diagnosis is dependent on subjective judgement rather than empirical tests]]. ‚ÄúThis person seems adhd to me‚Äù as an adjective, aligning it with its subjective nature

___

- although I don‚Äôt think companionship is not essential for human happiness, I still do think a socia world will be better. However, I think it won‚Äôt be if people still lack meaning in there lives and center their identity validation. Social groups will end up being very tight knit and clingy and people will be suspicious of each other

____

- censorship in any area of that will prevent progress in that area 

___

- following our curiosity, interest and engagement brings us into flow. It‚Äôs how we know we are doing something important to us. Trying to persist when we are not engaged in something kicks us out of flow. We cannot fully invest ourselves In what we are doing and think of doing something else

___

- the fact that we can‚Äôt reach absolute truth implies that their will always be contraries

___

- if leftist ideology is oriented around harm reduction, some may justify silencing anyone who disagrees with them on the moral justification what they believe protects people and that they‚Äôre spreading harm 

___

- The trans movement is rooted in meaninglessness and powerlessness. Gender identity gives people a structure to organize their personality around. That‚Äôs why they care about something so meaningless as gender identity and are so defensive about it

___

- I think lack of accomplishment is another cause of depression. Feeling like you not getting anything done. Not contributing to your goals. That‚Äôs why I think people who are disorganized and procrastinate a lot also tend to be depressed

___

 People get uncomfortable when someone doubts there worldview because it indicates views that are contrary to what they believe and that they may have to reject and revise things

___

- craving is only harmful when it leads to compulsive behavior that interferes with your quality of life

___

- many people think you need to establish interpersonal relationships before you can engage in self discovery. I think it‚Äôs the other way around. You cannot find fulfilling relationships until you gets better sense of who you are

___

- Psychiatry only cares wether people conform to what they have decided is ‚Äúgood.‚Äù Psychiatry is not oriented around helping eliviate popele from suffering. They see them as a problem to be solved. It‚Äôs often them that determines wether someone needs help, not the patient. That‚Äôs why so many kids get diagnosed with ADHD and Autism. You bet yours as these kids didn‚Äôt ask for help from the psychiatrist

___

I think the reason people scoffing at the Cicada lit bothers you is because it invalidates your beliefs and interests

___

- censorship also forms echo chambers because when people are censored on one platform, they simply go to another platform that allows them to express those views. The result is that both parties are isolated into echo chambers where they are not being exposed to contrary beliefs

___

- people are not build themselves up to the acceptance of an ideology by slowly accumulating knowledge about it or overtime from the bottom up, contending with counter arguments, etc. They‚Äôre just adopting the basic tenets of that ideology from the top down so they can feel like they‚Äôre a part of a group, then they try to justify those beliefs only after the fact, if they even do that at all

___

- it is sad when leftists cannot express why things like facism is wrong and resort to censorship. There‚Äôs nothing keeping people from joining at that point. There‚Äôs nothing keeping you from excepting those ideas except dogms
- the counter to bad speech is more speech, not censorship. Censorship just drives bad ideas into protected echo chambers where the participants enter a feedback loop, increasing the extremism of their views
- Ideas should prove there veracity through defending there selves and debunking alternatives, not because they‚Äôve been forced on everybody through censorship
- It‚Äôs useful to listen to the other side because sometimes the other side is the _only_ one criticizing yours

___

- People have a tendency to confuse providing immediate comfort and relief with actually helping people, even if it‚Äôs harming them long term. Directing people to solutions that may not me immediately gratifying is seen as cruel.
- I think this is prevalent on the left with their tendency to coddle

___

- the left hemisphere is responsible for daydreaming since [[the left hemisphere perceives time as a sequential series of fragmented individual moments]]. It only pays to individual instances if things, whereas [[the right hemisphere handles alertness, vigilance, sustained attention, and divided attention]]

___

- censorship prevents people from learning new ideas. It constrains knowledge into a narrow set of acceptable views. It may prevent people from learning something that may turn out to be true like with the lab leak

___

- People create a idealized image of themselves to cope with underlying insecurity, so when they are trolled, their self image is threatened and their underlying insecurity is triggered

___

- killing should be allowed at a certain level of consciousness. Consciousness varies between creature to creature. There isn‚Äôt a dichotomy between sentient and non sentient creatures. Our own consciousness varies throughout our lives. There isn‚Äôt a point in which we suddenly become conscious.

___

- leftists have this false dichotomy that stress is either completely social or completely individual, and they tend to dismiss individual solutions to stress. Why not both? Why can‚Äôt we take steps to manage stress out selves but still seek to remove it‚Äôs source

___

- epathy is dependant on our own experience of pleasure. It cannot be completely altruistic

___

- the three characteristics should be used to develop patience. Not renunciation. The goal should be to remove sources of stress, but be able to endure it in the meantime
- You should indulge to the extent that it forms not start to lower the quality of your life, i.e. getting unhealthy
- Desire is not inherently painful and can be healthy depending on what it‚Äôs directed towards. Somethings are more unsatisfying than others

___

- the opposition toward vaccine skepticism has an underlying prejudice that vaccines always work and you can never go wrong with them. So many articles talk about ‚Äúwhy people are antivax‚Äù as if they‚Äôre saying people should never be skeptical of a particular vaccine

___

- There are certain contexts in which I think uprooting the three unwholesome roots is distasteful, especially political. We should not be adverse toward oppression conditions? We shouldn‚Äôt desire better?
- There are certain pleasures that I do not think are harmful at all, namely delayed ones like working out

___

- science becomes dogmatic through the subject object distinction. The idea that our models are not created by us and that we‚Äôre not just making best bets. That our model as it is right now is how the world actually is

___

- anarchy is right hemispheric in that it organizes things organically and flexibly without trying to impose some kind of rigid pre-configured structure and force things to conform to it. Organization occurs out of the present moment spontaneously and through non-forcing

___

- I think the knee jerk opposition to philosophical discussion on the cicada server might have to the with people who cling to the materialist paradigm and feel threatened by non-materialist discussion
- That‚Äôs why they can‚Äôt just ignore it. They can‚Äôt stand to see someone analyze the world in a non-materialist manners

___

- mania might have to do with overexitability combined with an easily overwhelmed prefrontal cortex. Say you make a connection between two ideas, then you get exited and feel an ego boost from feeling smart. Then you start seeing connections everywhere, and you get lost in this excitement

___

- censorship isolates right wing extremists into there own little echo chambers where they‚Äôre shielded from rebuttal and makes there extremism worse 

___

- I feel like self control, equanimity, delayed gratification, flow, etc will actually improve the quality on my life, whereas with Nibbana, I feel like your sacrificing so much if what makes life rich and exciting, like art, culture, comedy, etc., for perfect bliss that I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs worth it
- It shouldn‚Äôt be a matter of things being either in or out of our control. Technically anything can be in our control. It should be about patient and self control with the intention to still make change eventually
- It‚Äôs not that passions shouldn‚Äôt arise at all. You should be able to simply not have them overtake your mind. You should be able to step back from them. But the goal is still to ultimately satisfy them

___

- I think depression starts off in the right hemisphere as depressive realism, and is transferred to the left hemisphere once that attitude becomes habitual, and then it actually becomes a ‚Äúcognitive distortion‚Äù where you expect everything to be negative and narrow attention on negativity while tuning out everything positive

___

- I personally apply [[the three characteristics]] to short term gratification because with [[delayed gratification]] you can‚Äôt really go wrong. Delayed gratification tends to aggregate whereas short term gratification tends to bring only short term immediate gratification and aggregate negatively long term

___

- in the face of an incoherent late capitalist world, rather than embracing complexity and uncertainty and learning things slowly and iteratively while acknowledging that they‚Äôll never reach absolute understanding, they instead look for short term relief through some simplified and certain world view

___

- A lot of men I believe are making there lives a lot harder ivensting George energy into dating than it would be if t they redirected that energy toward things they enjoy and care about. But there‚Äôs this idea in our society that interpersonal relationships are some kind of prerequisite before you can start enjoying your life

___

- I hate the word pseudoscience because it always implies that what ever it‚Äôs referring to has scientific intentions or is trying to come across as science
- Secularists often use it to dismiss things that don‚Äôt align with science, but not every idea that isn‚Äôt predicated on science is not useful, I.e. philosophy, ethics
- They often say that the problem with something is that it‚Äôs unscientific, rather than because it hurts people

___

It‚Äôs not necessarily that secularists strip mediation from mysticism. They just think that mysticism is another word for superstition and religion, so they end up trying to take a secularist approach to meditation which never works out

___

- meaning can only be established on your own initiative. Meaning and context go hand in hand. When we are not in control of our environment and someone else is directing what we should do, those things lack context for us and therefore meaning. We‚Äôre not doing things because we see it‚Äôs importance, but because we were told to arbitrarily

___

In regards to the paradox of tolerance, how do you know when speech is intolerant? Is that not a subjective judgment? And if so can you not play mental gymnastics to interpret any kind of speech you don‚Äôt like as intolerant and worthy of being silenced, therefor giving way to dogma.
And couldn‚Äôt the authority doing the censorship censor something based on a misinterpretation of it as intolerant?

___

- striving is psychologically healthy depending on the context

___

Mcgilchrist may be right in that there are many things that we can‚Äôt control. But if we _could_ control something, such as our work, then we should strive to be able to do so

___

- I feel like Nietzsche over generalizes slave morality and it becomes a justification for oppression. Then any attempt at emancipation is just viewed as slave morality and society stagnates

___

The whole neurodivergence idea is a slave morality. [[Psychiatry plays a moralizing role for society by defining behavior in terms of normal and abnormal]]. Normal was what you are supposed to be for psychiatry. The neurodivergence crowd flipped the morality and decided that to embrace your mental illness was good 

___

- the [[Conformity|conformist]] operates in [[Mechanical mode]] in that they strictly within the within the rules of a social system and does not attempt to modify them

___

- because [[slave morality]] values weakness, it tends towards [[enabling]]. The slave thinks people should never feel any degree of discomfort

___

- The biggest mistake in the scientific revolution was taht it never addressed the real problem with religion. The purpose religion serves for society was to provide certainty, stability, and a sense of communal striving. The problem with religion was rigid dogma, rejection of viewpoint diversity, and moralism. Science came to the conclusion that what was wrong with religion was simply that it was superstitious, non-empirical, and based in unverifiable evidences. This allowed for new movements to arise which serves the same purpose but was stripped from its religious connotations, therefor seemingly making it ok

___

- Those who claim mental illness demand that people accommodate to them, rather than them putting forth to adapt to the circumstances 

___

The problem isn't that there aren't enough right wing voices. Its that the left has so ideological homogeneity that you can even criticize the more ridiculous views coming from the left as a leftist. To say that the solution is to create more right wingers or something sound almost supportive of the right wing movement

___

- If [[education should be oriented toward whatever is important in the students particular culture and environment]], then you should commit yourself to learning something only to the extent that you‚Äôre engaged. [[The cognitive science approach to learning strips it of it's context and meaning to the student]]. With the wide adoption of this learning strategy in schools, we have become so accustom it that we come to believe that we must trudge through material even if we‚Äôre not actively engaged in it. If you have to push yourself to keep engaging with the material, then you're probably learning it arbitrarily.
- You should never learn something because you feel like you _should_ learn it. You should always be able to provide a reason for why you've decided to learn a given topic.
- If you _are_ engaged with the material then that means that it has context and meaning to you. You have a sense as to why whatever it is you're learning is matters. If you are not engaged in the material, then you should set it aside until you do feel engaged with it.

___

- Buddhism is right that sensual pleasures are unsatisfactory. I think it‚Äôs wrong for the notion that striving for something causes suffering. It all depends on what your striving for. If life is oriented around short term pleasures, your life will feel substanceless and you will always be dissatisfied. If it‚Äôs oriented around a goal higher than yourself, like self-mastery, a political ideal, etc. then striving can actually be healthy and a scourge of happiness.
- Buddhism is right that sensual pleasures are unsatisfactory. I think it‚Äôs wrong for the notion that striving for something causes suffering. It all depends on what your striving for. If life is oriented around short term pleasures, your life will feel substanceless and you will always be dissatisfied. If it‚Äôs oriented around a goal higher than yourself, like self-mastery, a political ideal, etc. then striving can actually be healthy and a scourge of happiness. The Buddhist would believe that such striving comes with it the potential for disappointment, and that striving in and of itself indicates lack and therefor discomfort.

___

- if concentration is so dependent on motivation, then you need to establish that motivation. In my opinion, through developing dispassion for short term gratification through the application of [[the three standpoints]] 
- and through mindfulness
    - [[we can use our stress as a navigational tool to help guide our lives]]
    - [[Mindfulness can allow us to get over bad habits without cognitive effort]]
- Otherwise you are arbitrarily forcing yourself to focus on something
- Concentration itself seems to be considered a virtue in and of itself regardless of what it is being directed towards. Probably because of out of context material in schools and [[the adaptive function]].

___

- I think people who are high all the time are compensating for something. If you have to be high to feel better about your life, then somethings wrong and you should be addressing that instead of covering it up with drugs. Sober life should so enjoyable that you don‚Äôt need drugs to enjoy it. If you live a satisfying life I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be driven to get high all the time. Drugs should always be done for fun rather than to alleviate stress. You should deal with that stress upfront

___

- because mental illness symptoms represent things that all people experience at least to some degree, and [[psychiatric diagnosis is dependent on subjective judgement rather than empirical tests]], then if you get diagnosed with a disorder, people will pay extra attention to those behaviors in you specifically and since their is no empirical way to distinguish you from those considered "normal," you will never escape that diagnosis. They will assume that when you exhibit those behaviors, its caused by the disorder, but when anyone else does, then "it just happens sometimes." They will think they're are being considerate and helpful when they recognize these behaviors in you in this way, and will not see anything wrong with what they're doing. They will believe they're doing a good thing

___

- The whole idea that ADHD makes it harder to do things we're not motivated to do is making me question the nature of motivation itself
- Why should we do things were not motivated to do?
- What about we pay attention to the negative aspects of, say, not doing chores, and use that as the basis to motivate you into doing them
- if you have adhd, you may be in the right to not do things you are not motivated to do

___

- weed works like basically every other drug. You build tolerance to it which in turn makes the endogenous neurochemicals for that receptor less effective. Thus if you use it frequently, then what ever symptoms you were trying to treat with it are actually made worse in the long run. If meth is the drug for the Mesolithic pathway, ssris are the drug for the serotoninergic pathway, etc., then weed is the drug for the endocannabonoid pathway, and acts on it in the same way that these other drugs act in there respective pathways

____

- time blocking can help with cognitive control because it gives a clearer idea of what you should be paying attention to at the moment

___

- a lot of leftists act like finding some sense of enjoyment in life makes your complicit with capitalism. They seem to have this super pessimistic attitude that you gotta be miserable in a capitalist society.
- They also seem to think that our economic circumstances , rather than themselves, should undergo improvement, and that self improvement is some kind of propaganda to make you docile
- It‚Äôs true that capitalism overvalued individualized solutions to economic problems, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that the entire solution to stress is economic and social

___

- I think what matters more than renunciation is self-control, delayed gratificstion, anti-fragility, contentment, and being in flow
- There are certain situations where I think non-aversion sounds bad. There are certain things I think _should_ stress you out, ie capitalism. To become non reactive to it and not seek to abolish it sounds complicit. Wheee as resilience doesn‚Äôt imply that you won‚Äôt seek to improve conditions. It only means taht when things are bad and you can‚Äôt change it immediately, you can withstand it with
- Buddhism seems to have a similar assumption to freud that humans beings are primarily motivated by avoiding pain and seeking pleasure. It doesn‚Äôt seem to take into account something like frankls Will to meaning. It isn‚Äôt indulgence in and of itself that‚Äôs harmful and brings suffering, nor is striving. The problem arises when we have no higher purpose beyond pleasure seeking to strive for, and thus our happiness becomes dependant on cercumstances which we are constantly trying to maintain. You‚Äôre whole life begins to revolve around pleasure. You can only develop a healthy relationship with pleasure once you establish a proper sense of purpose
- Ascetic types seem to think that if a behavior is causing them long term harm now, then it‚Äôs the behavior in and of itself that is harmful, rather than the frequency at which they‚Äôre doing it. But simply limiting how much you do that thing is _still_ developing self-control, delayed gratification, etc. There‚Äôs no need for self denial. There‚Äôs always two extremes being espoused, and that is either complete indulgence or complete self-denial
- you dont have to give up the joys of pleasure to live a happy life

___

- If we direct our education toward what is useful and meaningful for us, and it involves addressing problems we encounter in the real world, then there are bound to be other people who will relate and also find our insights useful. This is a way we can find an occupation without taking a pre-planned path

___

- Is it not just a theory? All theories are _subjective_ interpretations. All we can say is what we _think_ the message the puzzle is trying convey is. There is no objective way to interpret the puzzle, and thus no objective standpoint from which we can judge other interpretations as "misinfo" that should be censored
- and if you think im defending the priory theory then you're completely missing my point
- And why assume that all theorizing and philosophical/speculation and discussion is done with the intention to solve? Why not let people engage in theorizing and philosophical speculation unrelated to solving? Why do you have to protect people from it by censorship? I feel like this is less about preserving "truth" and more about constraining others into your belief system
- I just dont want you guys to start censoring that kind of stuff with the _pre-concieved_ notion that this puzzle is only about cryptography, and thus any other kind of discussion is "misleading"

___

- I feel like the whole campaign agianst "misinformation" is less about preserving "truth" or whatever and more about constraining them into their belief system
- This could probably be said about censorship in general
- They want everyone to believe what they believe so they never have to worry about congitive dissonace

___

- I‚Äôve seen this narrative that the cicada puzzles are just for fun and have no higher purpose behind it.
- I‚Äôm noticing people who seem 
- These people seem to be uncomfortable with the whole idea of striving toward a higher purpose in life beyond trivial pleasures. I think cicada is a source of escapism. They want it to only be a pointless game. You get this knee jerk retaliation from people who feel like their source of escapism is being threatened 
- What makes you so sure that‚Äôs the only point of the references? Do you really know enough about them to say that? Why tell everyone who suggests a deeper meaning, coherence, etc that ‚Äúit‚Äôs only a theme look no further.‚Äù
- it doesn‚Äôt matter wether it has puzzle solving potential, all I‚Äôm saying your not qualified to say that
- Not saying they found anything btw. They literally creamed themselves over some random Blake pdf they found online and lost all capacity for critical thought

___

- Flow:
- consciousness is only necessary when we are in the process of learning a new skill, which requires willful effort
- Habit is left hemispheric: [[Novelty is handled by the right hemisphere, and is transferred to the left hemisphere as it becomes familiar]], [[Low-entropy state]]
- flow is right hemispheric because 
    - [[The right frontal lobes allow for flexibility in thought and behavior]]
    - [[The right hemisphere is better at dealing with fluidity and motion, whereas the left is better at dealing with things in stasis]]
    - [[The global attention of the right hemisphere precedes the narrow attention of the left hemisphere]]
    - [[The right hemisphere is concerned with the self as embodied]]
    - This is why people often describe it as feeling like your out of your body and not controlling it

___

- when people believe that strong interpersonal relations ships a a prerequisite for being able to enjoy other aspects of their life, then they put that stuff off and then they try to force relationships with people rather than allowing to arise naturally which makes them more repulsive which then makes them try harder which makes them even more repulsive and so on. It‚Äôs a virtuous cycle. And their self esteem gets worse and worse
- All the while they are neglecting the qualities that would make them a person worth having a relationship with, which is engaging in self-discovery and developing a personality
- Any relationship that is done out if obligation is an unhealthy one. A healthy relationship should always be natural

___

- nobody ever questions why incels care so much about women in the first place. Or why people in general care so much about friends and validation. It‚Äôs always the same old excuse, ‚Äúwe are just inherently social creatures.‚Äù No matter how extreme their desire for interpersonal relationships are, it always seems to be seen as something that still needs to be fulfilled 

___

- when people say god is bad because he doesn‚Äôt exist, they start thinking that knowledge should be oriented around what can only be empirically verified, which discounts everything outside of science
- I also notice these people interpret everything associated with religion in this way without actually reading anything and it gets thrown under the bus

___

- [[Distinct brain networks are able to communicate and connect more openly when the default mode network is inactive]]
- I think this happens in the right hemisphere since is is already less specialized: 
- the left DMN is silenced, allowing extra signals in. The right hemisphere processes all of this novelty: [[Novelty is handled by the right hemisphere, and is transferred to the left hemisphere as it becomes familiar]]. That may be where more of the neuroplasticity occurs in attempt to process it all 

___

- I believe inattentiveness to involve how [[The overactive stress response of those who had a stressful childhood leads to an overvaluation of short-term relief]]. 
- [[Stress causes the amygdala and HPA axis to quite the prefrontal cortex by flooding it with dopamine and cortisol]]
- Being more sensitive to stress, things are more stressful for them than would be to others
- And with already having impairments in the [[prefrontal cortex]], their capacity to differentiate between immediate term and delayed gratification is easily overwhelmed under stress
- They can only pay attention whenever something is pleasant and easy, and whenever the going gets tough they will immediately switch tasks to something easier
- I believe the hyperactivity symptoms are caused not by a lack of [[dopamine]], but from down-regulation of [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s from over-indulgence in the short-term relief, therefor requiring constant stimulation in order to keep [[dopamine]] levels up.
- I think reactivity is at the core of ADHD. Reactivity determines how long you can maintain your attention. I also notice during meditation that compulsive day dreaming and mental proliferation always begins with noticing something in your experience and having some thought about it arise, which leads to the next thought and so on. Before you know it your [[posterior cingulate cortex]] is sucked into the process without even thinking about it. Although some thoughts do come out of nowhere, kind of like reminders, ie ‚Äúcant forget about that,‚Äù ‚Äúcant wait to do this,‚Äù etc. I believe they‚Äôre imbedded in the default mode network whose cue is to activate when ever we‚Äôre not doing anything
- What I don‚Äôt like about how ADHD is usually characterized is that It‚Äôs not really about complaints from the victim, but more about complaints from authority. Authority gets frustrated because they can‚Äôt get children to focus on things _they_ want them to focus on. It‚Äôs never diagnosed because the child has trouble focusing on what they know is important and wants to improve that skill. It‚Äôs usually never the child going to get their own diagnoses in order to improve their own lives, but authority trying to get the child diagnosed for their own objectives

___

- Mindfulness can exercise our [[right hemisphere]].  [[The right hemisphere handles alertness, vigilance, sustained attention, and divided attention]]. It also can put us in touch with the [[right hemisphere]]s big picture ‚Äúbackground‚Äù attention, as [[the global attention of the right hemisphere precedes the narrow attention of the left hemisphere]]. 
- Also, [[novelty is handled by the right hemisphere, and is transferred to the left hemisphere as it becomes familiar]].
- helps keep the mind from slipping into the [[left hemisphere]]s compulsive [[habit]]s and disembodied mind-wandering through forgetfulness and mental proliferation

___

- by concieving of mental illness as vices in contrast to virtues, mental disorders become not nouns but adjectives, a way of being and behaving. Therefor it also becomes subjective. It‚Äôs not some objective inherent aspect of someone where trying to find, but something that to me seems that you exude. You don‚Äôt _have_ ADHD, you seem ADHD to me, or relative to them

___

- as long as your humble about what you own and recognize your privilege, I think it‚Äôs ok to possess pleasures. It‚Äôs harmful when you are dependant on them for happiness and therefor cling to them, are defensive about them, etc

___

- any relationship that does develop out of cold approaching is probably _not_ going to be a good one. Any person who accepts that shit is probably going to be desperate too
- You can‚Äôt meet people with common interests if your whole personality revolves around making friends because you‚Äôll put no time into developing your interests in the first place. This is the predicament people fall in who think relationships are necessary to human happiness and think they need friends first before they can pursue other things they enjoy. They never develop qualities that would make them worth spending time with in the first place
- People who think relationships are necessary for happiness will rather be in a relationship that lowers the quality of their life for the sake of not being alone, even if they would be happier that way

___

- I think people should go on a solitary journey toward self discovery before approaching social spaces. I feel like most people approach social spaces not because of the value it adds to their life, but because they are afraid to be alone.
- I think this is what a lot of leftists do. They don‚Äôt really care about leftism but more about not being alone. They structure their spaces in a way to strengthen the tightness of community rather than to promote progress

___

- I don‚Äôt even think a lot of leftists even consider the oppressive nature of psychiatry because they‚Äôre so caught up in the narrative that the disordered are less fortunate and that they must stand up for them 

___

- new age spirituality is metaphysics for extremely distressed people to cope with there lives. That‚Äôs what all the positive energy type of stuff is for

___

- people came to think that since bias and dogma are emotional attachments, then it is emotion that is in the way of ‚Äútruth,‚Äù but the assertion of truth is what leads to dogma in the first place! Thus emotion became the enemy

___

- I feel like anti-hatespeech is being used as an excuse to silence anything critical of the left at this point, as to the left anything critical of it must inherently be hateful

___

- I feel like the way out of suffering is not to give up pleasure but instead to see the value of suffering
- Even if things are impermanent, you can still enjoy them while you have them

___

Getting rid of capitalism will not get rid of stress. Things such as work will still be required. Anti-capitalism is not the remedy to all of our problems. There will still be conflicts if capitalism is abolished

___

Non-forcing implies non-attachment to outcomes, but not to the pursuit of things like Buddhism does. According to non-forcing doctrine, it is ok to pursue things as long as you do it flexibly and without an attachment to it going a certain way

___

When leftists oppose mindfulness and religion, I would ask them ‚Äúdo you really think we should completely abandon these values? Do you think people should unconsciously react to short term gratification? Or obsessively ruminate over things?‚Äù

___

I agree with Buddhism in that it‚Äôs good to build resilience to painful feelings, it‚Äôs good to overcome craving for trivial things like junk food, drama, mindless consumption, etc., but I‚Äôm not sure that should mean having to sacrifice things were passionate about, our aspirations, that‚Äôs that being excitement and joy. Do those things really bring suffering? If they do would that suffering be worth it? Are they really unhealthy? I can‚Äôt say I find becoming some completely stone cold non reactive person who is not entised by anything sound particularly appealing. Overcoming those other issues does sound appealing tho

___

Psychiatry began with the assumption that mental illness was inherent and immutable with no real evidence, because it played a moral role. They have basically been trying to create neurological theories to justify that preconceived belief which have never been backed up by evidence

___

Capitalism makes people more greedy by making them fear loss more. People think if authority were to be abolished, these tendencies would be unleashed. But they‚Äôre seeing it out of context. If people could take as they please, I doubt they would hoard, because they know that loss is not detrimental

___

- [[Psychiatry has not yet been able to come up with laboratory tests for psychiatric conditions]]
- [[Synaptic connections are strengthened or weakened through life experiences and frequency of use]]
- Then from what standard can we distinguish between mentally Ill and normal?
- I believe mental illness is rooted in variations in brain structure size and receptor density, which varies on a continuum and distinctions cannot be defined. Brain structures can grow or shrink depending on use, and receptor numbers can increase when they‚Äôre not being overstimulated, which improves sensitivity. So the big point here is that we have the capacity to overcome mental illness. I believe genetic explanations are a means of reifying mental Illness and dodging responsibility. I also think it‚Äôs a form of slave morality, denying responsibility to guilt people into sympathizing with you, turning your shortcoming into virtues, ie how it is being touted as a good thing and courageous to embrace your short comings
- I do not think people should be shamed for their short comings, but progressives distort this into meaning that any criticism or encouragement to improve is discriminatory 

___

- herd morality may be so rampant on the left because most people identify as leftist in order to find sine sense of communal striving. The herd morality is there to maintain that community

___

- people tend to think intelligent people who hold different beliefs from the norm are mentally Ill or even less intelligent 
- They deviate from the norm and are thus more likely to be misdiagnosed with mental illnesses such as autism simply for their eccentricy
- School might actually be too slow pace for them, causing bordem and possibly leading them to fall behind. This can easily be mistaken for learning disability
    - you only get diagnosed as having LD when you don‚Äôt learn what authority says is important to learn
- highly intelligent people understand things that are hard to comprehend easier than average people. Thus many of the ideas they express may not immediately make sense to other people and they‚Äôll think it‚Äôs nonsense
- Especially if you only feel suspicious of society intuitively, and you struggle to articulate it. If your thought process isn‚Äôt completely coherent  and explicit, people won‚Äôt see where your going with it and will blow it off as a madman raving

___

- zettelkasten can prevent the dunking Kruger effect by bringing awareness of the nuance of things
- And how little we really remember of what we learn

___

- you cannot know what your going to be interested in in the future. You can only know what your interested in now. Otherwise your constraining yourself

___

- [[The scientific method cannot lead to certainty, but only high probability]]. Thus the term ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù in science implies such certainty has already been established and that everything contrary to these opinions are wrong. 
- Notions of misinformation have to potential to put a halt to scientific progress.
- If Copernicus were censored for ‚Äúmisinformation 

___

- we should let people decide what is ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù for themselves based on the data. We should not have authorities who are arbiters of objectivity for everyone else

____

- once you define who you are you set the confines of who you will become
- If you identify with being adjective, then you have to remain a doctor in order to preserve you identity
- If you do not idenitify with anything, you can say and act how you want when you want

___

- Many things we think are are beneficial are harmful long term
- Many people seem to think making someone feel good now by giving them what they want will do the job

___

I think one of the problems with calling it esoteric and spiritualist is that it doesn‚Äôt really imply that it the ideas presented there should be grounded in the puzzle. So there‚Äôs the possibility that some people will apply any arbitrary ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù interpretation to the puzzle without linking it in any real way to the references or the puzzle itself. Then you get people saying things like how ‚Äúcicaidism‚Äù is _clearly_ an ‚Äúesoteric tradition of epistemology to guide the initiate toward unlocking his metaphysically objective higher self in the astral plane‚Äù or that ‚Äúlike the instar we must find the divinity deep within our pussy chakra and emerge,‚Äù etc. And you‚Äôll even have those who just stray off-topic entirely, posting random fringe conspiracy documentaries, some random new age guru lecture, etc. That‚Äôs at least what I‚Äôve noticed in my time here.

Like ctvrty said, the name attracts the wrong people. 

People see that channel name and then see it as an opportunity to post their irrelevant crazy theories and nonsense. Tbh I think everything said in that area should somehow link back to the puzzle and references in some way, otherwise you risk it being filled with irrelevancy. If you just have ‚Äúliterature-art-references‚Äù for example, people would have to make sure everything they say there would always be grounded in that. Idrk just an idea. It shouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äúcontainment zone‚Äù or whatever, irrelevant ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù rants probably just shouldn‚Äôt be allowed overall 

I don‚Äôt really think the name is completely relevant to the objectives of the channel stated in the description

Another problem with the name ‚Äúesoteric spiritualist‚Äù is that the puzzle and references, I believe, extend far beyond mysticism to topics such as epistemology, anti-censorship, free speech debate, privacy policy, social critique, criticism of conventional morality, group psychology, individuality, and more. I sometimes find myself struggling to figure out what the appropriate channel to post certain things would be. Only word I can really think of that encompasses all of these topics would be ‚Äúhumanities‚Äù or something idk. Maybe we can include that in a new name? 

And Idk if most of the new ager smooth brains know what that word even really means anyways so they would be less inclined to go there and rant nonsense

To designate all that to ‚Äúesoteric-spiritualist-talk‚Äù is almost insulting lol. It‚Äôs like some STEM positivist types saying those topics are pointless and no better than superstition.

Also, the term esoterica usually pertains to stuff like Magick and the occult, which I don‚Äôt think is really relevant. And spiritualism is literally the belief actual spirits and a spirit world. it‚Äôs not ‚Äúspirituality‚Äù (a word with no real meaning anyways hence quotes). Nor do I think the name really aligns with the objectives of the channel shown in the description. Honestly I think It‚Äôs quite a naive and even somewhat demeaning name which seems to come from STEM positivists types to whom these topics are pointless and identical with superstition.

This doesn‚Äôt really deal with low effort stuff tho. Only way I know to deal with that I think is to balance it with quality stuff. But as Nostalgico said, this is new territory and your going at this alone. It‚Äôs the same way trying to manage that channel. Thats what I think runs people off who are actually insightful and take this seriously


___

- mysticism has been co-opted by capitalism in order to nutrilize its revolutionary potential. It has been turned into a aesthetic Identity people can adopt so that they will buy things to make them appear as spiritual. Meditation has been turned into a means of instilling passivity 

___

- what made me approach college as a means of just getting a job was
- It‚Äôs not very fluid, and with choosing majors you have to think far in advance about what you might like to do, which is not viable because the further in the future you think, the less you can predict what events or thoughts may lead you to want to change course
- Learning takes place in the present, according to what you find important, meaningful, or interesting right now. It does not follow abstract, decontextualized, preplanned curriculums which you do not understand the importance of. With real learning there is no destination and no end point
- Therefor I think it‚Äôs best to not choose a major according to what ever you might find fulfilling, but for the sake of having a job

___

- prioritizing delayed gratification might be more important then renunciation. Working out might technically be unsatisfactory, but that shouldn‚Äôt be an excuse to just not do it cuz the short term consequences of that are worse than the long term consequences of actually doing it. Same for healthy eating, etc.

___

- When you feel like you can do something, you actually do it, of course. Then you are striving toward some goal, which gives you a sense of meaning

___

- People with ADHD don‚Äôt have a smaller working memory capacity. Their working memory is overwhelmed as they impulsively jump from one thought to the next
- People with ADHD don‚Äôt benefit from more organization that ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Lack of organization causes the symptoms. All people benefit from increasingly better organization. People with ADHD don‚Äôt practice organization at all. They switch tasks whenever they feel like it, rather than scheduling things or timing themselves. They place things down in random locations rather than putting it in some designated spot, etc. 

___

- What I‚Äôm starting to notice on the Cicada discord with people reflexive tendency to denounce the religious aspects or mock people who imply it also seems to have to do with perceived harm associated with those things. When they here ‚Äúenlightenment‚Äù or something, they think of crazy disfunctional new-agers who pompously claim enlightenment. Or they may think of the Inquisition, etc

___

- Nibbana is starting to sound unappealing. From how I understand it, it sounds like a state in which all operant conditioning triggers cease. The mind is unperturbed, unconditioned. Sure, you won‚Äôt experience cravings or aversion anymore. But to think of a state where you no longer get exited for certain things or have any passions doesn‚Äôt sound quite appealing to me

___

- I don‚Äôt think people should retreat into monasticism and follow strict rules like celebacy. I think you should engage in all such actions, however doing so mindfully. Therefor being able to see the unsatisfactory nature of these activities for oneself
- Another problem I have with rules in expectations in Buddhism is that they presented as a requirement for enlightenment, and enlightenment is the ultimate goal. Thus, if following such expectations does not bring someone happiness, they may feel like it‚Äôs them that is flawed, rather than the practice (for them). The goal should first and foremost be to increase happiness and decrease suffering. If compete renunciation doesn‚Äôt make you happy, don‚Äôt do it.

___

- When people lack control over their lives, they have less of a chance to establish meaning. They come to see themselves as at the whim of external forces, unable to direct anything themselves
- Autonomy goes hand in hand with meaning

___

- When you say Blake is the ‚Äúwokest,‚Äù 
- like wokescolding, where people will engage in callouts and guilting in order to demonstrate how woke they are, as this is a way to gain status in leftist spaces
- The hemogonizing aspect of the left I was referring to was purity testing and the filtering out of dissent 
- Then these hierarchies of wokeness are formed in leftist spaces, and it sounds like you could possibly be saying Blake would be at the top of one of those.
- As far as I understand it, this is literally the type of stuff The Marriage condemns. 

___

- I find most solutions for dealing with stress to be unsatisfactory and insufficient. I do not think we should protect our selves from stress or get away from it, I think we need to confront what stresses us head on and develop resilience to it
- Leftists I think over-rely on providing comfort to those under stress to the point where it terns into enabling, coddling, and fundamentalism even
- It‚Äôs ironic because revolution itself is extremely stressful. It will not give a fuck about your anxiety or depression. Revolution demands strength. It‚Äôs probably in the best interest of leftists to develop as much resilience as they can

___

- far leftists are a combination of not enough positive stimulation in childhood and also being overprotected
- Parents are too busy to to take care of their kids so they just keep them in the house and give them an iPad or something

___

- Default mode network daydreaming might be mostly left hemisphere based
- It‚Äôs disembodied
- It involves prediction and foxation
- our daydreams are mental simulations based on our conceptual understanding of the world

___

- When consensus develops in medicine, people come to believe that the current paradigm is healthy. Therefor, alternative perspectives must be unhealthy and harmful. This then becomes an excuse for censorship in order to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù people.
- This puts censorship in a seemly positive light

___

- maybe the primes are sacred because they can‚Äôt be divided by any other number but itself, much like god
- Or maybe because opposites cannot be decided without loosing their meaning, as they define each other

____

- I think people get mad when people find deeper meanings in the puzzle because they use it as a means of escapism
- the lit encourages them to experience discomfort by making us question our assumptions about the world we take comfort in, or my going against consensus

___

- I think impaired inhibition comes before default mode network activity in adhd. I think mind wandering becomes compulsive which strengthens the DMN
- Reactivity seems to be unconscious, and conscious attention seems to prevent it from occurring

___

- The left hemisphere is what is involved in reflexive responses and obsessions. [[Mindfulness]] utilizes the right hemisphere by allowing us to take a step back from that and see the bigger picture
- see [[The global attention of the right hemisphere precedes the narrow attention of the left hemisphere]], [[Novelty is handled by the right hemisphere, and is transferred to the left hemisphere as it becomes familiar]]

___

- It seems that with some leftists there never seems to be enough reperations. There can always be more. 
- it seems like some of these people care more about establishing dominion than equality. Or taht they want some sort of revenge

___

Here‚Äôs my reasoning so far btw if anyone‚Äôs interested. The MU puzzle in GEB was unsolvable, and the point was to posit 3 modes of cognition. The first is ‚ÄúI-mode‚Äù (intelligent mode). In I-mode, we are observant of our behavior and are able to ‚Äújump out of the system.‚Äù Jumping out of the system is our capacity to jump out of the task which were¬†performing, and survey what we have done. Wilson refers to these people in The New Inquisition as ‚Äúdomesticated primates, over the aeons, have not precisely evolved but have learned how to criticize and examine their own neurological programs. Members of this group cannot be mechanically predicted. They exhibit, at times at least, what looks like "growth" or "creativity,"

This is something a conventional machine is incapable of. Conventional machines follow M-mode (mechanical mode), which is when we are unobservant of behavior and cannot jump out of the system. In M-mode we can only operate strictly within the predetermined rules of a system, and we are willing to wait an infinite length of time for an answer. I think this is the kind of person Wilson refers to who are ‚Äúincapable of criticizing our own neural programs‚Ä¶ These mechanical programs are created trough the processes of imprinting and conditioning.‚Äù

The point of LP, however, may be to exhaust the intellect and bring us into Unmode, which is ‚Äúto silence perception, to silence logical, verbal, dualistic thinking.‚Äù This is the point of many koans as a lot of them are also unanswerable, I.e. ‚Äúthe sound of one hand clapping.‚Äù Similarly we have, per Wilson‚Äôs Prometheus Rising, ‚ÄúCabala, the most complicated ‚ÄúJewish joke‚Äù ever invented. Briefly, Cabala exhausts the third, semantic circuit by setting it to solve intractable numerological and verbal problems.‚Äù Koans being the ‚ÄúFar Eastern equivalent.‚Äù Could also explain why they gave us an absurd task like finding a deep web page. 

This program hosts through GitHub pages. Only thing I think you‚Äôd have to worry about is the domain name going out (if we used one)

___

- https://cakeordeathsite.wordpress.com/2017/05/04/the-sleep-of-reason/
- per puck at defcon: ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no deeper meaning in these images.‚Äù In other words, don‚Äôt bother looking we already know it‚Äôs meaningless
- Only the arrogance of a fundamentalist could speak with such authority

___

The background observing mind in mindfulness is the right hemisphere

___

People who do read the literature tend to just gloss it over and cannot assimilate it all quickly, so they just start making up random things for what they believe to be their core messages. These usually end up being vague corny psuedo-philosphical and self-help cliches or speak like ‚ÄúCicada wants us to purify our soul and find our true passion‚Äù or what not

___

People experience information overload because they try to get into topics in a top down way. If they want to read philosophy, they think they have to read all philosophy or follow some curriculum. Instead, they should read about things that articulate things they are already thinking or feeling. They shouldn‚Äôt force themsleves to read things they think they _should_ read. If they feel like what they‚Äôre reading is unimportant, they should move on to something else

___

- if mental illness is a normal reaction to a bad environment, then it is sensibility that is being diagnosed as illness. Normal is illness, and the average person is a neurotic mess, and this neuroticism is survival mechanisms. They simply do not see their detriment yet.

___

- Regulating speech is impossible. Hate speech is subjective, so it‚Äôs scope inevitably expands more and more as people seek to protect others better. Misinformation is illegitimate because certainty is impossible. To say one thing is misinformation is to implicitly imply that it‚Äôs contrary is objectively true. We therefor have no choice but to let platforms be free, otherwise it will always devolve into witch hunts.
- the Idea of misinformation is now being used to establish scientific dogma because people can invoke it arbitrarily. People can start calling misinfo when they want science to justify something
- medicine can start to become a way to control people because of how much it is intertwined with morality

___

- people try to integrate science into things in order to justify it
- Makes it seem like objective impersonal fact
- vegans are another example of this. It goes from being only a personal philosophy to being better for the environment, preventing disease, and that everybody should do it otherwise they‚Äôre harming humanity

___

- People think authority is necessary because they think that there is some fundemental irresponsibleness inherent within all people
- Original sin

___

- I‚Äôm skeptical that it‚Äôs necessary to avoid pleasure to secure out happiness. So the anticipation of the future and lamentation of the past can bring constant dissatisfaction, and being present makes us content. Idk if this implies renunciation. As long as you can schedule that activity, you can forget about it until then and stay in the present

___

On of the issues with the normal abnormal duality is that psychiatry only strives for normalcy and nothing beyond. I‚Äôm it‚Äôs attempts to fit in with the rest of medicine, psychiatry sees only a dichotomy between sickness and cure. If mental illness exists on a continuum, then psychiatry should take a virtue and vice approach to mental illness. I.e. there would be a spectrum between say, patience and impatience, and it would be beneficial to accumulate more and more patience over time. This way there is no reifying these traits between normal and as normal categories. If you can constantly develop these ‚Äúvirtues,‚Äù then you wouldn‚Äôt have to wait for diagnosis to consider it necessary to integrate these treatments into you life. It will always be beneficial

- mental disorders should be used as adjectives rather than nouns. I.e. you‚Äôre not a psychopath, but are being psychopathic, you don‚Äôt have ADHD, you are being ADHD, etc.
- I still think it‚Äôs useful to cluster certain traits into groups

___

- Equate your insights on psychiatry and the school system with misdiagnosis of learning disabilities
- https://theconversation.com/amp/intellectually-gifted-students-often-have-learning-disabilities-37276 learning disabilities in that they struggle to study things they‚Äôre not interested in but are deemed important by authority. They don‚Äôt have a learning disability, they‚Äôre are simply not interested in what you are teaching. But as far as you know that‚Äôs impossible because this is what children are supposed to learn, so the problem must therefor lie in them
- The bright are praised for succeeding well in conformity, the genius is condemned for non-conformity and making people question assumptions they take for granted
- Psychiatrist believe taht giftedness is so rare that it‚Äôs not worth considering, but they‚Äôre cannot tell when someone else is smarter than them due to dunning Kruger
- Write about the problems with iq tests I.e. motivation
- People are starting to see intelligence as a disability. It‚Äôs becoming more associated with autism

___

Slave morality in psychiatry:

- the resentment is toward those who are more capable of self control, better able to cope with adversity, etc
- The mentally ill have developed a means of absolving themselves from all responsibility and demands uncompromising sympathy
- the true world is supposed mechanistic ideal in which the brain is supposed to operate, which is supposed to be completely free of discomfort and pain. This is supposed to be achieved through perfecting brain chemistry, when in reality, psychiatric drugs only artificially increase neurotransmitter amounts which only numbs pain

___

- Nostalgico: ‚ÄúFunny enough I have Aphantasia so if I close my eyes I see nothing, only blankness and a pool of soundless thinking‚Äù
- this might fix it: https://akjournals.com/view/journals/2054/2/2/article-p74.xml
- I believe it has to do with how psychedelics allow separate brain areas to communicate that normally wouldn‚Äôt, I.e. the conscious frontal cortex with the occipital cortex, abrupting conscious perception with unconscious images
- i think default mode network might be overinhibiting these brain areas. Could be completely wrong tho lol

___

- The web archetype symbolizes non forcing. Each manifestation involves following the path of least resistance; mycelium finding food, matter following gravity to form the cosmic web, water forming cracks
- It also symbolizes interconnectedness

___

- true false logic assumes that things are either completely true or completely false
- It also cannot contend to two contrary things that are both true in different contexts

___

When we become too complacent in our views, we set ourselves up for future discomfort when our beliefs are refuted. We protect ourselves from this by always expecting that at any moment our entire worldview can be flipped upside down 

___

I still believe that the teachers who are naive of the harm they bring to children are still responsible for their actions as well as their lack of awareness. I think that those who ignore the harm they cause or at least the sense that harm is being done are especially deplorable

___
Parallels between slave morality and sombunall the left:

- Those leftists who advocate for equality do so from a place of resentment of those who are fairing better than them in society. It has nothing to do with freedom
- A subset of minority groups seem to demand an unreasonable amount of sympathy which to me indicates a desire to dominate under the pretext of support. I see this as an expression of the will to power through slave morality. They don‚Äôt really want genuine support, they want domination and revenge

----

I think having a single source of meaning can lead one to sort out the rest of their life so that they can pursue that purpose to the best of their abilities

___

- people can find meaning in their lives simply by pinpointing things they can improve about themselves

___

Things that contribute to misdiagnosis of gifted people:

- giftedness is rare which probably makes people much more likely to assume that their poor school performance is due to a learning disability
- our notion of being smart is so caught up with doing well in school that people assume that if you‚Äôd not do well you cannot possibly be to intelligent for it
- Intelligent people express ideas which to the ordinary person is hard to comprehend which could easily get misconstrued with mental disorder like schizophrenia

___

Can you explain the connection between blake and hegel? 

- The dialectic, from what i can gather, seems to have a lot to do with blakes "without contraries" doctrine
- dialectics as a metaphysical force
    - Supposedly blake believed it was the conflict between contraries that fueled the universe.
- And theirs a supposed consummation to this process in which spirit becomes self aware
    - Is this like blakes blulah? The realm where contriaries can both be considered true
    - Or the moment blake anticipates when the doors of perception are clensed, and we see the infinity within all? This is also what occurs when we access what wilson called meta-programming, where one becomes conscious of their brains unconscious programming

----
 
 How conventional religion breeds positivism and nihilism:

- Religion mistakes dispassion and restraint for repression
- unskillful action gets moralized
- religion begins to appeal to the lowest common denominator, myths become literalized
- people go too far with their revolt and take the complete oppiste stance
- nothing that is not empirically measurable is real or meaningful
- morality is thus thrown out the window
- people have no rules to order their lives around, no restraint, and everything devolves into unbridled hedonism

----

On the left, enabling and being overprotective is being taken as being progressive. They believe they are preventing harm and doing a moral good

----

- Once you decide who you are, you limit what you can become
- You will try to conform to that template from the top down 
- If you say you are a doctor, and you do something a doctor doesn‚Äôt do, you feel a conflict
- and you feel like your very identity is at risk
- It‚Äôs better to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm intrested in medicine‚Äù than ‚Äúi am a doctor‚Äù

___

I feel like learned helplessness is involved in depression in that it has less to do with people feeling lack of control itself, but the attitude that it brings. When one learns helplessness develops a nihilistic attitude toward life  "Life is just suffering without meaning, therefor, there's no use in trying. Whats the point."

----

Respond to puck: 

- "you can prove all of math without any philosophy"
    - What you don't realize is that the epistemic justification for all knowledge in math, science, and any other field has _philosophical grounds_. No, math cannot prove that math is true. That would be the job of philosophy. You're making philosophical claims and you don't even know it. 
- "I genuinely do not see any connection between being very smart and having philosophical knowledge""
    - To be an intelligent scientist you would have to understand this as well as the epistemic limits of science. There's many questions science just cannot answer but philosophy can, such as meaning, moral issues, interpretations of art, etc. You can only really develop a really shallow and limited understanding of the world by understanding it only through science
    - Every field is interconnected. That's why all the smartest people are polymaths
- "being smart means you know esoterica"
    - and again woo woo new age esoterica and philosophy are not the same thing. But as far as positivist types (like you seem to be, and the people who named this channel seem to be) understand it, it is, because they decide to just dismiss all ideas science cannot deal with as "meaningless," "irrational," "imaginary," etc. 

----

- stln: "What's left is an entire book of 55 pages which uses cryptography to encode a message..."
- Puck: "its made fun of because mostly cryptography has solved things"
- yeah and finding a key isn't really the point of reading the philosophy. It's to learn about the ideas. That's what makes it worth reading. If you want to learn that then It's not a waste of time. I wouldn't criticize people for looking into it or talking about it. The entire point doesn't have to be to just solve
- Not what this channel should even really be about anyways imo. I don't think people should read the references with the intention to solve. It should be more about bringing meaning to the puzzle. I hear people here say that "i don't believe in the esoteric approach" as if solving is the point of reading the philosophy
- If you think about it, how would philosophy solve the puzzle anyways? Of course its a cryptographic solution. That doesn't even make any sense. Seems like an convenient way for those that just don't like philosophy to discard it
- Im not saying you should care about it, what i have a problem with is you guys going around trying to denounce this stuff
- and considering you guys haven't really gotten anywhere thus far, then what isn't worth looking into at this point? There might be some kind of key there who knows. There's an entire side of the puzzle you guys are neglecting
- and don't tell me its too time consuming because The Marriage is like 30 pages, The Book of the Law like 30 as well, and Self-Reliance is literally an essay, not a book. Yall can at least start there
- But we got people digging through the 700 page Red Book which wasn't even referenced while ignoring the actual references lol

----

Problem with esoteric channel:

- out of context quotes
- making correlations between terms without attending to the whole message
- the fact that it doesn't make any sense does not mean it's because its just too wise or what ever
- The whole "you're just not ready to understand" thing is an easy excuse not to explain something and seem like you're smarter than you really are

___

Another thing image boards and forums have over social media is that the post that were boosted in the feed were the ones that generated discussion rather than likes. There was no upvote and down vote so repeated jokes, low effort comments, and the status quo would not shoot to the top. It encouraged you to read everything because the gems were hidden between the junk

___

Why the movements get ruined and gatekeeping happens:

- these people seem to be short sided and seek immediate gratification. They are not looking for something to find contentment in and develop a genuine passion for, they are looking for the next new exiting thing
- They‚Äôre looking for new identities. They are the people Johan peretti talks about who constantly have new shallow identities marketed to them. Marketers and the people them selves strip the movement of subtly and nuance that made it special in order to create comprehensible identity scripts

Why this bothers me:

- it makes genuine people hard to find. Genuine people become dispersed through the crowd and many are ran off. The movement gets overtaken by these kinds of people

___

- I think I‚Äôm starting to figure out what bothers me about some of the left. I notice this overprotective attitude that has speed thought the left, and these people are intent on preventing any and all harm, even if some kind of discomfort is necessary, i.e. self discipline. These is taken as virtuous and progressive because your supposedly helping people, but it‚Äôs often just enabling. 
- I think that things like woke scolding and purity testing is why big media is so tolerant of the left these days. Woke scolding and purity testing decide the left into isolated echo chambers and destroy cooperation.  
- They kick off right wingers from there platforms and act like they‚Äôre doing some progressive good and revive all this praise. But they really don‚Äôt care

___

- I do think mental illness categories are useful. I think the solution is to treat mental illnesses as adjectives rather than nouns. They are not something that you either have or don't have but a set of behaviors you exhibit to varying degrees. Everybody experiences many of the symptoms of mental illnesses to some degree. It exists on a spectrum, where you can have more or less of it. But there is no point where you can say conclusively that someone is eligible for diagnosis or not. I this way, rather then saying, "they _have_ adhd," you can say "that person is very adhd" or "oh im being very adhd lately." This describes their current state someone rather than defining who they are at their core
- This may also make it easier to relate to people acting in these ways.

----

- The idea of normality itself is a limiting concept
- Normality creates a baseline for people to meet and not move beyond without risking becoming "abnormal."
- for me theirs good traits and bad traits, and you can cultivate the good ones continuously and become an ever better person

To etherbunny:

- I don't think they would want to bother denouncing every instance of puzzle jacking. The best way to handle that would be just by saying "no pgp no cicada." By saying that you basically denounce all puzzle jackers
- And then, i wouldn't think they would handle that by saying "uh well were not a right wing group guys" cuz they probably dont want to feed that us vs them culture war bullshit.
- All im saying is its a bit to soon to go around telling people with such certainty that they are a right wing hate group or something
- If im being honest, the fact that your willing to interpret such ambiguous evidence as them being bigotted right wingers shows quite the in-group paranoia. Why are you so ready to set to set aliences
- ‚Äú3301 as a group seems to be against the 'woke left' when it comes to the concept of censorship. i'm speaking from an objective stand point, im not being critcal of 'woke leftists' i'm stating that 3301 imo would be against the censorship aspect of that group.‚Äù
    - [[You should follow your own morality even if it means the disapproval of society]]

- Can we rename this channel to like philosophy-mysticism or something like that? First, this puzzle does not seem overtly esoteric (as in: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_esotericism). Second, nothing really indicates that the puzzle has _anything_ to do with spiritualism (as in: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritualism).
- I think it more broadly involves just philosophy with a touch of general mystical philosophy (as in: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism) not specific to any tradition. And there isn't really anywhere appropriate to just talk about philosophy anyways. 
- I think I name change may also ward off some schizo types

Excitement can be good or bad. Individual expression, innovation, art, and certain kinds of sensuality add "spice" to life and make it exiting. Exitement is bad when we mistake it for happiness and begin to only persue cheap thrills

- We believe people are fundemantally irresponsible and that coercion is keeping the world from falling apart. When parents see their children engange in hedomism when they get home from school, they think the point is proven, but [[stress has been shown to be a major cause of continued drug dependence]] and [[anxiety and depression are linked to external locus of control]]. They are the reason why they do so

----

- Im noticing two justifications of censorship today. Misinfo and hatespeech
- Hate speech is ambiguous and up to interpertation. With enough mental gymnastics, anything can be considered hateful
- Misinformation implies that their is a right way of thinking about things. However, all current scientific knowlege has a chance of being proven wrong later. Nothing is ever certain in science. One thing we consider "misinformation" today may be proven by rigorous experiment tomorrow. If we censor everything that doesn't conform to the scientific paradigm of today as "misinformation", then scientific progress will hault.

Heres my solution to postmodern existerntial anxiety. The problem seems to be that people look externaly for meaning and identity. The postmodern enviroment is so choatic and decentralized that there is no common shared source of identity. Therefor, people seem to cling to whatever they can come across and form ingroups to make that identity feel more stable. I believe people need to stop looking externally for a prestructured identity and start looking within for that identity. People need to start asking themsleves what _they_ want, what _they_ care about, what _they_ could improve in their lives. They should let this guide their learning  and allow them to build an identity form the bottom up, rather than top down.

Around late high school, i began to struggle with an interrnal conflict. I was becoming less and less intrested in socializing not out of mental distress but because i simply felt my peers to be unintresting. But, at the same time, i struggled with solitude.

At a certain point, i remember asking myself something like "Wouldn't i be happier if i gave up the persuit for validaton and put that time into things i care about?" From which i concluded yes. I then started to wonder why if i didn't care about these people, then why did i want to be friends with them in the first place? Why did i struggle with soliltude so much if I found myself to be the person i enjoyed being around the most. I realised i had a problem that was actually infringing upon my quality of life and i would be better off if i learned how to get over it.

I tried to look into the issue to realize that nobody was really talking about the matter. Everyone was just perpetuating the unquestioned dogma that "humans are social creatures." All i could find were charizma youtubers teilling you how to improve your body language

I dont think many people seem to come to this conclusion. Most tend to adhere to the unquestioned dogma that we are "social creatures" and that solitude "causes" mental illness. I believe this to maybe be what is behind the incel phenomena. These people seem to genuinely believe that they're being robbed of some fundemental need. They try all the shitty youtube charisma tips which are said to work rather than developing an authentic personality that would make them someone worth being around, and when they don't work, they start blaming other people and take it out on them.

The internet has been structured in a way to divide people and prevent them from organizing effectively. Algorithms isolate people into individual isolated groups who do not interact with each other

----

- Mental illness should be treated as a verb, not a noun
- Its not who you are, its what you do
- We should stop talking about mental illness as something you possess and instead as something you qualify for
- Most mental illnesses involve behaviors that we all experience. It becomes difficult to dicide who "has" a mental illness and who doesn't
- Mental illness categories should not go away, but we need to recognize the ambiguity of what determines when someone should be diagnosed or not. We should recognize these behaviors to be on a spectrum
- I think we should be aware of these behaviors and when we see someone acting that way we should be prepared to handle them effectively

Something im noticing about the whole remidial class thing is this condensending attitude from teachers that they know what is necessary for a child to know. Thus, if that child is disingaged for what ever reason, these teachers never seem to blame the enviroment. They always find a way to blame the individual. This is always put in this frame that theyre helping people accomplish what is necessary for them. Basiacally I feel like these diagnoses tend to be rationalizations

----

Another problem I have with mental illness is that sense they usually involve behaviors that everyone exerpeonces, anyone can adopt the label

----

Its a learning disability when you cant get them to want to learn what _you_ think is important to them. Its attention deficit when you cant get them to pay attention to what _you_ think is important to pay attention to

The standardization of behavior and emotion by psychiatry may also have to to with left hemispheric disgust with the body

----

- Learning should be a step by step process which is guided by your intrest. The questions you have on one idea, book, course, etc., should lead you to the next. You shouldnt know where you are leading yourself, as you would with a predetermined structure. Overtime, you find that you have developed a wealth of knowledge on a variety of subjects. Learning should be bottom up, not top down. You shouldnt have to choose what subject youll major in or whatever years in advance. 
- we dont do this because we dont trust our children are capable of learing whats important
- Learning should also be contextual. You should learn things based on the fact that you know it is important to your life. Context is what insentivises people to learn about something

----

I think you see narrow reductionism in pharmacology so much because pharma often offers simple solutions, i.e. a single chemical compound to combat a single pathology

What i dont like about the idea of a metaphysical creator God is that apects or ideas can be attributed to this God so that they can claim it to be an inherent aspect of the universe. This has been used to justify all sorts of attrocities.

Depression po feeling lack of control po repetitive response styles po default mode network po [[Our left hemisphere unconsciously focuses on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]] po [[The more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world]]

This is why people with depression will have a persistent fatalistic attitude or adopt fatalistic philosophies even after the things that they really didn't have control over went away

I think that capitalism is perpetuated mostly through disgust and paranoia towards others. People think that everyone is fundamentally irresponsible and must be coerced into doing things, other wise society will spiral into chaos. They are also afriad that people will steal all there stuff. People think these things are a product of capitalism, but I think this mindset was a cause of capitalism

----

I argue that using extrinsic reward and punishment to motivate people to work makes them _more_ lazy because they do not know why they are doing what they are doing or do not even for the direct benefit they bring to society. They will only want to do what ever necessary to get the paycheck

----

- Things like money and debt make the world more mechanistic and apethetic. You no longer help people spontanuosly because it feels intrisically good, but you do it in hope of some reward and evaluate what that will cost you, or wether you will make a profit or loss form it. Every action becomes quantified and profit oriented
- WIth debt systems, not only to you have to quantify your actions, but that quantity is kept track of and you inevitablly have to pay it. debt will build up to an absurd degree. Without debt tracking, we would eventually consider this absurd and just forgive people

___

- I did a lot of looking about that. There is a common god which depending on source emerge from Chaos or after Chaos and a cosmic egg. That being would then create the other gods and eventually die whether to build the earth and man or because a younger god usurp their power. Like Zeus usurping Phanes, Odin killing Ymir, and Horus trying to usurp Ra. Then again the usurpers can be consider a demiurge because like Yaldaboath, he's not the true creator in a sense.
- The emissary usurping the master

School was so depressing for me because I actually had personal intrests and school robbed me of my time with those things and replaced it with a bunch of out of context activities that had no revelance to my life. No one else seems to actually have personal intrests. They're were solely concerned with how others perceived them, so praise from teachers made do

----

- we essentialism the mental illness first and then come up with a theory afterwords to justify that claim. They're looking for evidence for something they already believe
- Since we have already assumed that a mental illness is permanent
- We have a hard time imagining that a mental illness and say, stress, can involve the same neural mechanisms
- It causes a lot of confusion with understanding how the brain responds to the environment. We act as if these are entirely separate phenomena
- This may also be why people who were diagnosed with adhd persist in saying that they have it even if they excel in activities requiring attention and disclose compared to their peers

Seeking or appreciating novelty, such as in creative activities, isn't harmful in and of itself. It's harmful when it is compulsive and you are dependant on it. If you are content with you're life, that compulsive desire goes away. This can actually improve you're creativity I think because it's no longer forced

- Do you think science or mathematics is going to answer moral questions? Can it answer questions such as "what is the meaning to life"? Can you measure the quality of, say, a poem? No, because that is outside of the scope of those feilds. You need other models to be able to understand and discuss these things.
- science or math without philosophy devolves into dogma 
- You have to be a polymath to have a solid understanding of the world. You cannot understand it adequaly through one narrow lens. Or as blake would call it "single visioh" and "newtons sleep"
- Only reason i care to rant about this is because this is literally the shit that the literature refrences talk about. You guys dont read it because you are either afraid that it will make you question your confident assumptions about the world, or your extremely arrogant in your beliefs as to the scope of what is possible and have dismissed the stuff already
- Its just dissapointing to see these people put all this effort into a puzzle for pretty much everybody to completely miss the point. Next to no one has talked about the content within the literature

Can you clarify what you mean by "esoteric approach?"

Is the creativity and openmindedness that the literature advocates "esoteric?"

So what do you believe in then? The mechanistic approach? Do you think, after all these years, that it still must be some singular preestablished decryption method, or some algo that a robot can solve, or‚Äîwhen your frustrated‚ÄîBrute Forcing?

Perhaps there is no cheat sheet or algo. Maybe this is only something a human can solve. The literature would definitely indicate that. Maybe we need to recognize the absurdity of this approach and "jump out of the system" as Hostader would say, something a robot who lacks the capability for self awareness is incapable of.

Schools only ensure that you will succeed in a society because they expose you to sociatal norms and nothing else. If children didnt go to school, they wouldnt succeed in society because they would have been exposed to another way of life and would see society as unjust

----

- most peoples social confidence stems from the fact that they just succeed in the socialing game. Not because they arent afraid of people leaving them, which can only come from the capacity to enjoy solitude
- Their advice tends to be "just talk to people" 

___

- I don't think people will ever be satisfied to the degree that they silence harmful ideas. There will always be something else harmful to silence. When they succefully nutralize one viewpoint, there will be something else to censor. I think that censorship mentality has an underlying expectation for perfection. People need to realize that perfection just isn't real. Discomfort is an inherent aspect of existence. If reality was perfect nothing would exist and everything would just be static. It's the imperfect nature of reality that gives way to movement and makes reality possible
- Leftist need to realize that ALL censorship is dependent on effective surveillance. I'm order to effectively shut out certain views you need to make sure no one can get away with saying them. 
- Censorship is reliant on tyranny of majority. You need to get enough people to believe in something fervently enough to justify silencing contrary views. Tyranny of majority is just another heigerachy, thus censorship is anti anarchy
- Censorship is facism because facists always need a new enemy to nutrilize in order to protect society

___

I think compete renunciation is misguided. It was probably a product if it's time because it was a way out of the cast system. I don't think it's pleasure itself that's problematic, I think the problem lies in peoples relationship with pleasure. I think pleasure only becomes a problem when people develop a sort of dependency on it and either cannot be separated from it in fear of losing it or hoard in fear of losing it 

___

- Extrinsic rewards interferes with the process in which people are able to acknowledge the intrinsic rewards of an activity. This is why people become disconnected with their labor. They're not doing it for it's own sake.
- It is the same for punishment. Extrinsic punishment interfears with one's ability to connect their actions with its consequences. Thus they never truly learn why the action is wrong but only has an abstract idea fed to them by their society as to why that is the case. The desire is never actually eliminated
- I believe that in an Anarchist society, people overtime will become more connected with the inherent value of their labor. It may start off bumpy. People may maintain their greedy or lazy habits from the previous system. But they will eventually learn the consequences of their actions and will abandon them. No coercion necessary 
- It's because of this that I believe cocerion took hold primarily because someone else _wanted_ to impose their reality onto everyone else. They cannot realize this fact because of this desire. The tyrant believes they are certain of what's right for humanity and that experience cannot teach the people 
- What is the root of higherarchy if not distrust and paranoia? The tyrant believes that they must take responsibility for everyone else otherwise society will fall into disarray, and that they cannot trust society to figure things out for themselves

___

I think that minimalism is a smarter appraoch than complete renunciation because the problem is not that we have anything at all, its that we collect more than what we need through ignorance. It not indulgence itself thats the problem, its our reliance on it. The household life is not a means of comfort and fear, but utility. If it wasnt for it, we would still be living in caves and fighting for our lives day by day and their wouldnt be any buddhism.

___

What makes relationships satifying is the bond that is built. When people make thier entire personality revolve around the relationships themselves, they have no intrests. Thus, they will have no basis from which to bond from. Thats why i find the whole idea of relationships themsleves being a source of fulfilment strange. I always find that these people have weird perceptions as to why a relationships is valueable. For example, qouting from a website "mutual respect, trust, and loyalty," as if these things have vaue in and of themselves without context.

----

- The idealization of relationships leads people to make it thier sole source of meaning. When people make liking others their entire personality, they have nothing real to offer and are in relationships for their own sake. Not because they like the other persons personality

----

- When we place social value on popularity, people base their self worth into that
- Those who do succeed in the friendship game have a higher self esteem and thus struggle to understand why those who have trouble succeeding get so upset. They can't relate to them. That's where I think advice like "just talk to people" comes from

___

- One thing about Buddhism is this idea that industrial society and technology is rooted in craving for comfort. If it wasn't for technology, household life, etc., we would still be in the wild fighting for our lives all day and their would be no time for Buddhism

The only reason many mental illnesses exist is because we live in a social context in which such ideas would only be necessary in. I believe that if capitalism were abolished, there would be no need to even diagnose the majority of mental illnesses.

---

- Students are forced to be at school, thus teachers have to figure out ways to deal with kids they find difficult. Kids therefor are far more likely to be misdiagnosed with mental illnesses. This does not happen in the workplace because your boss can just fire you
- This is why i believe mental illness is so often discussed in the context of children
- like isnt there this whole idea that adhd is overlooked in adults or somehing?

----

Productivity guilt occurs because people feel like they _should_  be doing something. It has to do so with nearing expectations. They are not doing that thing because they _want_ to do it. If you only do things that you enjoy then you wouldn't be enclosed to procrastinate in the first place

___

I don't think it's necessary for an adult to direct ones education. I believe that child can figure out what's important to learn simply by participating with the real world. They will learn what is necessary to succeed and will not have to bother with irrelevant topics. School takes you out of the real world completely and feeds you a bunch in non-contextual information

___

- When people can't orient their own sense of purpose, they tend to look for other people to provide that sense of purpose for them.
- Self worth is a delusion. It only applies in a social context. You can only determine your "worth" in comparison to others or in dependence upon someone else's opinion. Those who try to validate themselves do so because they still believe they must be worthy of something or someone. Self esteem is only something you must be manipulated into believing is valid. You were not born for anyone but yourself. You do not owe anybody anything. The only way to get over that delusion is to act like it isn't true.

___

Spirituality these days being appropriated into a persona to sell these days. It's similar to punk. Punk used to have meaning. It represented anarchism and revolution. When record labels got a hold of it, it was stripped of its anti-capitalist sentiments and what was left was tight jeans, leather jackets, and dyed hair. That's what it meant to be punk. Similarly, what it means to be spiritual these days is to own a bunch of Buddha statues, do yoga, condem the "ego," use buzzwords like peace, love, happiness etc., affirmations, and so on.

___

Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.

Autism diagnosis bother me because the autism label has a powerful influence on how people persove you. When people here about your diagnosis, they going to perceive you through that lenses dn will pay extra attention to any quirks or awkward moments and use that to justify the label.

Since autism is a spectrum, you can keep reducing that percentage point and yet still be stuck with the same label that someone on the other end of the spectrum who can't speak holds. I can't tell you how many times I've been told who's it may just be very mild or whatever. In this way, you can't never 

This labels are stigmatizing in the sense that people can dismis any points that you make much more reality as delusions

___

- One of the big things I realized was that I was so focused on sharing my experiences with others that I put little attention towards my own self development. I made my identity revolve around that. I think this is one of the reasons people get stuck in this lifestyle, it becomes their purpose in life. Without it they feel empty. 

___

- Just because you support free speech doesn't mean you support the ideas themselves. People really seem to struggle with this.
- If the majority of people do not take a persons views seriously, then that persons desired policies simply don't get implemented. I feel like censorship is rooted in a subtle fear that the vulnerability of a society, or a lack of confidence in taht society. If that's the case, then maybe you should question the integrity of the peoples support for that society, not just blame the person. If they are that easily deterred, then maybe they didn't believe in such a society enough in the first place. I don't think the answer is to just shun that person away from society to keep their views from being heard. All you can do is fight hate speech by spreading truth. What side people take is not under your control.

___

My take a very step by step approach to my life.

I dread college because as far as I understand it, it's very antithetical to this. It's as contrived as you get. When you choose a major, your basically choosing everything you going to learn about years in advance. And in the process your going to learn about many things you don't care about. You really can't seem to take this self directed freestyle approach

___

Psychiatry as a form of social control and stigmatization is pretty obvious in my circumstances imo. I was never considered mentally ill until I started school. And I was forced to go. It was a matter of me just leaving if we didn't like each other. They had to figure out _something_ in order to impose those extra rules into me. I can't help but wonder if I would have ever been diagnosed with anything if I never went to school. 

___

Idk why I'm just starting to notice it now. But school made me compulsively defensive . All those years of having to defend myself against punishment that I literally couldn't walk away from. Everytime I encounter someone who disagrees with me, I return back to that same headspace and seem to treat it like I'm gonna have to defense myself by some omnipotent authority. If you have to rely on Intuition, you don't have to explain that to anyone. Remember dude, you no longer have to justify your actions to anyone anymore.

___

- in order to preserve there position of authority, authority figures have to convince the populace that they need them in order to keep society from falling into chaos. That they cannot order themselves but need experts to direct their 

----

- in considering that [[Genensis can represent our intellect creating a model out of the formless void of experience]], God must represent the process that creates order out of chaos i.e. like in chaos theory. 
- God = left hemisphere
- Formless void / creative void: right hemisphere

___

Quoting or mentioning people when discussing an idea is generally pointless because it doesnt make the idea any more valid. It usually comes off as if youre mentioning someone in order to make the idea seem more credible. Its best to discuss the idea itself when teaching someone.

-----

- I believe the reason why people that are inclined to religious fervor gravitate towards illusive concepts such as "ego" is bevause they seem to imagine that they dont understand these concpets not because theyre actually incoherent but because theyre just so sublime that theyre difficult to comprehend. 
- I notice a lot of cult leader type people talk a like this to make it seem like theyre smarter that theyre actually are and that you "just dont get it maaan." 

----

Pseudoscience has turned into a word to refer to anything that cannot be empiracly proven. This  of course comes from people who believe that only things that can be empirically proven are real. 

___

You should constantly be learning and reading in your life because even if that reading only affirms the views you already hold, you'll at least know the other sides perspective and how to argue against it. 

There is no "complete gnosis," "supreme unsurpassed enlightenment," "knowthing left to be done." There is always something new to learn and improve

___

- renunciation is not the answer. It's appreciation. You must learn how to become content with what you have and learn how to appreciate it instead of just seeking more
- As well as the ability to withstand pain or deprivation 
- I'm starting to not think that any gratification leads to unfulfilment, that's only if someone is emotionally immature.
- renunciation is not the answer, it is contentment. Contentment leads to natural renunciation because one who's content doesnt overconsume.
- Its not pleasure thats "bad." What the bad part is you're attitude towards pleasures. You can still partake the joys of life, such as music, art, comedy, etc. It only becomes problematic when dependence and attachment is involved. Contentment means that we can resist urges when necessary because we are not dependent on them. Buddhism is a tool for learning how to handle your emotions better and to develop a healthier relationship with pleasure.
- The buddhist framework is extremely useful, but i feel that it should probably be reoriented towards emotional regulation rather than complete renunciation
- I think to reduce things like music and art to just sensual pleasure is very niave. That may be easy for someone who doesn't care much for music to say. I belive theres different levels of pleasures. Art and, say, junkfood are not on the same level. There is so much more depth to something like art.
- theres nothing wrong with asceticism per say. But i dont think i believe that its some sort of ideal lifestyle as buddhism seems to proport. Sure, it may work for some people, but i dont believe any lifestyle is the perfect one. Pationate hobbies such as art and music that bting immense joy and meaning to many peoples lives without them having some sort of toxic relationship with them. If a hobby brings happiness to your life, then keep it up. Its only a problem when it brings suffering
- Complete renunciation should be something you _want_ to do before taking it up, not an obligation. If you dont feel like becoming an ascetic, then you shouldnt. If a renunciate takes delight in something, he shouldnt feel guilty about it. I feel much better about myself when accepting the fact that i dont want to be an arahant.
- If you dont want to renunciate, thats ok. The notion may bring you more suffering than accepting yourself would.

Righteousness = self importance
Genuine kindness = selfless

___

- Spiritual practice doesn't legitimize oppression
- Spiritual practice teaches us how to deal with inevitable stresses better
- The thing about oppression is that it is unnatural stress. It is stress that we shouldn't have to deal with. Any stress that is unecessary should be mitigated. 

___

I feel like there's a fundamental difference here between me and others. I imagine what's happening here is the fact that other people are able to withstand uncomfortable situstions better without getting overwhelmed by cravings. I think the real problem here is not that I'm addicted to pleasure. Is more that I'm excessively adversed to pain. I feel like my aversion signals in my brain are on overdrive. And this can definitely be the result of a stressful childhood when my limbic system was still growing

___

- the two hemispheres differ primarily in how they pay attention to things
- Flow state indicates hemispheric synchronization
- This means that both kinds of attention are in balance which puts James clears "Goldilocks" attention idea into perspective
- If we want to experience flow state more often in our lives, we need to figure out how to orient our lives in ways that utilize both hemispheres

___

Being that the school system serves as a filtering system, attempting to produce as many people at the same safe level as possible, this shows that the school system does have a mechanistic conception as to how a person should operate. Those who don't meet these expectations are considered to have something wrong with them. 

Deviating behaviors are moralized

____

Within the nobel eightfold path, moral disipline helps with behavior regulation, concentration developes attention, and the wisdom group ancourages long term thinking and patience while discouraging impulsivity.

----

Hiegherarchy and centralization contribute to the mechanistic ideal. The more centralized things are, the more people and things that centralized power must manage. This is obviously not possible so they end up having to concieve some sort of ideal indivudual and establish a ton of rules to get poeple to follow and meet those standards.

----

The world is so fast paced today that psychaitrists have no choice but to rely on checklists

----

Maybe the reason why some people do not become addicted is because they think longer term and dont have such an intense reaction to stress 

----

To overcome craving for short term gratification, one has to limit there use of short term gratifying things or give them up all together. If you keep giving into your urges, you strengthen the neural pathways associated with that behavior and perpetuate the habit.

___

Nihilism -> dispair and hedonism -> addiction -> cortisol (stress) and dopamine (craving) suppress serotonin -> adhd and depression 

___

- norepinephrine insentivises to move
- Piti May involve norepinephrine
- The first jhana involves thought and examination and includes piti born of seclusion. In my experience "thought and examination" refers to the flood of thoughts and mind wandering that occurs during 
- Mind wandering is an evolutionary trait that serves the function of keeping us alert and expecting potetntial danger 
- Maybe the first jhana is a reaction to sitting still and the kind freaking out expecting danger
- I think that as the jhana s progress, the body calms down realizing that it is safe

___

I think it's possible that people with adhd get the same dopamine rush that everyone else has, hence the lack of evidence for a chemical embalance, but instead do actually have a underdeveloped prefrontal cortex. In the context of neuroplastcity, these means that sort of the brain isn't being utilized enough. Thus , an ordinary dopamine rush wouldeffect more of a smaller prefrontal cortex and craving would be more overwhelming for such people

___

- People want to feel oppressed in order to gain sympathy and benefits. Thats why you see so many people self diagnosing themselves with mental conditions, switching genders, or creating genders in order to manufactire a reason to gain sympathy. They're preying on people who truly want to help people. There is real oppression out there and the battle against real oppression is being hijacked by fake leftists who simply just want people to feel bad for them. This makes the people who are actually in shitty situations not be taken as seriously

----

Eternal damnation is samsara

Nibbana is also referred to as immortality and the deathless

___

- I think the Bible has a lot to do with kundalini and stuff like that.
- Jesus died at 33 and there‚Äôs 33 bones in the spine
- Adam and Eve may be the left and right brain hemispheres. And the serpent the lower brain. this is reflected in Egyptian symbolism a lot too with the eye of Horus supposedly
- The first sin was identity view, which is rooted in craving, and which is where all ‚Äòsin‚Äô derives

I think it is rigidity that is the cause of mental illness. In behavior ie habits or in perceptions. 

during my mushroom trip my rigid perceptions dissolved that the world started to recreated itself and present itself in a new light. And these new perspectives brought immense peace and joy 

I think adhd may be characterized by stubborn rigid habits. While depression and anxiety can be characterized by stubborn perceptions. Specifically a fixation on the negative aspects of experience.

Neuroplasticity can be summed up by hebbs law ‚Äúneurons that fire together wire together.‚Äù So the more you perform a behavior, the more strength you give with neurologically and the harder it is to fight. Conversely, if you abstain from an action, the neurons associated with it eventually die off. So when you meditate, you are repeatedly redirecting your focus from feelings mind wandering back to your breath. As you repeat this action, the easier it gets and the less influence your emotions and thoughts have in your.

As long as you give I. To your intrusive thoughts. You give your impulsivity strength. And the stronger the urge will be to give in.

- so the default mode network is responsible for self referential thinking. Mindfulness shuts off the default mode network. When the default mode network is shut off you enter a state of ‚Äúflow.‚Äù The jhana s are basically successive stages of flow. When ever you think of the jhanas in self referential terms, ie ‚ÄúI‚Äôve entered the first jhana‚Äù you immediately leave the jhanas. This implies that the feeling of self is a product of craving
- When they speak of observing your thoughts and feelings no judge mentally, it really means non self referentially
- Maybe nibbana is like a perpetual state of flow

___

Through insight, you start to see that the things you once thought were rewarding actually bring pain, so you see reward in avoiding what you previously thought was rewarding. As insight culminates, you start to see the unsatisfactory nature of all things, and thus you start to see reward everywhere, I believe that at this point ones reward pathways are in a perpetual state of functioning 

Rather than eliminating of craving destroying motivation, it instead creates a perpetual state of motivation I.e. over coming defilements, mastering virtues, etc.

Intrusive thoughts that appear in ones mind during stress usually have to do with a type of escapism by imagining themselves in more pleasant situations and diverting there attention from the unpleasant experience. This seems to be why mindwandering goes crazy when under stress

Also I‚Äôve noticed that wondering thoughts always seem to have some sort of lust or aversion attached to them, the constituents of craving, which drive one to act according to said thought.

___

After meditating, I initially notice that after the first few seconds, the external environment is sort of an incoherent blurb, which in three or four seconds it starts to morph and reconstruct itself and becomes coherent, which is always a weird experience. But there‚Äôs still this sort of rebooting that takes a couple minutes or so. As my brain ‚Äúreboots,‚Äù I notice that I‚Äôm in this state where I don‚Äôt immediately l try to
classify and define my environment. I‚Äôm just very present and in this equanimous non-judgmental state. After a few minutes, I notice that my brain starts to distinguish and discriminate between everything again, my internal dialogue starts to kick in and and back into craving and clinging mode.

- ‚ÄúThe word kamma translates literally to "action", but it specifically refers to volitional action, As [[The Buddha]] says: ‚ÄúIt is volition that I call kamma; for having willed, one acts by body, speech, and mind.‚Äù Kamma thus denotes that deeds originate from volition.‚Äú

- Kamma = voluntary nervous system

- Karmic seeds = habitual tendencies

- basal ganglia = habit formation, reward based learning learning, voluntary motor function

- volitional actions are the ones that form habits

- nucleus accumbens = ‚Äúthe reward center‚Äù, processes motivation, aversion, and reward, produces reward chemicals like dopamine

- dopamine: associated with craving, reward, motivation, etc

- [[mind]] = [[Volitional formation]], [[Consciousness]], central nervous system nervous system

- first five of [[Six sense bases]] = peripheral nervous system


- ‚ÄúImpelled by attachments we engange in [[kamma]] pregnant with (10) a new existsance.‚Äù 
- ‚Äú‚ÄúMonks, what one intends and what one plans and whatever one has a tendency toward: this becomes a basis for the continuance of consciousness.‚Äù 
- ‚Äú‚Äúconsciousness can jump from one body to another (this is compared to how a spark from a hot iron can travel through the air in¬†[AN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E1%B9%85guttara_Nik%C4%81ya "A·πÖguttara NikƒÅya")¬†7.52).‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIn what are called ‚Äúout of body experiences‚Äù (OOBEs) by parapsychologists, awareness seems to escape the confines of the nervous system entirely.‚Äù 
- ‚ÄúWe prefer to say, in accord with earlier writings of Timothy Leary and the present author and the speculations of the Physics/Consciousness Research Group in San Francisco that such cases illustrate a special working of what is called in quantum mechanics Bell‚Äôs Theorem.‚Äù

- habits po OOBEs po quantum entanglement po rebirth?

- ‚ÄúThe eighth consciousness,¬†_ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna_¬†(storehouse or repository consciousness), was defined as the storehouse of all karmic seeds, where they gradually matured until ripe, at which point they manifested as karmic consequences.‚Äú,
- ‚ÄúThe¬†_ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna_¬†is also what experiences¬†[rebirth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Buddhism) "Rebirth (Buddhism)")¬†into future lives and what descents into the womb to appropriate the fetal material. Therefore, the¬†_ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna's_¬†holding on to the body's sense faculties and "profuse imaginings" (_[prapa√±ca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_proliferation "Conceptual proliferation")_) are the two appropriations which make up the "kindling" or "fuel" (lit.¬†_[upƒÅdƒÅna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up%C4%81d%C4%81na "UpƒÅdƒÅna")_) that¬†[samsaric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra "Sa·πÉsƒÅra")¬†existence depends upon.‚Äù 
- ‚ÄúThe personal consciousness contains forgotten memories, repressed memories, or anything the person is not consciously aware of at that moment (habits, kammic seeds)‚Äù
- The collective unconscious however is much more powerful and deeper and is shared by all human beings. There are many theories as to how we came to share the collective unconscious. Perhaps it is held in the human dna or transmitted by some other means (mine: past lives)‚Äù
- ¬†Some modern Buddhists authors like¬†[K.N. Jayatilleke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._N._Jayatilleke "K. N. Jayatilleke")¬†also argue that the Buddha's main argument in favor of rebirth was based on empirical grounds, and that this included the idea that¬†[extra-sensory perception](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasensory_perception "Extrasensory perception")¬†(Pali:¬†_atikkanta-manusaka_) can provide a validation for rebirth ... Modern Buddhists such as Bhikkhu AnƒÅlayo and Jayatilleke have also argued that rebirth may be empirically verifiable and have pointed to certain parapsychological phenomena as possible evidence, mainly¬†[near-death experiences](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_experience "Near-death experience")¬†(NDEs),¬†[past-life regression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past-life_regression "Past-life regression"),¬†[reincarnation research](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation_research "Reincarnation research")¬†and¬†[xenoglossy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoglossy "Xenoglossy").
-  ‚ÄúWith neurogenetic consciousness, these DNA archives become accessible to brain scanning, while awake. (They are always accessible, as archetypes of the Jungian ‚Äúcollective unconscious,‚Äù during dreaming sleep.) The first to achieve neurogenetic awareness, a few thousand years ago, spoke of ‚Äúmemories of past lives,‚Äù ‚Äúre-incarnation,‚Äù‚Äúimmortality,‚Äù etc.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThis archetypal circuit is replete with what Jung called synchronicities ‚Äî meaningful coincidences ‚Äî which he attributed to the circuit‚Äôs roots in what he called the ‚Äúpsychoid‚Äù level, below the personal and collective unconscious, where ‚Äúmind‚Äù and "matter‚Äù are not yet differentiated‚Äù

- ‚Äúconsciousness ([_vi√±√±ana_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vij%C3%B1%C4%81na "Vij√±ƒÅna")) is seen as supported by the body and its cognitive apparatus and cannot exist without it (and vice versa)‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAs described above in the discussion of mental fabrications' conditioning of consciousness, past intentional actions establish a¬†[karmic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism "Karma in Buddhism")¬†seed within consciousness that expresses itself in the future. Through consciousness's "life force" aspect, these future expressions are not only within a single lifespan but propel karmic impulses (_kammavega_) across¬†[samsaric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsara "Samsara")¬†[rebirths](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Buddhism) "Rebirth (Buddhism)").‚Äù
- Uberboyo on stargate project: ‚Äúthere‚Äôs all this electricity in your body, this is what your life is ... when you die that electricity leaves your body ... you return to the realm of matter, or so you think ... this electricity is energy and this energy cannot be created or destroyed ... what happens is that electricity leaves you and everybody might say he‚Äôs dead his soul has left him ... what is this electricity? What does it do? ... when it renters our body it animates us

Modern psychology characterizes people by top down characteristics and places a label on the person while ignoring underlying motives that we all share, and thus have little sympathy for the person diagnosed
