### Theories

- Audio for instar emergence is not meant to reveal who these people might be, but revealing the histroical context 3301 came out of can support my thesis. 
- SadowickProduction: "frequency peak that is a little bit above a 15k" "this frequency is consistent throughout the entire track this right" "it's noise from CRT monitors" "this will date the recording to that time period but I'll take it a step further so we were using I guess CRTs from you know 80s all the way up until 2000"  "I believe that this composition was originally recorded on to tape because there is a there is a cassette tape warble near the end" "it doesn't occur in the digital realm this is with tape and that's how people used to record music onto tape so that will date it back a little bit further I have the general theory that this was recorded in the 70s because of the popular usage of tapes reverse effects which I'll show you and you know all the things that were popular in the 70s that was then transferred on to cassette tape right and then it was archived from cassette to computer with the CRT sometime in the 90s" "because it is at 192 kilobits per second so it's not 320 so we have to kind of go into the mind of who kind of made this it's we're looking at kind of how expensive hard drive space was back then so a lot of the songs you know late 90s they you know this was like high fidelity 192 is essentially CD quality so that's why it's at 192 also a lot of I guess like recording software from like the input jack or whatever whatever was going on its maximum the bit rate would be 192" "the ax right it says 59 all right that is that is continuous it's not a harmonic related to anything else it is continuous so what does that tell us that is a a frequency very close to 60 and I think there's there's some there's some you know we have to take into account you know tape speed and stuff like that could be faster it could be slower who knows what's going on calibration all have fun stuff but that is 60 Hertz and that tells me that this was recorded in North America because of the mains frequency that is coming out of the wall not in Europe" "student young person the the guitar is kind of kind of spotty" "it lacks like rhythm cohesion but it does sound pretty cool I'm thinking this was recorded with just one person kind of music nerd someone in kind of college I guess and I say that because there's speculation that the group's origins from California and is from I guess the kind of emergence of the internet does sound pretty cool I'm thinking this was recorded with just one person kind of music nerd someone in kind of college I guess and I say that because there's speculation that the group's origins from California and is from I guess the kind of emergence of the internet" "which would coincide with you know someone from that generation being into this music kind of starting this group on the in in California and this was kind of their music and they included it"
- There have been early records discovered in 1993 to 1994 relating to a series of mailing distributions created by Berkeley staff who worked in Soda Hall. One of them was Eric Hughes, who was a mathematician in 1993 at Berkeley who was involved in working on making the distros encrypted and anonymous. What is funny is that the distro domains had cicada written into it. (cicada.berkeley.edu).
- Eric Hughes was well know in the cypherpunk community who wrote books on cryptology. He was also associated with John Gilmore, who is a huge advocate against Internet censorship and an advocate for Internet privacy, encryption, and anonymity. Best of all? John Gilmore was the fifth employee of Sun Microsystems and most likely knew the technological underground that was busling at the time in Silicon Valley.
- What made this connection even more exciting was there are faculty at the time in Berkeley who was aware of cicada.berkeley.edu distros and even used them. One notable example is Dr. Michael Stiber, a Computational Biology professor who currently is teaching and researching for the University of Washington, but landed his first teaching post in UC Berkeley in 1996 (CV: [http://faculty.washington.edu/stiber/cv.pdf](http://faculty.washington.edu/stiber/cv.pdf)). Stiber used the cicada.berkeley.edu distro as a form of his e-mail when he co-authored this paper ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8971210](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8971210)). Furthermore, Stiber (being mostly still considered a professor in the biological sciences), has a very interesting Twitter headline in which he writes "I don't believe in anonymity." Therefore, Stiber has to be aware of cicada.berkeley.edu.
- Finally this public log was recorded by Webster University regarding on how cicada.berkeley.edu was used in relations of keeping them anonymous ([http://www.websteruniv.edu/~bumbaugh/net/net-anon.pt1](http://www.websteruniv.edu/~bumbaugh/net/net-anon.pt1)). As a result, it seems that cicada.berkeley.edu distros appear to have built the earliest forms of encryption and anonymity in relations of using the Internet as a form of communication and information transferring. As a result, it ties closely to the MO of how Cicada 3301 does things in relations to their puzzles thus far.
- Furthermore, the last time cicada.berkeley.edu was noted was at the end of 1994 (However, it is believed that the distros themselves were still active till the early 2000's) only to reappear in references again in 2011, the same year the puzzles were launched! (Needs a verification). Note here, that this is exactly 17 years in between. Like the cicadas that live underground for 17 years they have again, emerged. Some further speculate that in brood 0h (the name given to 2012 rectuits), 'h' stands for 17 in baseX encoding (X>17) using letters above 9 just like hexadecimal.
- By digging deeper into Cypherpunk, we have discovered that cicada.berkeley.edu distro's were just a mere prototype for the larger picture of the Cypherpunk Mailing List, which was in turn, the prototype to the darknet and Tor. The Cypherpunk Mailing List was eventually created beetween Eric Hughes (who developed the cicada.berkeley.edu distro), John Gilmore (now running his own Bay Area firm Cygnus Solutions) and Timothy C. May, who was one of the early electronic engineers working for Intel. The Cypherpunk Mailing List became popular for public debate regarding the privacy, freedom and neutrality of the Internet to philosophical, mathematical, computational, technological and cryptographic matters. Due to its anonymous and encrypted methods, mail bombers frequent used the service to target their victims with spam e-mails and until 2013, Al-Qaeda has even used the service.
- People who used Cypherpunk included Philip Zimmermann, who created PGP Signatures. Julian Assange (of the WikiLeaks fame) and even Tor developer Jacob Applebaum. These people are a fragment of many intellectuals, engineers and professors who used or develop the service. In a sense, cicada.berkeley.edu was the prototype to the Cypherpunk Mailing List, which in turn, might have influenced the creation of Tor and the darknet in 2003.
- I personally find it mildly interesting that Wilson was a long time Berkelely citizen. As Wilson states: "I know the Berkeley-San Pablo area; I lived there for eight years." Apparently "It is full of witches, or would-be witches, or loonies who think they are witches. They are constantly trying "psychic" experiments ... There are also parapsychology laboratories in Berkeley and nearby Palo Alto." Additionally, he mentions that "the New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn has its headquarters in Berkeley ... They trace their lineage back to the London Golden Dawn of Arthur Machen and William Butler Yeats." This is the same Golden Dawn in which Crowley joined in 1898 and began his training in the occult arts.
### Micheal Stiber

- This is the guy who sent me down this rabbit hole and made me look into Usenet so I'll start with him
- He's a computational biology professer and researcher at University of Washington. PHD in Computer Science in 1992. Landed his first teaching post in UC Berkeley in 1996. Today he is Director of Cybersecurity Initiatives (source: http://faculty.washington.edu/stiber/cv.pdf)
- Neuroscience paper published using cicada.berkeley.edu in 1994: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8971210/
- Mentioned here: https://web.archive.org/web/19970630213316/http://cicada.berkeley.edu/personnel/index.html
- This guy seems to be the link between the neuroscientists and computer scientists on this list. Must have been his colleagues
- Stibers Twitter bio previously said "I don't believe in anonymity." He has since taken it out, and in its place lies a mastodon account link. The bio of his mastodon says: "Sees social media weaponizing all of the semi-good-natured flame wars of Usenet newsgroups, sighs, and wonders why." Well usenet was an online disscussion platform founded in 1980 and predates the internet. People made posts and messages to one or more topic categories, known as newsgroups, sort of like 4chan or reddit. According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_(Internet)#History, the term "flaming" was coined in Usenet newsgroups and refers to aggressive and insulting behavior. "Flame trolling" refers to a provacative message, known as _flamebait_, with the intent of provoking an angry response (a "flame") or argument. A "flame war" results when multiple users engage in provocative responses to an original post. We of course cannot fail to see this pervading media today. Provoking anger is the go to stategy for capturing attention and maintaining engangement. Flamebait is what we might call "ragebait" today. This is epitome of twitter. Twitters short character limit prevents nuanced disscusion and allows for only enough info to maximize emotional reaction. It's "weaponized" in that it keeps people distracted with pointless issues while ignoring real one's. Also, everyone  gets filtered into there own seperate groups and pinned egainst each other which prevents from being able to form a politically effective hole

- is one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which according to https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation is an international non-profit digital rights group based in San Francisco 
- Founded Cygnus Solutions which is meant to provide commercial support for free software
- Known for being the creator of the "alt" newsgroup type on Usenet. It differed with others in that there was no centralized moderation and anyone who was capable of creating a newsgroup could do so.
- Associated with Eric Hughes. He worked with Hughes (creator of cicada.berkeley.edu) to make the Cypherpunk Mailing List. The Cypherpunk Mailing List became popular for public debate regarding the privacy, freedom and neutrality of the Internet to philosophical, mathematical, computational, technological and cryptographic matters.

### Timothy C May

### Eric Hollander

- Seems to be the most active person using the cicada.berkeley.edu distro. Also uses multiple other aliases and remailers
- The best suspect is this guy https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-hollander-0b267789 CEO of software company in Berkeley. B.A in molecular biology from Berkeley. Doesn't say when he graduated but his first job was in 1997 so probably shortly before that. Per https://chiralsoftware.com/about: "After graduation Eric followed his passion for computers, which he has had since he started programming as a pre-teen. His area of focus is in machine learning and thinking about how biological neural mechanisms could lead to more capable machines.Successful work as a prime contractor for the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies"

- Found out he was the "nobody" guy from this post: https://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1992/12/3e445d457f2e802ba3c3ef28274420c47e933ec3d465f6f55784c89ba6318a5b/. Same "e" signiture found in many others and a reference to the hh email. Talks about how hes made a bunch of these
- An interesting post from them supporting free exchange of info, advocating for privacy, and hoping they don't get "flamed" in Usenet newsgroups it seems: https://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1994/01/7aab47192a488504c799131cc9b8cc13e4f136cac10448ef31cc2af5f72408c7/ 
- if you search "cicada" on https://www.usenetarchives.com/index.php you can find more on this topic on page 8. This person also seems to have a ton of posts on what seems to be geopolitics from page 3 to like 7. Theres another form alt.privacy here: https://www.usenetarchives.com/view.php?id=alt.privacy&mid=PDkzMTEwNjA0MTYuQUEwNzc0OUBjaWNhZGEuYmVya2VsZXkuZWR1Pg.
