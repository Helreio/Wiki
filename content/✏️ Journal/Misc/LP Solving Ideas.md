- Look for repeating phrases and themes (ie. "Some wisdom") and look for instances where those phrases may be used again in the headings

- The heading at the top of page 33, when converted to enlish letters, shows up as "DEO XCFIAWHG." The only heading with three letters on a solved page is "THE LOSS OF DIVINITY." The writing style always uses words like "an," "a," or "the." It is possible that, if the letter lengths match, this word is the. The second word must also be a (idk what its called) type of noun.

- Look at reaccuring words from the solvers pages with the longest letter lengths and look for others within the unsolved pages that match the latter lengths

- I actually find the Odin idea pretty intruiging. The fact that where trying to interpret runes does make that myth seem relevent, i wouldnt be so quick to dismiss them. I dont think the bearded man is Odin, you could say its anybody with a big beard, but Ik what theyre talking about with Odin "deciphering runes" ive heard the story before. It sounds a lot like what wilson refers to as "meta-programming" in The New Inquisition.
- Apperently in norse mythology, they talk about how the world is "made of runes" which if understood allowed one to "shape the world." These runes are carved into the trunk of the great tree Yggdrasil by beings who come from the pool that Yggdrasil grows out of. Odin went down there with a desire to master these runes He hung from yggdrasil for nine nights until he eventually gained the ability to see and manipulate them and the world. Something like that
- Well in The New Inquisition, Wilson puts forth an idea that our brains will orgainize the mass of incoming signals our senses recieve into the preconfigured language systems that our brains have previously learned. You see this in referenced in question 7 of test .onion. In "meta-programming," we become aware of this process and are able to deliberatly increase the amount of signals consciously apprehended and notice things we usually ignore or see something in a new way. Its this idea that i think 3301 is refering to when they said: "program you mind, program reality"
