## Majors

List of reasons why I should do this:

- Autonomy
- Self-reliance

### Ideas

- Get 2 degrees, computer science and neuroscience
	- First, this will open up more prospects
	- Second, say you're ideas about psychiatry get you into trouble, you will have another degree to fall back on
	- If you think that money is interfearing with your genuine love for neuroscience, you can always leave and go for computer science to make ends meet

- **Neuroscience**
	- **Wiki:** **Neuroscience** is the [scientific study](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") of the [nervous system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system "Nervous system"). It is a [multidisciplinary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_approach "Multidisciplinary approach") science that combines [physiology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology "Physiology"), [anatomy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy "Anatomy"), [molecular biology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology "Molecular biology"), [developmental biology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology "Developmental biology"), [cytology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytology "Cytology"), [physics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [computer science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), [chemistry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") and [mathematical modeling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Modeling "Mathematical Modeling") to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of [neurons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron"), [glia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia "Glia") and [neural circuits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_circuit "Neural circuit"). The understanding of the biological basis of [learning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning "Learning"), [memory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory "Memory"), [behavior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior "Behavior"), [perception](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception "Perception"), and [consciousness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness") has been described by [Eric Kandel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kandel "Eric Kandel") as the "epic challenge" of the [biological sciences](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology").

- **Cognitive Science**
	- Specialize: Neuroscience, perception, linguistics, artificial intelligence 
	- **Wiki:** Cognitive science is the [interdisciplinary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity "Interdisciplinarity"), [scientific](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science")study of the [mind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind") and its processes with input from [linguistics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), [psychology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), [neuroscience](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience "Neuroscience"), [philosophy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [computer science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science")/[artificial intelligence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"), and [anthropology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology"). It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of [cognition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition "Cognition") (in a broad sense). Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform [information](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information "Information"). Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include [language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language"), [perception](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception "Perception"), [memory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory "Memory"), [attention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention "Attention"), [reasoning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoning "Reasoning"), and [emotion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion "Emotion"); to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as [linguistics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), [psychology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), [artificial intelligence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"), [philosophy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind "Philosophy of mind"), [neuroscience](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience "Neuroscience"), and [anthropology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology").

- **Computer Science**:
	- Specialize: artificial intelligence / machine learning, cryptography / cybersecurity 

Other:

- I think i have a solution to the problem that choosing a major years in advance is contraining and unatural. Do the bulk of studies personally in your zettelkasten, then do what mom was talking about where you can take test to skip courses. After a certain amount of time, you can of course look at you're graph to get an idea of where your intrest is leading you. Then, when you feel ready, you can go to college and do only what ever classes are necessary to finish a major and get a degree.
    - ❗️do not say anything about this until after you get your ged
- Go for a science because 1. Better jobs. 2. Scholarship matters much more with science, where as in the humanities it the idea itself that matters rather than who it came from or how the conclusion was reached. You can always read philosophy on the side
- if you want to be self sufficient and self reliant, or if you want to move away from your toxic parents, you _need_ a job eventually. Thus you have to persue college eventually. Bottom learning is unfortunately not how things work these days. Getting a job is what this is really about anyways. All the zettelkasten does here is ensure that you make a better decision

## Potential work

- Quaila Research Intitute
	- https://www.qualiaresearchinstitute.org/
	- Mission
	1.  Develop a precise mathematical language for describing subjective experience    
	2.  Understand the nature of emotional valence (happiness and suffering)    
	3.  Map out the full space of possible conscious experiences    
	4.  Build technologies to radically improve people's lives

- Mindstate design labs
	- https://www.mindstate.design/
	- “Our mission is to map the biological basis of the varieties of psychedelic experience, and to use that map to pharmacologically design therapeutic states of mind to be applied in medically supervised settings to heal the root causes of mental health disorders.”
	- “neuroscientists, medicinal chemists, computational experts, and drug development veterans”

- The EPRC
	- https://theeprc.org/
	- Buddhism is prominent here
	- “While each of our stories are different, their overall shape is very similar for most of us – being trained and working in our respective fields of inquiry while also having various emergent experiences that we knew were not well understood by science and clinical medicine but seemed to be described by various spiritual and religious traditions. Along the way, we all wrestled with the questions of how best to conceptualize and navigate the territory we found ourselves experiencing in order to appreciate the opportunities for growth and life enhancement that they offered while also realizing that some aspects of what was happening might be challenging in various ways.”
