# Project Ideas

## Writing

- write about misdiagnosis of gifted children and genius being mistaken for stupidity
- A mega book on mysticism which brings similar concepts between traditions into one while utilizing all of the best explanations. It would also serve as a book of correspondences while also explaining why they correspond. It would also discuss differences. It should include science too to fulfill my desire to unite science and mysticism
- Write a book or something about a new paradigm or approach to education involving zettlekasten, self-directed learning, non-forcing, etc.
- A blog post about being unable to convince others otherwise of your autism diagnosis
	- Title ideas:
		- My experience with being considered "special needs"
		- The difficulty of escaping the special needs label
- A.I art, the culture industry, and mechanistic thinking
	- We have become so tasteless and disconnected that we are satisfied with computer generated art based on things already created.
	- Great art is of the right hemisphere
- Essay and YouTube video on how the key to fulfilling relations ships is the capacity to be alone
- write an article about your experience with psychiatry and the insights you have dirived from it
- "Mindfulness is radical" an article about how mindfulness has been appropriated by capitalism and how real mindfulness will help leftists
- “The science behind the biblical creation story”
    - include in introduction: “science has proven the creation story! But maybe not in the way you think it has. Maybe the creation story is not what it seems to be for both secularists and the conventionally religious.

## Art
## Programming

- a search engine, rss reader and bookmarker combined. Has a blog section like googled video section
- a platform like medium but where people can link their blog posts from their own personal sites so it is not centrally owned
- Privacy offline minimalist ebook reader app
- Search engine that allows you to look for blogs like you can with videos and has built in RSS feed
- Some sort of tool to allow people to see what philosophical, psychological, or political issues are pertinent to the times sort of like how my obsidian graph shows me what topics are important to me
- Social media platform that
	- is P2P and not proof
	- Anonymous 
	- Is owned by users and distributed like a blockchain
	- Developed by users like Wikipedia
	- No advertising
	- Is a protocol instead of a singular platform like email or matrix so that people are not forced to use a central platform
	- Has either no algorithms or has reverse algorithms (my term): algorithms that may show you some content that you might _not_ be inclined to already watch, thus challenging your beliefs
- An obsidian a plugin that could allow you to copy the linked mentions of a note and paste them as links within the note
- Social media alternatives but you bring all the content on the other platforms to the new platform as well

## Studies

- measure activity of the hemispheres during meditation
- Study vipassana on people with ADHD
- See wether psychedelics silence the left hemisphere
- Study wether mindfulness of the negative aspects of short term rewards helps people delay gratification
- Give split Brian subjects a ouija board

## Other

- Create your own language that is
	- without nouns
	- without words like "all" 
	- is easy to create new words in
- Create a script or something that lets you open random notes and will read them text to speech
- Also maybe create something that will read each of your notes in an outline or mock in order
- Rolling chairs which you can remove the seat on top and it will turn into a stool
- A college or even an entire schooling system of schooling where it’s structured like a zettelkasten. No predetermined structures. You just let your interest guide you. You can take classes whenever you want, start at any point in that course, or study in any other way you want as long as you can pass the tests. There are still degrees, but you can decide to take classes to complete that degree once you figure out what your interested in. You do not have to choose a major from the start. There will be no credits and you will only have to study the required material for a certain degree. No extra unnecessary classes.
