Yeah i can. Don't take my word for it. Look into it for yourself. Plz educate me if i'm wrong i don't want to mislead. Here's some notes of mine. I decided not to write this out into messages in here cuz it would be too long and clog up chat:

- [Psychiatric diagnosis is dependent on subjective judgement rather than empirical tests]()
    - Ever wonder why they don't test you for a mental disorder?
- [The claim that ADHD is caused by low dopamine levels is a drug-marketing claim with little evidence]()
- [An overabundance of dopamine in schizophrenics has yet to be found]()
- [A shortage of serotonin in the brain has not yet been found in depression patients]()
- [The brain adapts to psychotropic drugs by increasing or decreasing neurotransmitter production and receptor density]()
- [Amphetamines are known to induce psychotic and manic episodes]()
- [There are many reports of children experiencing psychosis during stimulant treatment for ADHD]()
- [Stimulant treatment causes patients to cycle through arousal and dysphoric states on a daily basis]()
- [The symptoms of stimulant treatment for ADHD closely resemble those of bipolar disorder]()
- [Long-term administration of antidepressants in children show risk for the development of bipolar disorder]()
- [A majority of bipolar cases were shown to be preceded by stimulant or antidepressant]()

- "next time ping mods when someone makes some headass medical claim please and thankx. glad mindfulness and to do lists and pulling urself up by ur bootstraps(which is *actually* ableist rhetoric btw)worked for u bryc33b01! you probably shouldnt have been on stimulants because you dont have adhd!!!"
    - Do you mean ping mods to ban me? Plz don't ban me for that and just correct me. I have a literal diagnosis of ADHD that i resonate with so that's kinda invalidating. It really sucks to deal with. Im only speaking from personal experience. For example when i first tried implementing a reading routine i could hardly do it. Now its waaay easier than it used to be. I never took meds because my side effects to stimulants were really bad so my parents just stopped. I came across this stuff trying to find alternative ways to deal with it. I was already aware of neuroplasiticity and wondered if that could apply to ADHD and this is where it led me
    - I never said to pull yourself up by your bootstraps either idk where that came from. Not sure what you mean by that either
- "Neural circuitry *is* neural chemistry, my guy. All "circuitry" in the human body  (neurons specifically) works that way. 

   ADHD (and "overcoming it") isnt nearly as simple as you're putting it. Like, at *all*. Executive dysfunction is only one facet--not to mention emotional dysregulation, reduced region volume, etc, etc."
    - By neural circuitry i mean strength synaptic density. And that's increased through use right? Besides doesn't my point still apply there? Wouldn't you be able to implement practices that help improve emotional regulation, increase regional density, etc., overtime? Executive functions are just one example. Idk much about regional density all i know is you have reduced volume in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. It would be nice to find more neural correlates to ADHD that i can add to my notes
- "Sun tzu, please for the love of GOD do not take medical advice from strangers in the offtopic general chat. And dont let them scare you regarding your prescribed medication use either."
    - Definitely talk to your doctor about it i'm just a guy. It's not medical advice anyways. I never said to just take my word for it. I'm just putting an alternative perspective out there that i think is important. You guys can look into it for yourself and come to your own conclusions. In the same way, people shouldn't just blindly trust everything their doctors tell them. If they happen to be skeptical of something they should entertain that skepticism. Either way the data does the talking and not the doctors qualifications
