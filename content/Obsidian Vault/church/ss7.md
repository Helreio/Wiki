#ChristAndTheEverlastingGospel

From *The Laborers in the Vineyard* by Jeffery R Holland, I got the message, "Step UP." I respond well to that tough love sort of approach, and I feel like it's pertinent. I can still have the same blessings, and any delay I feel like I have already is irrelevant, because the infinite blessing is the same. Contrast that with many earthly pursuits, where delays and procrastination can leave you hopelessly behind. That won't be the case. I'll stand right beside the people I taught on the mission, my parents, my friends, and people who just came to the gospel at the last minute. That's encouraging, and helps me work through feelings of guilt and inadequacy. 

Questions:
- was peter the only married disciple?

cool words: Apocalypse and apocrypha mean the opposite things: revealed and concealed.

The Transfiguration at the mount happened in October. Idk why that's interesting to me. I'll probably remember that every october now.

Jesus did nothing to promote Himself. Just taught powerful doctrines and did miracles. In one of the books, it's emphasized that He he purposefully tried to limit those who knew of Him.

Matt 15:19 -> out of the heart proceed evil... 
That's significant, because out of the heart proceed good things, too. We need to have a discerning mind in order to properly guide our feelings. 

17:21
Some things are just harder. You have to put in some work and not just a moment of faith. Consistent effort, sustained, incremental progression. 

I, personally, need to be more serious about how I obey the commandments. The Lord will give as much as he takes away. If I don't follow the commandments I will be included in the wicked, and they don't get anything. I really got this after watching the story of moses leaving egypt in the animated movie about it.
