Exodus 20 - 10 commandments. Very authoritative, and strong. It lays down the law. The tone isn't emotional, but just frank. Combined with my knowledge of Heavenly Father's love, it paints a more comprehensive picture. Serious demands, unconditional and eternal love, and the two are inseperable. 

Leviticus 1 - very primitive feel. Idk, it's animal sacrifice. If I did it now, I'd probably be put in an asylum. But it's all symbolic and part of our heritage. It wasn't so weird to them, especially since they were around animals and death so much more. Anyway, Christ was God following his own demands in spirit.

Moses was highly experienced. His list of accomplishments and privledges are unmatched. How are people like that chosen and created for such high callings?

These innovations were known as the “traditions of the elders.” By New Testament times among the Jews the law had become so altered it had lost much of its spiritual meaning.

How do we know we aren't doing that right now?
