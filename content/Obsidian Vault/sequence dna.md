- just cut it alll up. stack the little pieces above the big ones. Seems like the little sequences that come chopped up from the chromosomes tend to start at the same places, and it's easiest to read only the ends. lots of variation in chopped size means you can read the whole thing. 
- use [[dna replication, short tandem repeats#thermal cycler|primers and polymerase]] again
- add free [[nucleotides]] and florescent ones, which are always the last ones to get grabbed. these are the ones that are read by the laser
- smallest pieces get through the gel first. So, the computer gets the stacked pieces. 
- scientists and forensic people get an output in the form of a chromatograph: ![[Pasted image 20220531230523.png]]
- NCBI has like, all of the sequences. You can compare the many sequences using BLAST on their site. [BLAST: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)
