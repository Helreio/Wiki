# Dot Product
multiply each number in a vector by the one in the corresponding index in the other. then add it all up.

## Length of vector
#card
dot product with itself, square root. 
it's the pythagorean theorem. 
$$||v||=\sqrt{v\cdot v}$$

## unit vector
#card 

$$||cv|| = |c|\ ||v||$$
vector divided by its length, you get a vector of length 1

## Distance:
#card
$$dist(u,w)=||u-w||$$
you are basically subtracting the vectors, and doing pythagorean to get the length of that resulting vector

## **cauchy-schwartz**
#card
$$|u\cdot w|\leq ||u||\ ||w||$$
basically, the dot product is always smaller than the two lengths multiplied

## **triangle inequality**
#card
$$||u+w||=||u||+||w||$$
the length of the added vectors is always smaller than the added lengths of the vectors.

## **angles?**
%%
#card 
%%
$$cos\theta = \frac{uv}{||u||\ ||v||}=\frac{u}{||u||}\cdot \frac{v}{||v||}$$
