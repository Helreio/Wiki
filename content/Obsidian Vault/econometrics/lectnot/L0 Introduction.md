# L0 Introduction

1.  Opening Prayer

2.  About me

    -  Raised in Salt Lake City, mission in Seoul Korea, Economics major at BYU, met my wife at BYU, PhD at University of Rochester, research in political economics (also teach Econ 477), 4 kids, sincerely believe in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the mission of BYU.

    -  I enjoy teaching Econ 378 because the material is so useful for students, which is rewarding. It is also hard, so making it interesting and easy is a fun challenge.

3.  Data analysis in Economics

    -  Scientific method: observe patterns, theorize, test theories, policy implications, policy calibration

    -  Theory: Econ 110, 380-382, 400+

    -  Evidence: Econ 378, 388, 400+, Research, internships, jobs (big data industrial transition)

    -  Economics is *both* (recommend Econ 210 for exploring careers in Economics, also MATH 213/215 linear algebra)

4.  Probability and statistics

    -  Often care about population but observe only sample.
 Can't know what's true, but can know what's *probably* true

-  Probability is the language of uncertainty

-  Probability theory also useful in theoretical models of risk/uncertainty (e.g. insurance, investments, search, asymmetric information)
