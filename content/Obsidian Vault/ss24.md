The Living Christ is cool because they really created an abrangent statement on who He is. 
Reading the Nicene Creed article, just a few sentences in, I feel completely called out. I was rough on them on my mission, because I blamed them for every doctrinal impurity since. It's a ton simpler that way, but I guess simplifying things always brings with it the risk of painting people in a bad light for what may just be misguided ideas or easy mistakes. 
It's interesting that the Holy Ghost wasn't even really addressed. They wanted to keep Monotheism while still having Jesus be divine. It was a dissonance that we're still dealing with today, because of everything Christ did, and our own limited understanding.
Wow! Most of the people at the time agreed with the LDS perspective! They weren't so far off! It was a real, heated controversy, too. Not like it is today, with most of the Christian world in concordance over the false doctrine. 
I like Arius.
