### negatives:
- lots of problems people talk about.
	look up:
	- why i left dms guild
	- problems with dms guild

- iron fist about what's ok
	piece of art that was too much like official dnd content. shut down entire deal until obeyed.
	
- biig cut. 50% goes to dnd
- interface not modern
- not a ton of people are very dedicated

### positives:
- tons of attention from dnd company. 
- conversations with corporate.
- fantastic community involvement and support
- you can straight up pull characters and entire pages from existing dnd books
- like onebookshelf <- more general
- scouting system. 'adepts' are more in the know, can get exclusive access to unreleased stuff to write stuff ahead of time.
- **art**
	- writers get free art from dnd company
	- maybe connect artists/illustrators
- pay what you want price (price discrimination)

### notes
- people collaborate on google docs and an **unofficial** discord server, send result to formatter. 
	- asking questions about vampire lore, historical accuracy, asking for more writers, asking for/about art, selling art in dedicated discord channels
	- the community is very liberal. don't say anything right-wing or central or you get kicked off the server
- ranking system of sellers -- this helps with seeking out quality stuff

OGL - open gaming license
Big games like dnd make some sections (about a single book's worth) of their content public domain in order to stimulate creation, and to avoid having to enforce copyright claims to common content. 

There's a ton of content, dnd is kinda blowing up. Especially in middle schools and high schools.
