    - The Plan and the Proclamation [[https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/the-plan-and-the-proclamation?lang=eng]]
        - What did President Oaks say converted Latter-day Saints believe about the Family Proclamation?→Converted Latter-day Saints believe that the family proclamation, issued nearly a quarter century ago and now translated into scores of languages, is the Lord’s reemphasis of the gospel truths we need to sustain us through current challenges to the family.
        - 
        - What process did the First Presidency and Quorum of Twelve use in the creation of the family proclamation?→The inspiration identifying the need for a proclamation on the family came to the leadership of the Church over 23 years ago. It was a surprise to some who thought the doctrinal truths about marriage and the family were well understood without restatement.8 Nevertheless, we felt the confirmation and we went to work. Subjects were identified and discussed by members of the Quorum of the Twelve for nearly a year. Language was proposed, reviewed, and revised. Prayerfully we continually pleaded with the Lord for His inspiration on what we should say and how we should say it. We all learned “line upon line, precept upon precept,” as the Lord has promised (D&C 98:12).
        - 
        - Elder Oaks declared that the Family Proclamation is a statement of eternal truth and the will of God for His children who seek eternal life. T/F?→True
        - 
        - Why did Elder Oaks say some people "consider this family proclamation as just a statement of policy that should be changed?”→Those who do not believe in or aspire to exaltation and are most persuaded by the ways of the world consider this family proclamation as just a statement of policy that should be changed.

- 1. The Eternal Family and the Nature of God
    - Our Identity and Our Destiny [[https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/tad-r-callister_our-identity-and-our-destiny/]]
        - What doctrine defines our destiny? Why?→You are a child of God. He is the father of your spirit. Spiritually you are of noble birth, the offspring of the King of Heaven. Fix that truth in your mind and hold to it. However many generations in your mortal ancestry, no matter what race or people you represent, the pedigree of your spirit can be written on a single line. You are a child of God! If one does not correctly understand his divine identity, then he will never correctly understand his divine destiny. They are, in truth, inseparable partners.
        - 
            - What are the five witnesses that speak of our potential?→For our search of truth, we will turn to five witnesses—first and foremost to the testimony of the scriptures; second, to the witness of the early Christian writers; third, to the wisdom of those poets and authors who drink from the divine well; fourth, to the power of logic; and fifth, to the voice of history.
        - 
        - What three things allow us to have “unlimited opportunities to progress toward [our] destiny of godhood”?→Being immersed in a world of good and evil, having the capacity to choose, and being able to draw upon the powers of the Atonement resulted in man having unlimited opportunities to progress toward his destiny of godhood.
        - 
        - What logical reason do we have for believing in our divine destiny?→Do not the laws of science teach us that like begets like, each after its kind? Science has taught us that a complex genetic code transferred from parent to child is responsible for the child attaining the physical attributes of his parents.
        - 
        - Rather than viewing the saving ordinances as a checklist of actions, how should we see them?→they are the keys that open the doors to heavenly powers that can lift us above our mortal limitations.
        - 
    - ‘A Mother There’: A Survey of Historical Teachings about Mother in Heaven [[https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/mother-there-survey-historical-teachings-about-mother-heaven]]
        - What did President Hinckley teach about our ability to add to or diminish Heavenly Mother’s glory?→The fact that we do not pray to our Mother in Heaven in no way belittles or denigrates her. . . . None of us can add to or diminish the glory of her of whom we have no revealed knowledge.
        - 
        - Besides statements speaking of Heavenly Mother’s procreative role, what other roles and/or responsibilities have Church leaders spoken about?→we will share historical portrayals of Heavenly Mother as procreator and parent, as a divine person, as co-creator of worlds, as coframer of the plan of salvation with the Father, and as a concerned and loving parent involved in our mortal probation. Finally, we will sketch portrayals of her role in the eschaton.
        - 
        - 
        - Do we have evidence of General Authorities advising us not to speak about Heavenly Mother? (note: Howard Brewster is not a general authority)→[No.] Our investigation marshals evidence against some claims that General Authorities and other Church leaders have limited Heavenly Mother’s role to reproduction. It also refutes the suspicion that General Authorities have advocated a position of total sacred silence about her.
        - 
    - What did President Harold B. Lee teach about Heavenly Mother in comparison to our earthly mothers?→President Rudger Clawson (Quorum of the Twelve, October 10, 1989–June 21, 1943) disagreed that deifying our Heavenly Mother risked divided worship. He urged, “It doesn’t take from our worship of the Eternal Father, to adore our Eternal Mother, any more than it diminishes the love we bear our earthly fathers, to include our earthly mothers in our affections.
    - Becoming like God [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng]]
        - Why is it natural to assume that we can become like our Heavenly Parents?→Just as a child can develop the attributes of his or her parents over time, the divine nature that humans inherit can be developed to become like their Heavenly Father’s.
        - 
            - When was the concept of deification first disputed by an early church father?→One modern scholar refers to the “ubiquity of the doctrine of deification”—the teaching that humans could become God—in the first centuries after Christ’s death.11 The church father Irenaeus, who died about A.D. 202, asserted that Jesus Christ “did, through His transcendent love, become what we are, that He might bring us to be what He is Himself.”
        - 
        - How did the teaching of creation ex nihilo impact how Christians saw men and women's relationship with God?→Creation ex nihilo widened the perceived gulf between God and humans.
        - 
        - What two things are necessary for “receiving one’s full inheritance as a child of Heavenly Father”?→available through the Atonement of Christ, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.
        - 
        - How do Latter-day Saints understand the magnitude of the atonement of Jesus Christ?→Latter-day Saints understand the magnitude of the Atonement of Christ in terms of the vast human potential it makes possible. Christ’s Atonement not only provides forgiveness from sin and victory over death, it also redeems imperfect relationships, heals the spiritual wounds that stifle growth, and strengthens and enables individuals to develop the attributes of Christ.

    - The Eternal Family [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1996/11/the-eternal-family?lang=eng]]
        - What four things does Satan try to do because of the importance of family?→Because of the importance of the family to the eternal plan of happiness, Satan makes a major effort to destroy the sanctity of the family, demean the importance of the role of men and women, encourage moral uncleanliness and violations of the sacred law of chastity, and to discourage parents from placing the bearing and rearing of children as one of their highest priorities.

- 2. The Plan of Salvation and the Eternal Family
    - Why marriage, Why Family by D. Todd Christofferson [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2015/04/why-marriage-why-family?lang=eng]]
        - According to Elder Christofferson, why is marriage more than the love couples feel for each other?↔It's a post/ office in the kingdom of God. Best setting for God's plan to thrive.
        - Why can no person or government alter the divine order of matrimony?↔It is not a human invention. Such marriage is indeed “from above, from God” and is as much a part of the plan of happiness as the Fall and the Atonement.
        - What four things did Elder Christofferson teach are "needed for the success of [God's] plan"?↔Creation of the Earth, condition of mortality, redemption from the fall, setting for our physical birth and subsequent spiritual rebirth into the kingdom of God.
    - Teaching the Doctrine of the Family [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2011/03/teaching-the-doctrine-of-the-family?lang=eng]]
        - What did President Julie B. Beck teach that the theology of the family is based on?→the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement.
        - Rather than a consumer approach to dating, how did President Beck describe dating and courtship?→faith-based work.
    - Marriage Is Essential to His Eternal Plan [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2006/06/marriage-is-essential-to-his-eternal-plan?lang=eng]]
        - What were Elder Bednar’s two reasons for why eternal marriage is essential to our exaltation?→Reason 1: The natures of male and female spirits complete and perfect each other, and therefore men and women are intended to progress together toward exaltation. Reason 2: By divine design, both a man and a woman are needed to bring children into mortality and to provide the best setting for the rearing and nurturing of children.
        - Which issues did Elder Bednar say constitute Satan’s most direct and diabolical attack on the family?→Satan works unremittingly to confuse understanding about gender, to promote the premature and unrighteous use of procreative power, and to hinder righteous marriage precisely because marriage is ordained of God and the family is central to the plan of happiness.
        - According to Elder Bednar, where must we look in order to overcome Satan’s counterfeit messages regarding gender and marriage?→understanding the intent of an enemy is a key prerequisite to effective preparation.
    - The Great Plan of Happiness [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1993/10/the-great-plan-of-happiness?lang=eng]]
        - What eight ways did President Oaks say that Satan would try to destroy the plan?→Satan seeks to discredit the Savior and divine authority, to nullify the effects of the Atonement, to counterfeit revelation, to lead people away from the truth, to contradict individual accountability, to confuse gender, to undermine marriage, and to discourage childbearing (especially by parents who will raise children in righteousness).
        - What did Adam and Eve need to do to keep the first commandment?→They could not fulfill the Father’s first commandment without transgressing the barrier between the bliss of the Garden of Eden and the terrible trials and wonderful opportunities of mortal life.
        - What did Eve transgress to initiate the conditions of mortality?→The boundaries of the garden of Eden
        - What was the first commandment given to Adam and Eve?→the Lord said, “Be fruitful, and multiply”
    - Choose Ye This Day [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/choose-you-this-day?lang=eng]]
        - According to our readings, what is Heavenly Father's goal in parenting?→Our Heavenly Father’s goal in parenting is not to have His children do what is right; it is to have His children choose to do what is right and ultimately become like Him.
        - 
        - Why is opposition and a veil necessary for the use of agency?→To ensure that we would exercise faith and learn to use our agency properly, a veil of forgetfulness was drawn over our minds so we would not remember God’s plan. Without that veil, God’s purposes would not be achieved because we could not progress and become the trusted inheritors He wants us to be.
        - What is the relationship between commandments and agency?→Obedience to His commandments is not blind; we knowingly choose God and His pathway home. The pattern for us is the same as it was for Adam and Eve, wherein “God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption.” Though God wants us to be on the covenant path, He gives us the dignity of choosing.
        - 
        - What is the relationship between commandments and God's goal for our destiny?→They are linked to our developing the attributes of godliness, returning to our Heavenly Father, and receiving enduring joy.

- 3. Jesus Christ – The Sure Foundation of Eternal Family
    - Justification and Sanctification [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2001/06/justification-and-sanctification?lang=eng]]
        - “If justification removes the punishment for past sin, then sanctification ________.”→then sanctification removes the stain or effects of sin.
        - Though we cannot earn the grace of Christ, what must we do to receive it?→Thus, it is not that we earn these gifts, but rather that we choose to seek and accept justification and sanctification.
        - What is the medium through which Christ’s atoning grace is applied?→The Holy Spirit
        - Is perfection dependent on justification and sanctification, or is justification and sanctification dependent on perfection?→the first one
    - Hope in Christ [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/28ballard?lang=eng]]
        - What is necessary in order to guarantee exaltation?→everyone who is faithful in keeping gospel covenants will have the opportunity for exaltation.
        - 
        - How did Elder Ballard define “waiting on the Lord?→Third, waiting upon the Lord implies continued obedience and spiritual progress toward Him. Waiting upon the Lord does not imply biding one’s time. You should never feel like you are in a waiting room.
        - 
- Waiting upon the Lord implies action.
- 
    - The Gift of Grace [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2015/05/sunday-morning-session/the-gift-of-grace?lang=eng]]
        - True or false: According to the reading, the Atonement restores us to our previous innocent state.→False. But the grace of God does not merely restore us to our previous innocent state. If salvation means only erasing our mistakes and sins, then salvation—as wonderful as it is—does not fulfill the Father’s aspirations for us. His aim is much higher: He wants His sons and daughters to become like Him.
    - What two things does grace do according to Elder Uchtdorf?→To that end I would like to speak of grace. In particular, first, how grace unlocks the gates of heaven and, second, how it opens the windows of heaven.
    - Why do “we seek to obey our Heavenly Father"?→We seek to obey our Heavenly Father because our spirits will become more attuned to spiritual things. Vistas are opened that we never knew existed.
    - What doesn't "after all we can do" mean according to Elder Uchtdorf?→I wonder if sometimes we misinterpret the phrase “after all we can do.” We must understand that “after” does not equal “because.”
        - Sermon on the Mount Commentary [[https://byu.instructure.com/courses/12380/files/4216714/download?wrap=1]]
            - Prepare to share three lessons you learned from your study of the Sermon on the Mount Commentary→false prophets are specifically warned against by Christ. Jesus was looking at the apostles during the ‘take no thought for the morrow’ part. there are two kinds of judging: final judgments, which we are forbidden to make, and intermediate judgments, which we are directed to make, but upon righteous principles.
        - Is Faith in the Atonement of Jesus Christ Written in Our Hearts? [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2012/10/is-faith-in-the-atonement-of-jesus-christ-written-in-our-hearts?lang=eng]]
            - According to Sister Burton, what are three principles that will increase our faith in Jesus Christ?→Principle 1: “All that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.”,
- Principle 2: There is power in the Atonement to enable us to overcome the natural man or woman and become true disciples of Jesus Christ.,
- Principle 3: The Atonement is the greatest evidence we have of the Father’s love for His children.
- 4. The Role of Prophets, Seers, and Revelators in Teaching the Eternal Family
    - What Is Truth? [[https://religion.byu.edu/eternal-family/doctrines-principles-and-applications]] [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/article/ces-devotionals/2013/01/what-is-truth?lang=eng]]
        - Why is it helpful to realize that we may only have partial information when we are trying to interpret prophetic teachings?→we can avoid missing important information.
        - What is "part of our problem in the question for truth"?→human wisdom has disappointed us so often
        - How does Satan attack those who already embrace the truth? What is one of his “primary strategies”?→spread the seeds of doubt
        - What does the invitation to "trust the Lord" not remove from us?→The invitation to trust the Lord does not relieve us from the responsibility to know for ourselves.
        - What counsel was given for when we are confronted with information that conflicts with the revealed word of God?→remember that the blind men in the parable of the elephant would never be able to accurately describe the full truth.
    - Faith Is Not Blind [[https://speeches.byuh.edu/devotional/faith-is-not-blind]]
        - What are the Hafens’ three levels of dealing with uncertainty and how can understanding them help us?→acting like there is only the real and ideal, acting like there is only the ideal, and acting like there is only the real.
        - What were the Hafens’ four suggestions to work through our questions and exercise faith?→faithful questions; be cautious about the Internet’s weaknesses as a source of information about the Church; let’s focus on the hugely positive doctrinal content of the Restoration, rather than becoming sidetracked with the details of how Joseph received that content; cultivate an attitude of meekness. When our idealism has been rattled by abrupt confrontations with realism, our attitude about what has happened is more important than what has happened.
    - Doctrines, Principles, and Applications [[https://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/transcripts/educationweek/1998_06_04_bednar.htm]]
        - How did Elder Bednar define a teaching as a “doctrine”?→doctrine refers to the eternal, unchanging, and simple truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There are several key words in that definition: eternal, unchanging, simple, and truth.
        - What is necessary in order to understand some more sensitive or difficult doctrines?→ask in the father’s name for understanding.
        - How did Elder Bednar define a principle?→Principles are doctrinally based guidelines for what we ought to do. Therefore, if there is a doctrine of the Atonement, then the first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
    - Will You Engage in the Wrestle [[https://www.byui.edu/devotionals/sheri-dew]]
        - Why are questions different than doubts and how can they lead to good?→we can be seekers instead of doubters.
        - Why can "not asking questions" be far more dangerous than asking questions?→In other words, sin makes you stupid-and so does refusing to seek after truth.
        - Why are spiritual wrestlers also seekers?→They are men and women of faith who want to understand more than they presently do and who are serious about increasing the light and knowledge in their lives
        - Where do our challenges lie in what we don't know instead of what we think we know?→It lies in what we don't yet know.
        - Why can’t we think our way to conversion?→You cannot think your way to conversion, because you cannot convince your mind of something your heart does not feel.
        - What habits do seekers have?→Seekers have certain habits that are key to learning to communicate with God. For starters, they engage in the wrestle, meaning they work at it. They immerse themselves regularly in the scriptures, because the scriptures are the textbook for the Lord's language. They also work to be increasingly pure-pure in their heart and thoughts, pure in what they say, watch, read, and listen to. Purity invites the Spirit. And then, pure seekers listen. One of my former institute students periodically turns everything electronic off. TV off. Music off. Phone off. Computer off. She says, "I like to let the Lord know I'm listening
    - Truth and the Plan [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan?lang=eng]]

        - What is the mission of the restored church?→help the children of God achieve the supernal blessing of exaltation in the celestial kingdom, which can be attained only through an eternal marriage between a man and a woman
        - What leads the church to oppose social and legal pressure to alter God's definition of marriage?→Our knowledge of God’s revealed plan of salvation requires us.

        - According to President Oaks, how do we show God we love Him?→We show that love by “keep[ing] [His] commandments.”
        - President Nelson identified two eternal laws that are most significant in relation to LGBTQ issues. One was God’s law of marriage. What was the other one?→its companion law of chastity.
        - Why are God’s laws always a manifestation of God’s love?→“God’s laws are motivated entirely by His infinite love for us and His desire for us to become all we can become.”
    - Same-Sex Attraction and Transgender from ChurchOfJesusChrist.org [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/gay/individuals?lang=eng]] [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/transgender/]]

        - What is the intended meaning of gender in “The Family: A Proclamation to the World”?→biological sex at birth.
        - Are all of God’s promised blessings available to those who experience transgenderism?→yes.
    - The Divine Institution of Marriage [[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/the-divine-institution-of-marriage]]
        - According to our readings, what reasons are there for the “special status granted marriage”?→its central role in the creation of life. Values. Family bonds.
        - What is the relationship of tolerance to diversity?→oaks, Tolerance is a way of reacting to diversity, not a command to insulate it from examination.”
        - According to our readings, why will the Church “continue to defend the sanctity of marriage between a man and a women” in the public square?→it is a compelling moral issue of profound importance to our religion and to the future of society.
- 6. Eternal Covenants and Ordinances
    - Why the Covenant Path? [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/54christofferson?lang=eng]]
        - How do we open the door to every spiritual blessing and privilege?→“Your commitment to follow the Savior by making covenants with Him and then keeping these covenants

        - What did Elder Kofford say he believes sealing refers to?→the “sealing ordinance” or “being sealed” rather than just “being married in the temple.”
            - What do we know about the patriarchal order?→The gospel, which is called “the new and everlasting covenant,” includes many specific covenants, one being called “the new and everlasting covenant of marriage.” This title, or name, is simply another way of saying “patriarchal order.”
        - Why did Elder Kofford say we need a temple recommend before entering the temple?→once you enter the temple, you are expected and required to live the covenants you will make there. 2nd [D&C 109:20]: “No unclean [unworthy] thing shall be permitted to come into thy house to pollute it.”
        - If there is a difficulty in a marriage that is serious enough to threaten the marriage relationship, what counsel does Elder Kofford provide?→whenever there is a difficulty between a husband and wife in their marriage relationship that is serious enough to threaten that relationship, one or the other (or both) is not living the gospel of Jesus Christ. That means that one or both of the marriage partners are not keeping the covenants, commitments, and promises they made at the altar of the temple. If you love God enough and follow His teachings, everything else will work out just fine and you will be blessed to find solutions.

        - What did Joseph Smith say was the greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us?→seek after our dead.

        - What did Elder Oaks promise would be the case regarding relationships in the spirit world or in the kingdoms of glory?→“You are worried about the wrong things. You should be worried about whether you will get to those places. Concentrate on that. If you get there, all of it will be more wonderful than you can imagine.”
        - What two teachings from Joseph Smith regarding the spirit world have been repeatedly taught by other prophets and apostles?→family members who were righteous will be together in the world of spirits. “The spirits of the just are exalted to a greater and more glorious work … [in] the world of spirits. … They are not far from us, and know and understand our thoughts, feelings, and motions, and are often pained therewith.”
            - What two principles do we need to know to have faith that all will be well in the spirit world and beyond?→remember that God loves His children and will surely do what is best for each of us. Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
- 7. Single Life, Dating and Courtship
    - To the Singles of the Church [[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/ces-devotionals/2011-09-to-the-singles-of-the-church?lang=eng]]
        - What did Sister Oaks say are eternal “truths” for singles to understand?→Truth number one: The Lord loves us, He answers prayers, and, most importantly, He delights in blessing those who keep His commandments—but He does so in His own time and His own way. Truth number two: We are not saved in isolation. This life is not just about me.
        - What did Sister Oaks say would be the consequences if we cannot bear the difficulties and challenges while we are single?→you will never be able to bear the difficulties and challenges of married life.
