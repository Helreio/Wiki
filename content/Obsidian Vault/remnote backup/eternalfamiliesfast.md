- 2. The Plan of Salvation and the Eternal Family
    - Why marriag, Why Family by D. Todd Christofferson

        - Why can no person or government alter the divine order of matrimony?↔It is not a human invention. Such marriage is indeed “from above, from God” and is as much a part of the plan of happiness as the Fall and the Atonement.

        - Which issues did Elder Bednar say constitute Satan’s most direct and diabolical attack on the family?→Satan works unremittingly to confuse understanding about gender, to promote the premature and unrighteous use of procreative power, and to hinder righteous marriage precisely because marriage is ordained of God and the family is central to the plan of happiness.
        - According to Elder Bednar, where must we look in order to overcome Satan’s counterfeit messages regarding gender and marriage?→understanding the intent of an enemy is a key prerequisite to effective preparation.
