### equivalent if
#card 
Two systems are equivalent if they have the same solution set. All solutions have to be the same.

### theorem
#card
A system can either have:
- one solution
- no solution
- $\infty$ solutions

### is it consistent?
#card/reverse 
a system with one or more solutions is consistent. If it has no solution it's inconsistent. 
[[homogeneous]] systems are all consistent, since the zero solution (trivial solution) is always an answer. 
in the [[matrix representation of systems of linear equations#reduced row echelon form|reduced row echelon form]], a no solution matrix will have zeroes in the bottom row, except the last column. Basically saying, "0=1".
