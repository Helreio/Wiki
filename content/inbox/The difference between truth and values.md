# The difference between truth and values

[[Truth]] are about objective [[Facts]]. If you make a statement about what is, and it turns out what you said is not what really is, then you just said a lie. Conversely, if you make a statement about what is, and it turns out what you said is what really is, then you are stating a truth.
