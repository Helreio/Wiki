# 2020-08 Monthly report

## Summary

This month, I faced three setbacks that really challenged my emotional equilibrium: Gripo’s death, Oreo’s death, and the LPR. The death of the dogs will lead me to really study stoicism. The LPR would force me to go through a strict diet that would make me lose 30 pounds. This month, I also transitioned into a new Macbook Pro as my favorite bike trail started to disappear. Perhaps the biggest win of this month was Lea’s surprise dinner date with four of my friends, which will be the inspiration for Fruit Salad.

## Good Events

- Tungkomunidad meet. Made new friends: Fitz, Maui, others.
- I received a heartfelt appreciation of my work from Doc Ofel.
- Converge internet was finally installed.
- Received wonderful condolences from friends who learned of Gripo’s death.
- Lea’s surprise dinner date with Rem, Claire, Benjie, and JV (08-05-2020).
- First time to wear face shield and ride the jeep since the lockdown.
- I experienced getting inside a hospital during the quarantine.
- Joined the Hayahay Challenge for a few days.
- I received my new Macbook Pro and migrated my data into it.
- Experienced roasting a chicken with Dondon.
- Went to the grocery for the first time since the lockdown.
- Talked to Megs after quite some time.
- Lea left QC finally.
- I got an scholarship from BASB but rejected it.

## Setback and Challenges

- Gripo died (08-03-2020).
- My favorite bike trail was slowly disappearing. My and Dondon’s favorite spot that got us through the lockdown was gone. It is the trail where blog posts, poems, decisions, fantasy stories, philosophical insights were born, and tears were shed. Because of its demise, I was encouraged to look for alternatives, to explore San Jacinto for other nature spots.
- I started feeling signs of a sensation in my throat. I would later learn that I have LPR. This forced me to modify my diet and lose weight along the way. I have lost 30 pounds since September (or about 13.6 kilos).
- Oreo died (08-14-2020).
- Dondon also almost died. These connections with death kept me in touch with mortality and with it, stoicism. I started being more interested in the philosophy. I started reading the Stoic Challenge.

## Personal Triumphs

- This month, I became more intentional in connecting with friends during the pandemic.
- I took the initiative of calling Ate Mau and her family so I don’t feel so lonely.
- I finished working on my life system’s Sky Level.
- Finished organizing my paper file system.
- I found the courage to use my PWD card.
