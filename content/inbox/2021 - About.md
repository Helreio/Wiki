About

Hi, I’m Vince Imbat.

I’m a writer passionate about one question: How should I live? To answer it, I study a wide variety of disciplines from different cultures and eras to collect insights about the good life. I then take walks in nature while taking pictures and pondering about the insights and the questions that brought them. Whatever I learn from these walks, I write in my note-writing system where I develop them into articles in my blog.

Living a good life is possible

We entered the world with no user’s manual for our most delicate possession: our life.

Most of us grew up in families with conflicting if not scarce advice on how we should live. Our institutions, especially our schools, do not make self-knowledge and well-being a priority. Experts and gurus are not doing much help as they peddle groundless advice that does more harm than good. It is no surprise then that despite the admirable advances in many areas of modern life, we’re not really getting happier nor wiser.

Nevertheless, I firmly believe that anyone can live a deeply fulfilling and satisfying life today. This is because we have so much wisdom and insight from ancient philosophy and modern research that we can apply to lessen our suffering and flourish into our best selves.

I consider it my calling to uncover these insights and help you understand them through my writing so you can apply them in your own life. I don’t have all the answers and I am also a work in progress, but I am excited to share with you what worked for me.

What Led Me Here

Many years ago, I had a clear vision of where I wanted to go in my life. I was a young pastor for an evangelical religion in a group specifically ministering to the Deaf. I loved serving this marginalized community, and I poured my entire soul into teaching them what I thought was the truth. My passion for “helping” them was so intense that I wanted to drop out of school so that I can focus on my ministry. That was how much I loved what I was doing. My life had its challenges, but a clear path was laid in front of me and I just had to follow. Everything I believed in was spoon-fed to me. Everything I did follow a prewritten script. I was an inexperienced 19-year-old with many years ahead of me, but I felt safe, secure, and purpose-driven.

On March 11, 2011, all of that changed abruptly. In just a few weeks, I started developing symptoms of clinical depression, which culminated in me attempting to take my own life. I took medication and stopped schooling so I can stay home and recover. It was the most painful experience I ever had to go through and its effects went beyond physical pain. The physical pain led me to question everything I used to believe about myself and the world I live in. It crushed my entire worldview: I lost my faith in God, in my childhood religion, and all sources of hope.

Standing on top of a hill one day, I concluded that life was meaningless and there was no reason to continue living. Suddenly, death seemed more desirable to me than life.

After a year of coping to live with my new reality, I felt a tiny shift within me. Whatever provoked that shift convinced me that I needed to take responsibility for my whole life moving forward. I went back to school, finished my degree, and joined social causes. While these helped me return to the real world, none gave me the same strong purpose I once had.

After graduation, I continued a near meaningless existence. During this time, I decided to deviate from conventional jobs and work from home as a writer and editor. I chose this path by intention so that I could have enough time to take good care of my health and to satisfy my intense desire to understand the world, to discern my place in it, and to answer the question I mentioned earlier: “How should I live?”

The more I followed this question, the more I embraced a creative life grounded in my sincere desire for truth, freedom, and beauty.

Slowly, I began to feel a sense of purpose and connection to the world around me again. I became deeply interested in philosophy—both Western and Eastern. I also started mindfulness practices like yoga and meditation and went on regular nature excursions. This combination of deep contemplation and direct experience made my new life more complete and enriching. It made me realize that the wisdom I could gain from self-examination transcends all the ideas I was taught before.

Much to my surprise, this realization led me to even bigger questions: What is reality? Can I know it? How can I know what is true? How should I treat my fellow human being? What constitutes a good society? How can I live a good life?

What I needed was a new worldview and way of life.

And building that worldview is my mission.

We can all live an examined life

I believe that each of us can better our lives by understanding our place in the cosmos, and this is a project too important to outsource to anyone.

Living an examined life is a non-negotiable responsibility for each of us.

Because of this, my work constitutes answering the most fundamental questions about life. I am interested in answers that are both beautiful and true. Beautiful, meaning they inspire peace, beauty, and everything that feels good. True, meaning they are based on careful and honest thinking.

I believe that a more beautiful world based on truth is possible.

In my work, I think, research, and write about what constitutes a “good life". I study a wide variety of fields—philosophy, psychology, economics, religion, art, etc.—to uncover insights about how we can be better in the things that really matter to us.

Aside from studying, I go on regular walks to marinate these insights in my mind as I commune with the physical world. Whatever I learn from studying and walking, I try to apply and share using comprehensible language. I don’t intend to convince anyone of anything. I write primarily to make more sense of the world around me.

I am doing this with the knowledge that there is no one way to live a good life. There are as many ways to do it as there are people. But there are commonalities among human experiences and we can learn a lot by studying the lives of others. That said, my work is a deeply personal project. If there is any real good I hope it can offer you, it is to inspire you to deepen your own understanding of yourself and the world around you.
