# Money is Magic

Money is magic

Magic based on agreements

Agreements can be changed

Money is seen as a protection against the infinite possibilities that can happen to an individual

But how can something that is finite address what is infinite?

Money measures

So it quantifies objects

What happens is our lives have started to embrace the things that we can quantify

Those that cant be, the sacred, are put on the side

What to do?

1. change how money is brought into being
2. Shrink the realm of money (put certain things into the commons, gift economy, things we can do for ourselves)
