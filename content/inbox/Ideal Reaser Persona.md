Who is the person you imagine speaking to in your writing?

A multi-passionate male who ultimately wants to live a vibrant creative life but is challenged by chronic illness. He also have to contend with other challenges like overwhelm, making a living

What does he or she do for a living - and why?

He is currently on a traditional job. He is an employee. But he secretly desires to have more freedom in his life because he is a creative. He wants to have more time to pursue his many passions. Because of this, he is thinking about switching into freelancing, entrepreneurship, or other less taxing job options.

What values do you and s_he share that makes him_her absolutely adore what you have to say - every tim you say it?

Gentleness and balance.

What goals does s_he have in his_her life?

His greatest goal is finally to live a vibrant creative life that is attuned with his body, mind, and spirit.

Before he gets to this end goal, he has to reach the following milestones:

First, he wants to manage his health so it will never be a problem along the way plus he wants his health to support his most important goal.

Second, he wants to create more time doing the things he loves. This involves getting into a job that allows him to have more time to do his craft.

Third, he wants to be good at his craft to the point that people will start to pay attention.

In order for him to achieve these three prerequisites, he has to develop two important qualities along the way:

First, he has to develop mindfulness, contentment, and full presence in performing his craft.

Second, he has to embrace minimalism in managing his finances and in doing his/her every day activities.

My ideal person is a Filipino who wants to do work he loves through entrepreneurship, he wants to write and get published, but he is challenged by a chronic illness - like depression - and because of this, he has to devise ways to cope so that he can pursue his goal. He has to embrace a healthy lifestyle and embrace healthy life philosophies (like minimalism and mindfulness) in order for him to succeed.

**Deep-rooted Benefits**

**Financial Benefits**

Content drive traffic to my clients’ blogs which means if they have a monetisation plan in place that’s money for them.

An ebook I create and launch for them will obviously make them money.

A beautiful website designed for the right audience will create more businesses for them.

Coaching them from the beginning until the end of launching their platform will result in a project that will earn them in the future recurrently.

**Emotional Benefits**

I emphasise simplicity in working with people so that removes a lot of stress.

I make them feel that their content is taken cared of by a seasoned and competent writer.

They are well-treated.

I make them feel like rockstars!

**Physical Benefits**

Holistically healthier overall.

**Spiritual Benefits**

They are connected to their purpose.

They are connected with their “True Self."

They are in alignment with what they believe.

They do work that gives them a measure of freedom.

They do work that is healthy for them.

They do work that allows them to explore their creativity.

Their work has a positive impact on others.
