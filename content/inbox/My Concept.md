# My Concept

Medium

Other's Concept

The medium is made up of symbols which follow certain rules. The mix of symbols and rules create your medium.

So your task as an artist is:

1. To follow your heart
2. To experiment with your content
3. To experiment with your medium

How do you go about this experimenting? Should you do a lot of projects at the same time? Focus on just one? How do you know that you are making progress
