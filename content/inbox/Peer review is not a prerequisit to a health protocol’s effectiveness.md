# Peer review is not a prerequisit to a health protocol’s effectiveness

A health protocol does not have to be in a peer-reviewed academic journal to be effective. If it is being used by doctors and it is working for them, then it could be used. If we only rely on peer-reviewed science, we are in danger of submitting ourselves to the groupthink of experts. Peer review is a highly political game where dissenting opinions are usually unpublished. This makes innovation difficult. Even if a health protocol works, if it is not approved by the powerful medical establishment, it will not gain support.

The problem is, when peer-reviewed health protocols themselves fail. This is the reason, why so many people leave traditional Western medicine in search for holistic “non-peer reviewed” approaches to addressing their health issues. Peer-reviewed sciece don’t ALWAYS work.

For an example of how this was demonstrated in Filipino national TV, see reference.
