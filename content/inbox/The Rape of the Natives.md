# The Rape of the Natives

There is a lost island in a long lost archipelago.

There’s an exclusive class of women.

Their mothers taught them about sex.

Sex is their art.

Sex gives the warrior men power in battle.

Sex give women power in all the other things that aren’t battle.

The community had to contend with scarce resources.

After a while, a boat carrying foreign men reached the island.

The men brought pigs, goats, weird creatures.

The creatures can be eaten, used to till the land, etc.

Suddenly the community saw that the foreign men possessed something that can help them till the land and eat.

The foreign men, however, seeing the beautiful women wanted to have sex with them.

The community was in a tight decision - will they offer the women?

Soon, more foreign men came. Some looked different. But all of them had creatures. All of them laughed, loud, happy.

The community began to see that there are many islands in the sea. Not just them. And all of the islands had creatures.

As men filled the island, the rice fields were depleted. The community saw that unless they took creatures they won’t be able to till the land.

The women were starving and they saw what was happening to the rice fields.

They agreed to what became the great rape.

One woman will have to have sex with thousands of men in a day.

Soon, the women were dying. They age faster when they have sex.

Until one, just one, was left. Since she was the only beautiful woman of the class left. She was regarded the most beautiful of the land.

And every day, thousands and thousands of men flock into her tent. In a line waiting to fuck her.

Slowly, she has forgotten what sex symbolized. What role it played in the old world.

When this last woman dies…what will happen?

To the community?

To the rice fields?

To the island?

To the creatures?

To all those men falling in line?
