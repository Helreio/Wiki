# Making sacred practices more sacred

Doing yoga is not whats wrong. In fact, yoga has to be there. What could be wrong is doing it within a capitalist system/culture and not caring.

How better to do yoga when money is not involved. Because you dont need money in the first place.

A better way is to do yoga AND tackle the economic environment around it at the same time.

Doing this is obviously difficult and while we could use all the time, transition towards this could take more time from most people.
