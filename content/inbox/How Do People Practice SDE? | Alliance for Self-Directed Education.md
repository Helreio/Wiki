6 Highlights from How Do People Practice SDE? | Alliance for Self-Directed Education

In order to fully engage in Self-Directed Education, school-aged children must be freed from standard, top-down, curriculum-based, compulsory schooling.

---

One is to enroll the children in a legally recognized school that’s designed to support Self-Directed Education, the other is to opt for homeschooling and then allow them to direct their own education from home. We refer to these two approaches, respectively, as school-based Self-Directed Education and home-based Self-Directed Education. The latter is often referred to as unschooling, a term coined in the 1970s by author and educational theorist John Holt.

Many self-directed learners participate in organized learning communities that are technically not schools but may be similar to SDE-aligned schools in certain ways. Often called learning centers, learning co-ops, or homeschooling resource centers, these organizations provide easy access to a greater variety of learning opportunities and social connections.

---

Whether it is home-based, school-based, or center-based, it’s important to remember that Self-Directed Education is a whole-life, freedom-based process. When children are free to learn on their own terms, they learn everywhere and all the time — not only in places and at times set aside for “educational purposes.”

---

parents and other adult helpers facilitate Self-Directed Education by providing access to resources, creating SDE-friendly environments, and engaging in authentic conversations prompted by the learners’ curiosities.

---

Self-Directed Education facilitators must shed the obsolete notion that children need to learn a standard set of skills and subjects by a certain time. Successful facilitation requires a deep appreciation for informal, spontaneous, emergent learning processes that are as natural as learning to walk and talk.
