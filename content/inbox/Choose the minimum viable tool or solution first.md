# Choose the minimum viable tool or solution first

When choosing a tool or a solution, choose the minimum viable tool that does the work then optimize. This should avoid wasting resources for unnecessary features or overkilling the problem, which sometimes could lead to more problems or risks.

This principle applies to many things like:

- Life management system
- Tackling a flea infestation
- Skin care
