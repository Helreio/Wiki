# Philosophical autobiography

What is the role of personal judgment on objective rationality in philosophy?

Philosophical autobiography is any autobiography that reveals some interplay between life, thought, and personality.

All autobiographies by philosophers are philosophical.

Speech acts

- Revealing our personality

It is inevitable in autobiographies that we reveal something about ourselves. The mere act of writing reveals personality.

When the subject of one’s writing is oneself, masking personality through formal writing is more difficult.

Revelations about a philosopher’s personality in their autobiography sheds light on how they thought as philosophers.

Connection between character and thought.

It is impossible for a philosopher to arrive at his philosophical position simply by following arguments. Personality has an influence in his choice.

“Philosophical autobiography provides strong evidence that philosophy is not a purely objective discipline, the products of which have nothing to do with the people who produce them. Philosophy is in an important sense a personal pursuit and we do not undertake it with an impersonal faculty called ‘reason’. Rather, how we reason is coloured by who
we are and the commitments we already have.”

“Work in philosophy…is really more work on oneself. On one’s own conception. On how one sees things.” (Wittgenstein)

Just because we are always influenced by personality, doesn’t mean we cannot achieve objective or strive for it.
