# There should be two realms.

The realm of OBLIGATION.

And the realm of ART.

One is not necessarily better than the other.

Both categories of actions are necessary for happiness.

The only difference is that OBLIGATIONS usually create long-term happiness.

While PLAY, because it maximizes freedom, creates happiness while it is being done.

A happy life is a life where there is balance between the two.

A happy man fulfills his obligations so that bad things don't happen in the future, which protects how he engages in PLAY.
