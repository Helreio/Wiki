# 2017b About Page

Hi there. I’m Vince Imbat. I’m a writer, researcher, and all-around explorer. I feel honored that you are visiting my personal side of the web. This website is the home of my life’s work. In my blog and email newsletter, I write about my personal journey towards a life more attuned to the natural world. I also document the Filipino journey towards “the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible.”

The central question I try to answer in my reading, writing, and daily life is: “How should we live?” This question has brought me to different places in recent years – from science, philosophy, and the arts to spirituality, traveling, and intimate conversations with people.

I document this journey in my blog and email newsletter. You can sign up below to receive my writings whenever they come out.

I don’t have all the answers and I myself am also a work in progress, but I’m happy to share what I’ve learned along the way.

## A Personal Chronicle

More than a depository of articles which I hope you’ll find useful, this website also documents four larger areas of my life.

### 1. My Personal Healing Journey

### 2. My Relationship with Money and the Market Economy

Since graduating in 2013, I’ve been in several jobs. Along the way, I have learned valuable lessons about education, work, money, and our relationship with the market economy. [Read more about my ideas on holistic economics here.](https://vinceimbat.com/sustenance/)

### 3. My Renaissance Lifestyle

Unable to settle on one career path, I’ve learned to embrace my ever-changing nature. I’ve learned later on that I’m not alone. I’ve met fellow modern Renaissance women and men who are exploring multiple disciplines and careers for a richer life.

### 4. My Personal Mission

I have always wanted to “change the world.” This brought me to evangelical and political work in the past. Today, I’ve transformed my activism. Through my research and writing, I’m exploring the potential of concepts like holism, inter-being, paradox, and nonviolence in healing society and the natural world.
