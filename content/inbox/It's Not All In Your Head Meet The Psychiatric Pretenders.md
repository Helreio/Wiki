# It's Not All In Your Head: Meet The Psychiatric Pretenders

Reversible drivers of depression, anxiety, fatigue, and brain fog

Class by Kelly Brogan

Maybe you just have a physical imbalance

Agenda

Part 1: Why aren’t we asking WHY

Part 2: The CASCADE

Part 3: Intro to PSYCHONUEORIMMUNOLOGY

The DSM

We are managing symptoms of an upstream cause we have not identified

The WHYs (highly reversible)

- Blood sugar instability
- Gluten intolerance
- Medication - PPIs
- B12 deficiency
- Thyroid autoimmunity

Blood sugar instability

Short-term gains for long-term suffering

Processed foods have sugar because it is addictive beyond comparison

Reactive hypoglycemia

- A state of anger caused by lack of food; hunger causing a negative change in emotional state
- hangry
- Your body is reacting to an unnatural stimulus
- Happens after an hour and a half when you eat something that fights your insulin

Gluten intolerance

Microbiome can digest gluten

But because microbiome is dying, gluten intolerance is rising

Our microbiome is no longer healthy because of

- Antibiotics
- Soil ecology gone
- Not born properly

What are glutenous foods

- High refined carbs leading to reactive hypoglycemia
- Processed with oxidized vegetable oils
- GMO exposure

Medication

Triggering a dangerous cascade:

stress + chemical exposures + poor diet

\-> physiologic imbalances -> medications to suppress single symptoms -> physiologic imbalances -> complex multi-system syndromes

Medications

1. Birth control
2. Statins (cholesterol medications) - most of the brain is cholesterol, if you demonize cholesterol and intervene on it, you will produce negative emotions
3. Acid-reflux drugs
4. Tylenol (over-the-counter painkillers) - numbs your ability to feel good
5. NSAIDS
6. Fluoride
7. Xenoestrogens

B12 deficiency

Thyroid

Lab tests for hypothyroidism

- Homocysteine
- hsCRP
- Fasting Glucose, Insulin, HgA1C
- Vitamin D (250H) and PTH
- B12
- ANA
- TSH, free T3, free T4, rT3, autoantibodies

Science reminds us that we will not survive without the support of our environment

Check: Alan C. Logan and Felice N. Jacka’s study

What we eat matters so much

Your body’s ability to heal is greater than anyone has permitted you to believe.
