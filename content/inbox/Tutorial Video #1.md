# Parts of an edit

## Pre-edit

1. Take note of everything that the client needs (I will talk more about this when you decide to work with me in the Scribendi system).
   1. For a research paper, this involves identifying the citation style that the client requires for a particular project, reviewing the guidelines of the academic journal that the client will be sending the article to, checking the word count requirement, etc.
   2. For an admissions essay, this involves checking the questions that the client needs to answer as well as other requirements.
   3. For resumes, just noting what the client specifically requests (if any).
2. Prepare the document itself by turning on Track Changes.

## Edit proper

### Editing a research paper

1. Start with the references and citations because these will take up most of your time.
2. Check the citation style and find good guides online.
3. Start with references, make sure that each reference entry is formatted according to the guide and each entry follows the same format for that entry.
4. Check if each reference entry was cited in the text. Depending on what citation style the client wants to use, each entry should or could be cited in the text. For example, if the paper uses American Psychological Association citation style, it is required that each reference in the References is also cited in the text and vice versa. On the other hand, some styles like the Chicago Manual of Style allows you to include in your Bibliography references that you didn’t cite in the text. However, in this instances, the place that compiles all references is called a Bibliography rather than References.
5. Do the first pass. The first pass usually requires close reading. You want to catch as much mistakes as possible. Just use your intuition. If you know something is wrong, something is wrong.
6. It is important to take note that editing is not the same as rewriting. You correct individual mistakes and rephrase individual sentences or phrases. But if you determine that the problem goes beyond one sentence and the entire paragraph is problematic, then you don’t rewrite it, you, instead comment about how the paragraph can be improved.
7. Editing is also about internal consistency. Examples:
   1. Maximum or minimum number range: 100–1 vs. 100–101
   2. Serial comma: (dog, cat and mouse) or (dog, cat, and mouse)
   3. Em dash and en dash:
8. After a first, you can do a second pass. This is sometimes necessary especially if the paper is poorly written. Usually, it can be helpful to use software to do a second pass. I use Grammarly and the Scribendi Toolbar.

### Editing an admissions essay

1. Editing the admissions essay follows almost all the rules in editing a research paper, with an emphasis on a few things.
2. The goal of an admissions essay is to help highlight a student’s strengths that fits the requirement of the school he/she is applying in. Therefore, the editing should help the student achieve this goal.
3. Important emphasis should be given in making sure that the essay prompt is really answered.
4. Usually, admissions essays have an intimate or personal element. The editor needs to help the student to not turn the essay into an overly dramatic work. There has to be a balance between academic and personal writing in an admissions essay.

### Editing a resume

1. Editing a resume is perhaps the most different of the three. It still needs the same rules applied in the two former order types.
2. But resume editing should focus on: (1) making sure that the applicant articulates their professional objective, (2) making sure that every single element of the resume supports that professional objective, and (3) fix the formatting in a resume.

## Post-edit

1. Save two copies of the file: a clean copy and a tracked copy. It's automatic to do this through the Scribendi toolbar. But there's also a manual way to do it.
2. In Scribendi, you also have to write client notes, which is basically a summary of the work you did, while emphasizing points of improvement where the client could improve their writing in.
