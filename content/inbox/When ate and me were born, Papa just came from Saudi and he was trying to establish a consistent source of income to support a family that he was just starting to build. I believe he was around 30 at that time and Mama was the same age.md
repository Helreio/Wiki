When ate and me were born, Papa just came from Saudi and he was trying to establish a consistent source of income to support a family that he was just starting to build. I believe he was around 30 at that time and Mama was the same age as I am now back then.

I remember some memories with my father. I couldn't blame him. He isn't evil. He spent time with us. Played with us.

Those games were part of my early development.

Mama on the other hand. She was more distant than papa.

The fact: I don't have (we all siblings don't have) the kind of connection with our parents that we deserve.

So when did this all started?

For mama. It was long ago.

For papa, it may have been when he started freelancing. Being a freelancer myself, knowing the emotional roller coaster, I think that got him. He was always tired, busy, distant, unreachable after a whole-day work. As he is now.

He was trying to provide for us materially. That he forgot how to develop his skills as a father, a communicator.

Whatever he left out doing, I'm still missing right now. It was my inclination to be an introvert. So this absence lead me to creativity, to exploring the confines of my young mind.

But what did I lost?

Support and encouragement to explore stuff, to be free.

What I had back then was this inclination to be open to stuff, to create, to deviate. And yet I did all these without supportive partners/ relationships.

Past relationships

- Mama
- Papa
- JW friends

I had relationships when I was younger (classmates), who supported my creativity and I really enjoyed those relationships. Right now, JV is the best example of that creative relationship that persisted, although I hope he has continued to create.

From now on, all the relationships that I will build for myself are creative relationships, that encourage the personality that I have. I will not be able to get completely lose from the old narrative that I lived in, but I can lessen its influence to me.

By moving towards my North Star, this wrong made in my past, a conjunction of accidents, may be corrected.
