# Karl Gottlob Schelle’s advise for strolling

When walking in public spaces:

- walk in wide paths that don’t get too crowded when lots of passers-by come.
- walk where the crowd is not too dense (discouraging torrent) nor too thin (curiosity about who the person is).

When walking in the countryside:

- walk in spaces where the landscape contains a variety of natural elements.

Alternate urban and country walks without favoring one from the other.
