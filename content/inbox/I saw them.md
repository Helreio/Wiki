# I saw them

Brown butterflies flying around

As the sun sets in

And the clouds gather

For yet another rain.

A flap and then

Its wings got caught

By the web

A spider spun

As it hides

Until its prey is killed

First by exhaustion.

It continued to grapple

The strongest quickest

Flapping it ever did

In its entire short life

But it stayed there

Underneath the little leaves and thorns

Of this thick brush

Its brothers and sisters

Flying around

Waiting for her to bring her own deliverance.

Afraid to come any nearer

Lest the spider's dinner

Becomes a feast.

I stood there

Patiently waiting

Trusting she can save herself

Until I couldnt

Watch no more.

I took a step

And saw that she was far

And I cant reach her by my arm

Lest I fall down the canal

So I looked down at what
