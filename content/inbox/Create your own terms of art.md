# Create your own terms of art

There will always be someone else who have already thought about a subject matter you are thinking about. Their theorizing produced their own terms of art based of their ontology. You may come to the same conclusions but adopting their system (theories and terms) entirely could be problematic because there are subtle differences. Because of this, it is better for you to create your own terms of art then when necessary [[Use bridge notes to connect your terms of art with existing ones]]
