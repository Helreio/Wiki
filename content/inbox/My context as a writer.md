# My context as a writer

I am a Pangasinense living in a Tagalog region who writes mostly in English. While I use English, my ways of talking will obviously be very different. My problems regarding self-expression are also widely different. I cannot commit to one languageâ€”let alone the rules of that language. I talk differently, use the language differently, and speak and write differently. I grew up so much in the rules of the English language that the "indigenous" seems too foreign to me and [[Decolonization can be a form of colonization itself]].
