# Spend time around people in between moments of solitude to enhance the experience

Moments of solitude seem to be heightened when we share spaces with people and consciously and intentionally spend time with them in between these moments. We can even argue that we can create rich moments of solitude while being around the right people at the same time in a sort of “alone together” arrangement.

Thoreau lived with his family and was deeply connected even when he lived in the cabin in the woods. I think that this connection with people—this integration—even if it is ambient, heightens moments of solitude. But the right people to be ambiently around is important.

Perhaps spend time in a coffee shop?

Solitude is easy for me. It is building and maintaining relationships that can be quite challenging.
