# Covid 19 treatment plan

The main substance I will base my [[Covid 19]] treatment plan will be [[Ivermectin]]. Because I weigh 85 kilos (as of 10-13-2021), my base dose should be two (2) 15 mg capsules.

To take ivermectin properly, follow these guidelines: [[Route of administration and timing for ivermectin]].

If you got exposed with a suspected Covid patient, do the following: [[Ivermectin post Covid exposure protocol]].

To treat Covid as early as possible, follow Dr. Landrito’s [[Early treatment protocol for Covid using ivermectin]].

If one week has passed since the onset of your symptoms, follow Dr. [[Allan Landrito]]’s [[Late treatment protocol for Covid using ivermectin]].

While treating yourself using ivermectin, you can also use [[Other therapeautics to treat Covid]].
