Practical Realities: Career Design for Pursuing Your Passions

FIVE

Your J-O-B: No More Day Jobs

**Why a J-O-B is Better than a Day Job**

Day Job - Something you do just for the money while you look to the rest of your life for satisfaction.

J-O-B - Only a job and more than a job. Brings money while moving you closer to a Focal Point.

**How to Pick Your J-O-B**

**Five Criteria For A J-O-B**

1. Income or benefits
2. Energy
3. Time
4. Training and equipment
5. Networking and publicity opportunities

**But What If I Have “Real" Job, Not Just A Day Job**

- [ ] If you are no longer happy with your job, convert your job/career into a J-O-B.
- [ ] Does it meet the standard of two or three of the five criteria for a J-O-B?
- [ ] Transfer your identity into your passion circle and use your job/career to support your passions.

**How To Answer The Question “And What Do You Do?"**

- [ ] Your identity must live in the Focal Points circle, not in the J-O-B circle.
- [ ] You must always answer any ritual questions regarding what you “do” in terms of one or more of your Focal Points, not your J-O-B.

**Putting The Pieces Together**

- [ ] You can put Income and Passion together
- [ ] You also can choose to keep them separate
- [ ] You don’t need to make money out of your passions

Getting Paid For Your Passions

**Getting The Job Without Climbing The Ladder**

- [ ] Exercise: Translating Your Skills Into A New Position

**Presenting Yourself To Potential Employers**

1. Learn the tribal customs.
2. Translate your resume into tribal language.
3. Avoid “skill resumes."
4. Identify common denominators.
5. Don’t apologize.
6. Mention skills that may not be mentioned in the job description.
7. Be prepared to interview with someone younger than you are.

**Option One: An Umbrella Job Designed To Feed More Than One Interest**

1. Repeated activity or set of skills that is applied in a broad variety of ways (ex: book editing, documentary filmmaking, teaching, and writing).
2. One main interest while wearing many hats.

**Option Two: Two-for-one Approach**

- [ ] For Renaissance Souls in the middle of the continuum of interests.
1. One work is an umbrella career.
2. One career remains constant.

**Option Three: Casting Loose**

- [ ] Freelancers, consultants, or entrepreneurs

But I Hate To Sell!

Success Without "Selling Yourself"

1. Distribute guniea-pig gift certificates.
2. Create your own national organization.
3. Supply a gift.
4. Combine your passions to set yourself apart.
5. Set up multiple locations.

Your Gift Is Bigger Than You Are

- [ ] The content of what we offer does not matter. What matters is that we are motivated by something bigger than ourselves. Thinking about our gift gives us the energy to move forward and do things that, if we thought of them as “sales" or “marketing," might well be beyond us. We gain freeing energy when we understand that our passions can have a positive effect on others.
- [ ] If we allow ourselves to pursue the things our Renaissance Souls want to pursue, someone else will get what his or her soul needs as well.

Time-Management Magic for Renaissance Souls

Your delight in going with the flow, in responding to what interests you at the moment, means that iron-clad daily schedules don’t work very well for you.

It’s very important for you not to micromanage your time, or to schedule yourself so tightly that you can’t respond to opportunities. You need to design your life not by the minute or hour, but by the week or month—and by what really matters to you. You need a set of strategies that will let you respond to your energies and opportunities, while preventing you from chasing a zillion rainbows at once.

**The Focal Points Notebook**

- Divide it into several sections, one for each Renaissance Focal Point.
- Jot down ideas about activities you plan to do related to your Focal Points.
- List books to read, items to purchase, calls to make, etc. for each of your Focal Points.
- Include one more section than you have Focal Points. This is where you list all the intriguing new interests you dream about. Focusing won’t make you feel that you’re permanently losing out on other possibilities.

**The Focal Points Worksheet**

- Set aside time each week to review each section of your Focal Points notebook.
- Cross completed items.
- Cross items that have become irrelevant.
- Set the most important tasks for next week.
- Set Focal Points blocks on your calendar.

Remember

- Treat Focal Points blocks as appointments.
- Schedule time for leisure and relaxation separately.
- Maintain balance among interests throughout the month

**Working With Your Calendar**

- Use a week-by-week calendar.
- Take a look at your worksheet and note which activities can be performed only at specific times.
- Remember: Renaissance Souls work best when we can match our activities to our energy flow.
- Mark your calendar with “blocks”.
- Blocks are chunks of time that are roped off for the pursuit of your chosen interests, but they do not require you to decide in advance which items on your worksheet you’ll address during these times.

**Too Little Time**

**Enjoy Your M&Ms**

- [ ] Exercise: Your M&M Worksheet

**Managing Distractions**

1. Location, location, location!
2. The NO! NO! NO! rule - anytime you find yourself doing anything but what you planned to do during this Focal Point time, you must STOP.
3. The No Exceptions! rule - make your goal realistic and practical to make no exceptions!
4. Multitask in one direction - do not multitask during Focal Point time
5. Renaissance rewards

**Live With An Abundance Of Time**

**Too Much Time!**

1. An unexpected firs step for renaissance souls
2. Four focal points plus!
3. Focal Point Edge #1: Avoiding Rut-Mode
4. Focal Point Edge #2: Being Unforgettable
