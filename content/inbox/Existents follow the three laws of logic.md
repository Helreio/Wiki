# Existents follow the three laws of logic

Existents follow [[The three laws of logic]].

Existents follow the [[The law of identity (P is P)]]: They are what they are (“A is A”).

Existents follow the [[The law of non-contradiction (P is not non-P)]]: They are not what they are not (“It is not the case that A and not-A”).

Existents follow the [[The law of the excluded middle (either P or non-P)]]: They are either what they are or not (“Either A or not-A”).
