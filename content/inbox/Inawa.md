# Inawa

Inawa is a Pangasinan word that is similar with the Tagalog_Filipino Ginhawa, which is loosely translated as "Relief" in English but means so much more than that. Inawa_Ginhawa is like an all-encompassing concept of being well in all aspects of one's life. I'm using the Pangasinan word to name this project to make it even more personal.
