Foundational question

- Is what I am hearing a sign of alarm or not?

You don’t need an accurate answer.

You don’t need to know what kind of bird it is.

Just look closer.

**Video #3 - The Bird Alarm Cues**

What is an alarm?

- Bird language is a language of emotion.
- What kind of emotion is happening to the bird?

There are a lot of gray area with alarms.

- Some are clear, some are subtle.
- A greater threat will create more alarm.
- Build confidence.

4 bird alarm cues

1. How long does the behavior list?
   1. The longer the agitation, the more likely it is an alarm (2 minute agitation is likely an alarm, a 10 second agitation is not; 10-30 minutes is certainly an alarm).
2. Do the alarms start and stop?
3. How many birds are involved?
   1. Look for many birds (2 or more)
4. What happens next?
   - A few things a bird can do next:
      - Fly down to the ground to feed?
      - Fly towards the direction it’s facing?
      - Fly away from the direction it’s facing?
      - Keeps sitting there.
   - Flies up -> Gets agitated -> Waits a few minutes -> flies back to the ground (not too worried)
   - Continues to stay alert -> Flies over a specific point in the landscape and makes alarm calls (trend for increasing intensity, alarmed)

It’s easier to know alarm if you’ve practiced watching the signs of non-alarm.
