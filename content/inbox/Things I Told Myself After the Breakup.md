# Things I Told Myself After the Breakup

Here are some things my higher self told me two years ago during one of the toughest times in my life.

“There’s just too many issues and we’re so young - I was not ready, she too - to face them effectively.”

“It was inevitable that we separate to see ourselves outside this relationship.”

“Thoughts about what I could have done, should have done, would have done, are all beside the point. What only matters is facing reality: the inevitable breakup. Grieve, learn from it, then move to a better life and better relationships.”

“You can still sleep well. You’ve been sleeping well ever since the shit happened. This means that your mind is able to recuperate. And it will continue to heal as time passes by. You are also able to *do things* - you can work, play, do self-care, think well. All of these mean that if you just continue on this path, one day everything will be alright.”

“One thing is for sure. I am only 26. A lot of things are yet to happen. One day, I will be a better and wiser person, able to see what is right for me, able to live a healthy life. When that time comes, I will be part of a thriving relationship that is able to help me withstand the storms and expand my life. One day it will come to that. But today - this is all I have - I am sad, but I have to live it like it is my last.”

“Here is something I want to promise to myself:

I will not enter or re-enter a relationship without a strong foundation.”

“I want to be in a relationship.

I want to die experiencing being a husband, a dad, a grand dad. But that dream lies on how strong a foundation I am able to build. It starts with self-love - knowing what I want and going after and finding that.”
