# On Boredom and Frustration

Why are you bored? Why are you frustrated?

Because you are not at peace with where you are right now.

Because you want to go somewhere else.

Be mindful. Enjoy every moment.

Do the journey. But enjoy going towards that goal.

One step at a time. Minimally. Incrementally. And savour the process.

Kaya slowly, minimally, one at a time, kasi para mas madali ang mindfulness
