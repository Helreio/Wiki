# While the mytric experiences he still needs to use logic to make sense of the ex

While the mysric experiences he still needs to use logic to make sense of the experience in his mind and express that experience to others.

He cant escape logic therefore he had two choices. Either he acknowledge and use the rules of logic and be rational and reject it and be irrational. If he choices to be irrational in his explanation then he shouldnt expect rational beings to understand him. If he chooses to be rational then he could still make his experience relevant to others.

He has another choice that is to shut up, be silent and not talk about his experience, thus putting his experience closer to the realm of experience. But again, he wont be able to escape his own mind asking him how to make sense of his experience in solitary inquiry. And again, he will either be rational or irrational in his interpretation.
