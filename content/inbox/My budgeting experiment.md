# My budgeting experiment

I’m going to apply [[Fitz Villafuerte’s budgeting strategy]] for a month and see what happens.

Here is my application of his strategy.

Steps

1. Work to earn 50,000 per month.
2. Upon receiving income, immediately invest 15,000 to the stock market.
3. Allot 20,000 for fixed monthly expenses.
4. Budget 15,000 for other needs and wants.

Monthly income: 50,000

Monthly expected expenses

- Rent: 7,000
- Internet: 1,690
- Water: 236
- Electricity: 500
- Mineral Water: 200
- Laundry: 750
- Meds: 610
- Dog food: 1500
- Cat food: 500
- Cat litter: 300
- Mama’s meds: 2400
- Spotify: 129
- Food: 5,000
- iCloud: 499
- Skin care: 400

Total: 21,714

What can I do to lessen this?

- Redesign eating habits and food I eat.
- Transfer to a smaller house.
- Buy a washing machine and do you own laundry.
- Ask Mama if I could lessen what I send her to just 1500.
- Delete unnecessary photos in iCloud instead of buying more storage.
