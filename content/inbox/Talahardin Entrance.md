# Talahardin Entrance

Hi! I’m [Vince Imbat](https://vinceimbat.com/). These are my working notes. I collect them in what I call my *Talahardin*, a mashup of the Filipino words “tala" (note) and “hardin” (garden)—my personal note-writing system.

I wrote these notes for myself, so they won’t always make sense to an outsider. But they are the building blocks from where [my more furnished works](https://vinceimbat.com/blog/) will be built from now on.

I started them last December 2020 after reading Sönke Ahrens’ [[_notes/02 Talahardin/How to Take Smart Notes - Ahrens]] and being inspired by Andy Matuschak's [evergreen note-writing system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be). Since then, I have made them the heart of [[thoughts/my morning writing practice]], and I'm sharing them here as a public experiment. I use [Craft](https://www.craft.do/) as my choice of app to host my notes.

There’s already quite a handful of well-developed notes in my Talakahon, but you can [[start]].

Enjoy! 🙂

\- Vince
