# Expressing vs. Marketing

In writing or any other form of art, there seems to be two categories of action involved:

1. Expressing oneself.
2. Looking for someone else who would listen to you.

These two categories of action compete for time and energy. Time spent practicing how to express oneself is time lost for looking for someone to listen to oneself.

Writers need to choose which of the two is their priority. One’s choice is influenced by a lot of things but mostly a writer’s place in his career.

Writing is not just a celebrity career, but this is how it is portrayed in our culture. We are taught that writers need many people to listen to them. And self-expression is futile and useless if no one is listening.

But writing as a celebrity career is just one way of pursuing writing. And it is a dangerous path because writers who want to be celebrities are in danger of prioritizing audience first before work. Contrast this to other professions who need to make good work first before getting attention. Why can’t writers adopt the mentality of a scientist whose main preoccupation is to contribute to a body of knowledge, not be popular?
