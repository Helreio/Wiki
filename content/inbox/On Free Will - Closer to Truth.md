# On Free Will - Closer to Truth

Everything is either

1. Predetermined (determinism), or
2. Random (indeterminism)

There is no free will.

But people feel like there is one.

Therefore, free will is an illusion.

Compatibilism

- Even if things are predetermined, you can still have free will
- You can still have free will in a world that is completely deterministic.

Libertarian response

- You still have some control to act freely

Determinism is true. But either compatibilism or libertarian is true. No free will is untrue.

Just because something is caused doesn’t mean it’s not a cause

Even if my actions are influenced by deterministic events, I have CONSCIOUSNESS PLANNING. That and the deterministic events influence what I want to do.

If consciousness is cut off the explanation of free will then free will is an illusion.

But because it isn’t, free will is not an illusion.
