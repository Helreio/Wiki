# Life is the biggest category of project.

Obviously, life ends at some point (death).

But death is not the goal of life.

Or, at least, it is not the "given" goal of life.

There is no "given" goal of life.

The goal of life is

1. Individual and therefore subjective
2. Created by the human mind and not provided by God or the Universe

I have my own purpose, which I arrived to through reason. But this is mine. It could be the same as someone else's but I am not compelled by anyone to take this as my purpose. My choice to follow this purpose is mine alone
