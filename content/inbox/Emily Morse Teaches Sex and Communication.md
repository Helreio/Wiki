# Emily Morse Teaches Sex and Communication

Sexual wellness is a pillar of our overall health.

If you don’t fulfill your sexual desire related to your authentic self, it will impact your entire life.

Decide what sex and sexuality means to you.

- What turns you on?
- What decreases pleasure in your sex life?
- What gives you more pleasure?
- What do you fantasize about?
- What are the things you think you can’t tell anybody?

Ask these questions to really understand who you are as a sexual being.

You deserve pleasure.

Talking about sex should be like talking about the weather.

# Asking for What You Want

A healthy sex life is about communication with your partner but most importantly to yourself.

Communication is lubrication.

Break the barriers to communication.

Have a healthy dialogue with a partner who is not gonna shame us, blame us, judge us—someone we feel safe with, the better sex we’re going to have.

You know what you need, but why are you not saying it?

- We're afraid they will judge or reject us.

People choose a life of unsatisfying sex rather than risk telling their partner about their authentic needs.

## Start the Conversation

Acknowledge that it is really hard.

## The Three Ts for Healthy Communication

1. Timing - Don’t do it when you are hungry, angry, lonely, or tired. Do it when you are chilling.
2. Turf - Do it in the bedroom or when you are going on a walk (it is intimate but you don’t have to make eye contact). Roadtrip (car together).
3. Tone - Be curious. Don’t attack them.

## Create a Sexual Menu

Create a Yes, No, Maybe list.

- Kissing
- Dirty talk
- Bondage
- Role-playing

Both of you can take a quiz then share each other’s results. Then see where you are both aligned.

Find what turns you on—your sexual roadmap.

## Give Your Partner Feedback

We become good at something because we prioritize it.

Prioritize pleasure.

- Talk about it.
- Give feedback to each other using the compliment sandwhich.

Compliment sandwhich

- Start with a compliment.
- Give your suggestion.
- End with another compliment

## Create a Sexual Bucket List

Write down three things you both want to try.

Swap those lists.

Have a list that contains:

- What turns you on.
- The most memorable times you had sex.
- What feels good to you.
- What’s your desires.

If you do sex similarly again and again, you won’t get the high. You will crave variety.

Even talking about our sex life might be the variety we need.

The moment you are in a relationship with someone, talk about sex immediately before everything else gets hard and awkward.

# Take Control of Your Orgasm

Each of us are responsible for our own pleasure. It is not about our partner giving us an orgasm.

- Understand what you need and what feels good.

Only 20% of vulva owners orgasm during penetration.

“Orgasm Gap"

- Penis owners take 4-6 minutes to orgasm.
- Vulva owners take 10-40 minutes to orgasm.

Occurence of orgasm during sex

- Among penis owners, heterosexual penis owners orgasm the most during sex.
- Among vulva owners, lesbian orasm the most during sex.
- In general, vulva owners orgasm less than penis owners.

When women have to touch themselves during anal sex, it is not about the men’s inadequacy. It’s just about their penis not being near the clitoris.

It’s not that we can’t have orgasm. It’s that we don’t know exactly what to do and our expectations around orgasm are completely off from reality.

## Drop Unrealistic Depictions of Sex

Using porn to educate yourself with sex could lead to “performative sex” and feeling inadequate.

We don’t see the communication and awkwardness of real sex.

## Rethinking SexEd

Should be about pleasure and how to use your body parts.

In countries where they have comprehensive sex education:

- They have less pregnancies.
- More satisfying sex of all genders.
- More equal view of sex.

Sex positivity means teaching everything about sex so that people can go out to do sex that is actually enjoyable and consensual.

Our body has all these places where we can feel pleasure. We’re walking with it all our lives and we don’t even know it.

Write your own manual of using your body for pleasure.

## Expanding Orgasmic Potential for Vulvas

Know that it is possible. You might have even scratch the surface.

Get to know your vulva.

Vulva is the parts outside of the body:

- Clitoris (has over 8,000 nerve endings; twice that of the penis) - The only reason it exists is for pleasure.
- Outer labia
- Inner labia
- Vaginal opening

Research shows that if your clitoris is more than an inch away from the vaginal opening (about a length of a thumb), you won’t have an orgasm just with penetration. Get enough clitoral contact during sex.

The clitoris actually extends internally

- Clitoral body
- Crura
- Clitoral bulbs

![Screen Shot 2021-11-12 at 1.23.23 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/166B8E2D-2BEB-4CD4-AC03-0F031D110B6A/CAE3BA20-16D5-4B49-97D6-BDDAB35A3BEC_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-12%20at%201.23.23%20PM.png)

Imagine how much pleasure is possible when you stimulate all those nerve endings.

When you stimulate these nerves, you stimulate the G-spot (which is actually a G-area).

G-Area feels like a wrinkled patch of skin 2-3 inches inside the vaginal canal towards the belly button inside of the body.

![Screen Shot 2021-11-12 at 1.31.05 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/166B8E2D-2BEB-4CD4-AC03-0F031D110B6A/7DE563E6-95DB-45EB-BF1B-F831065470FE_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-12%20at%201.31.05%20PM.png)

How to experience G-Area pleasure?

- Have clitoris orgasm to stimulate all nerve endings (encourage blood flow)
- Once the internal parts are swell, apply pressure in that area using two fingers almost like you want to pull that area outside your body, moving them rapidly.
- The sensation feels so good you might feel like you have to pee.
- You might squirt fluids from the Skene’s Glands

When we can’t have orgasm, that’s simple because we don’t have enough blood flow.

Vulva owners have quicker refractory period (time it takes to have another orgasm) to the point that they limit their orgasm because they have so much potential.

Your wetness level is not an indicator of arousal. You can be really, really turned on and not wet or vice versa.

Don’t hesitate to use lube.

80% more likely to orgasm with lube.

Use lube when you are exploring the perineum and anus.

- They are buzzing with nerve endings

![Screen Shot 2021-11-12 at 1.39.35 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/166B8E2D-2BEB-4CD4-AC03-0F031D110B6A/20F65B03-71C1-453C-BEEF-4E800ABAA54C_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-12%20at%201.39.35%20PM.png)

Become a student of your own orgasm and your body.

## Prolonging Arousal for Penises

![Screen Shot 2021-11-12 at 1.40.48 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/166B8E2D-2BEB-4CD4-AC03-0F031D110B6A/01942810-C5C6-498D-AD72-96A3504189D6_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-12%20at%201.40.48%20PM.png)

The shaft hardens when aroused because of increased bloodflow. For some, the glans is the most sensitive. For others, it is the frenulum.

For some people, stimulating the prostrate can lead to intense orgasms.

Play around.

Premature ejaculation - ejaculating within a minute or less or outside your control

### Edging technique

- When you are nearing orgasm, bring youself back to 5.

![Screen Shot 2021-11-12 at 1.46.10 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/166B8E2D-2BEB-4CD4-AC03-0F031D110B6A/8C8C66A1-CC46-4975-A236-1F3692C8BF6C_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-12%20at%201.46.10%20PM.png)

Do this a few times during ejaculation.

![Screen Shot 2021-11-12 at 1.48.17 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/166B8E2D-2BEB-4CD4-AC03-0F031D110B6A/4FAE92AD-49B8-4532-BF58-30F81C31AB2B_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-12%20at%201.48.17%20PM.png)

### Squeeze technique

When you are about the cum, squeeze the head of the penis until the moment of climax passes.

![Screen Shot 2021-11-12 at 1.50.05 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/166B8E2D-2BEB-4CD4-AC03-0F031D110B6A/82B3AB39-6CFE-4CCC-B27F-539F18A0B7CB_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-12%20at%201.50.05%20PM.png)

You can also squeeze the head of the penis and the groin simultaneously.

## The Power of the Mind

Our brain is the most powerful sex organ.

You can think yourself to orgasm. You are not limited by your genitals.

Many hormones are released during sexual play, orgasm, and after sex.

While you are being pleasured by your nerve endings, your brain releases feel good hormones.

Ocytocin - cuddle hormones

Dopamine - high

Endorphins - natural pain killers

Serotonin - mood stabilizers

Prolactin - causes sleepiness after orgasm

## Kegels: An Exercise to Deepen Your Pleasure

For vulva owners, do kegel while you are having penetration sex.

For men, it helps keep a healthy prostrate.

If you experience pain while doing Kegel exercises, check with a health care professional.

# The Power of Mindful Masturbation

Masturbation is the key to figuring out your body and what makes you feel good. It’s the roadmap.

## Masturbation is a Healthy Part of Any Relationship

A good masturbation practice is a pillar of your overall sexual health and well-being.

Masturbation makes you more confident on your body.

When you know what makes you feel good, you can communicate that to your partner.

## Mutual Masturbation

When you watch your partner masturbate, it’s hot but you also learn how your partner uses their body to please themselves.

## The Benefits of Masturbation

- Boosts immunity
- Promotes relaxation
- Releases feel-good hormones
- Improves partnered sexual play
- It’s arousing to do and witness

## Practice Mindful Masturbation

Be present. What are you noticing?

More intentional. Give space to it.

Your goal is exploration. Not pleasure.

Date with yourself.

Use sensory experience.

Seduce yourself.

- Music

Pay attention on your breath.

## Transcend Your Normal Routine

## Secondary Erogenous Zones

- Elbow
- Thighs
- Calves
- Neck

Notice what your hand feels like in those parts.

You need to do this especially when your entire sexual experience is with a partner.

Be slow so you can notice.

It’s okay if you don’t know where you’re going. There’s no orgasm.

Try different techniques. Switch it up.

Remove the need to get orgasm and just notice. You will make a discovery.

## Harnessing the Breath

Don’t hold your breath when you are going through sexual tension.

Breath well when masturbating.

Breath tells our body if we feel safe, relaxed, and ready for pleasure.

Breath is connected with blood flow and arrousal.

Deep breaths + Long exhales = Safe

Quick breaths = Excitement

## Embrace Self-love

We have “skin hunger”.

We have parts of our body that we hate. → Lead to negative self-talk.

People don’t take a look at their genitalia. You have to take a look at it.

Get a mirror and take a look during the mindful masturbation practices.

# Keeping Desire Alive

Problem: Mismatch libidos or desire discrepancy

- There is always someone in the relationship who want sex more than the other.
- The person who is rejected feels bad.

Accept that your libido will wax and wane over time.

Accept that there would be phases of attraction

- Lust phase (6-18 months): Your brain is like in cocaine.
- Lust subsides
- When lust subsides, communication should take over.
- You can go to therapy.

The challenge is how you can maintain intimacy after the lust phase.

## The Connection Between Arousal and Intimacy

William Masters & Virginia Johnson

![Screen Shot 2021-11-13 at 1.22.33 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/166B8E2D-2BEB-4CD4-AC03-0F031D110B6A/B4D18726-D040-420A-AF6B-84A17F32A60D_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-11-13%20at%201.22.33%20PM.png)

Helen Kaplan Singer

Desire is what motivates sex.

These theories suggest that arousal happens linearly

Rosemary Basson

An alternative to the linear model: Responsive Desire

- Many people start out neutral to sex.
- Desire is triggered by physical touch, affection, bonding, dirty talking, or romance.
- Sex doesn’t end because orgasm isn’t the goal.
- The vital element that powers the cycle is not desire but emotional intimacy, which makes you want more sex and connection.

We think we want sex. But what we actually want is intimacy.

In intimacy, we are truly our vulnerable authentic selves.

## Sex Begets Sex

The more sex we have, the more sex we actually want.

When it’s been a while, just get your shoe out of the door.

Just get your shoe out of the door

- Talk about sex
- Make out
- Buy a toy

It’s wrong to think that you should be “struck” by the urge to have sex with your partner all the time. You don’t get struck by the desire. You intentionally do things to generate the deisre.

Schedule sex.

## Increase Sexual Energy

Tease each other.

Do little things to tease your partner.

Have some distance.

Leave room for anticipation to happen.

Have a life with friends. Do things outside of the relationship so when you get together, you get aroused.

You can’t get aroused if you’re always on top of each other.

## The Lost Art of Kissing

Try different ways of kissing.

1 million+ nerve endings are stimulated when kissing

Use

- Tongue
- Salive
- Moaning

Kiss neck, face, all over.

In a lot of long-term relationships, kissing is the one that goes first.

You can learn how to kiss better together.

Have a game

- I'll show you how I want to be kissed.
- Show me how you want to be kissed.
- Make an amalgamation of how you both want to be kissed.
- Make your own kissing.

## Sharing Fantasies

Two kinds

1. Daydreams
2. You actually want to experience

When you tell it to your partner, don’t jump right to the fantasy. Your partner may not feel the same way about it.

Conversations about sex are a dialogue. You don’t have to tell all the details. You can make it a general theme at first.

Ask: What are your core erotic themes?

Popular erotic themes

- Group sex
- Sex outdoors
- Watching people have sex
- Being watched or on display
- Having sex with a stranger
- Dominant and submissive scenes
- Bondage
- Role-play

Talking about fantasies are a delicate thing because we are not used to talking about sex in the first place. Keep it in your mind that they may thing they are inadequate.

- Reassure them: I love you and our relationship so much that I want you to be part of this fantasy.

### Create a fantasy elevator pitch

Make it a minute or less. Practice it.

Share the fantasy and then ask what do you think about it?

Sometimes it’s just easier to just let it out.

Think: Who, what, where (you want it to happen or where you first saw it), when (since when did you have it), why (why is it important to me)

### Tips for handling fantasy rejection

- Reassure your partner that they are ultimately who you want
- Show appreciation for their honest response
- Ask if there is a compromise or where the boundary exists for your fantasy
- Let the conversation rest awhile before revisiting
- Remember, not all fantasies need to be acted out for enjoyment

# Practice Consent and Safer Sex

## It All Starts With Consent

Consent

- Clear
- Coherent
- Willing
- Ongoing

You can change your mind every time.

Consent can be hot.

Consent is about reading body language.

- Read the cues.
- Be observant of what is happening with your partner.
- Set clear boundaries and expectations.
- Then play within the areas allowed.

The Power of No

- No simply means I don't want to engage in this sexual activity.
- It doesn’t mean you are bad or I am not attracted to you.
- No is just a boundary.
- When we know the rules of the game (what is on the menu and what is not), we can play so much better.
- Every week we can put on something new in the menu. We have something to look forward to.
- When you have healthy conversations about it, you anticipate what kind of sex you will have.
- When you talk about it enough, later body language is enough to tell each other what each other needs. It becomes a little secret language.
- When you are in a short-term relationship, this is where there needs ongoing consent.
   - Don’t make assumptions. More care, time, and attention.

When a partner is not enthusiastic, they might be:

- Pulling away
- Freezing
- Rushing to get it over with as quickly as possible

When you see these reactions, you need to talk about consent.

How to check in:

- Pause all activity. Tell them what you noticed.
- Ask: “How does this feel for you?"
- Ask: “Would you like to keep going, change it up, or stop altogether?”
- If you are the one who doesn’t feel good, trust your gut. Take a pause and say no.

## Practicing Boundaries After Trauma

You need an understanding partner.

Then tell them what you need to support you in the trauma.

If your partner truly loves you, they will respect your boundaries.

Be your own advocate for healthier sex by using your words and learning to communicate.

## Practice Safer Sex

Use condoms to protect you from unwanted pregnancies and STDs.

Try out different condoms to find something that feels good.

## How to Talk About STDs

Practice conversations ahead of time.

Both get tested.

Talk about your diseases.

### How to Practice Safe and Consensual Sex

- Make consent top of mind during sexual interactions.
- Talk about your sexual health with your partner.
- Research proper barrier methods.
- Advocate for STI testing with your physician.

# Fun Ideas to Enhance Your Sex Life

## Destigmatize Kink

Kink is just another way to explore what feels good. It’s not weird.

BDSM

- Bondage
- Discipline
- Sadomasochism

Everything is kink outside missionary.

Open your mind to the possibility that more pleasure can be had.

## Exploring Sex Toys

Toys can intimidate partners esp. guys.

Sex toys are just an enhancement. You can think of it as a threesome.

Be open to the fact that there are different ways of having an orgasm, like different recipes in a menu.

Sex toys are just dessert.

They help give variety.

Sex toys help us feel other sensations like pain or increase blood flow in parts.

Penis rings.

Suctions

Explore sex toys alone or with a partner

Help you feel things you have never felt before.

There are even remote control toys.

PWDs can use toys to feel pleasure and feel connected with partners.

Can I have too many toys?

- No. They're all different. You are doing them for pleasure.

## Oral Pleasure Tips

### For Vulva

​Tease the labia.

Lick the clitoris. Circular motions.

You can also use your fingers to stroke.

Ask if she wants a finger or two inside her.

Try reach the G-Area

Use toys

Go slow. Pay attention to how they react to what you are doing.

Don’t just focus on the clit. There are so many nerve endings.

### For Penis

1. Use your hand esp. when you are tired. Twist your hand. Bring your hand to your mouth. Use both mouth and hand following each other. Use both hands.
2. Lubricate using lube or saliva. Tease the frenulum using the tongue
3. Hold the balls. Ask.
4. Eye contact. It can be a very connected intimate experience.

### Beginners Guide to Anal Play

Touching

Rubbing

Licking

Penetrating

Internal pleasure

- Prostrate
- Clitoral nerves
- G-Area

Sex is messy. It’s not always clean.

Prepare. Ideally, you have moved your bowels.

If it becomes messy, put a towel and throw at the washing machine.

Avoid going from anal play to vaginal play.

- Even a little fecal bacteria can cause infection.

Take it slow.

See how it feels.

Use fingers first rub it around.

Then put fingers inside.

Make sure your nails are clipped, clean, and manicured.

Use lube (silicon lube) in any anal activity because the anal is not self-lubricating.

For vulva owners, engage in anal after doing vaginal. So you are already turned on. Then breath. You have to relax. Release the tension. When you are tense, it gets painful.

If you are putting something in your anus, it has to have a flared edge so it won’t get stuck.

## Prostrate Play

It is men’s G-Area

Put a finger inside your anus. You will hold a hard part.

You can have orgasm here without ejaculation.

## Experiment with Sex Positions

Thoughts

- I might need a new place: A place where I can be freer sexually.
