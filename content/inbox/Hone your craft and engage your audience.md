# Hone your craft and engage your audience

According to [[Dan Blank]], to be a gateway for people to experience something they are looking for which you can provide, focus on these two actions every day:

1. Hone your craft ([[thoughts/my morning writing practice]]).
2. Engage with your audience one-on-one ([[Strategy for Connecting]]; [[Slow connecting for introverts]]).

A simple routine to apply this is to write in the morning and connect with people in the afternoon ([[My daily routine]]). This is quite similar to John Watersâ€™ routine, which I read [[Austin Kleon]] quote several times. He makes stuff in the morning and sell them in the afternoon.

Doing my craft in the morning, which involves both writing and studying, has the added benefit of being able to exercise my thinking and writing before I engage with intelligent people in the afternoon.

To do

- Ask: Has this really worked for me? Or is daily connecting too much to me?
