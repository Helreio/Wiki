# On what kind of wedding we want

Lea asks what we should do if ever her mom wants us to have a Christian wedding. I said I do not want that and I will have to talk with her mom about it.

That said, I did raise the issue of whether there is an agnostic minister who officiates marriages in the Philippines.
