# Practical alternatives to morality

One way to distance ourselves from morality is to cutback on our use of moral language. Instead of telling others about their moral obligations, tell them what “you” want them to do. You can also express annoyance, anger, and enthusiasm, which affects what people do without using morality.

Life can be better, even healthier, without morality. We don’t need a fiction to live a better life.

Abolishing morality could help us achieve the goals that moral realists ([[Moral realism]]) and fictionalists want to achieve.

Alternative choices to morality are:

- [[Assertive moral fictionalism]]
- [[Nonassertive moral fictionalism]]
- [[Moral abolitionism]]

Furthermore, since we don’t act based on morality, [[We act based on practical rationality]].
