# An almost perfect day

This is an almost perfect day.

No putrid smoke.

Just fresh clean air.

No disturbing noise.

Just delicious silence.

A little heat in the morning.

And cold in the evening and late afternoon.

Beautiful.

Ordinary days.

Parts and parcels of life.

Life that is rather meaningless.
