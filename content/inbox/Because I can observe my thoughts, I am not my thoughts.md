# Because I can observe my thoughts, I am not my thoughts

When I meditate, I notice that I have thoughts that come and go without any conscious effort. These are [[Unconscious thoughts]]. They seem to come and go as they please. I may stop them from taking over me but I cannot control when they would start to come.

Being able to talk about and describe them suggests that there is a distinction between what is being watched (the unconscious thoughts) and that who watches.

I feel like I am the one who watches.

Questions

- There are unconscious thoughts but how about conscious thoughts? Am I still watching them?
