# Everyone engaged in spiritual and religious talk needs to train in philosophy

Everyone engaged in spiritual and religious talk needs to train in philosophy. They are unaware of it but a lot of what they are doing is actually philosophizing. Theology branches out of philosophy and not the other way around. The moment you make a claik like God exists, Energy exists, you automatically speak a philosophical language since you are making a truth claim. Therefore you are not exempted from philosophical scrutiny.
