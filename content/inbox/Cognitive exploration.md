# Cognitive exploration

Cognitive exploration has two parts

1. Openness to experience (I think this is also related to the [[VIA Character Strenghts Survey]] strength of [[Curiosity]].
2. Intellect

What the two does is similar to the [[convergence–divergence model of creativity]]. Openness to experience motivates us to explore stimuli. Intellect prevents us from getting lost in stimuli by fostering focus.

The model also seems to be applies in the relationship of cognitive exploration itself with [[thoughts/purpose]], which are both in the [[Growth]] section of [[Maslow’s heirarchy of needs]]

I have high oppenness to experience and intellect, which is an advantage in any creative field. That said, I notice that I have less aesthetic skills and the fine arts does not really appeal to me. Perhaps because it relies a lot to [[Sensation-seeking]], which I am poor at.
