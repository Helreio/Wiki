# Ways to prioritize process over product

To prioritize [[thoughts/process over product]], do the following:

- Design [[My daily routine]] in a way that has a right balance of intense focused creative work, socialization, play, rest, and mindfulness training.
- Design [[thoughts/my morning writing practice]] using workflows that are easy and enjoyable to do ([[Talahardin]], progressive summarization, intermediate packets, etc.).
- Ensure that I am [[Connecting]] with people who spark creativity and joy in me every day.
- [[Only consume information that is relevant to your purpose]] and that spark creativity and joy.
- Put myself in environments that nurture creativity and joy (a great room, etc.) ([[Enhance the experience of a mental state by modifying the environment]]).
- Do fieldworks because [[Walking accomplishes multiple goals]].
