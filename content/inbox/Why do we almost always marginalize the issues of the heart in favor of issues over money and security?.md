# Why do we almost always marginalize the issues of the heart in favor of issues over money and security?

We want to talk about reproductive health and abortion but we keep ourselves silent on subjects of dating, marriage, building a family, and (for God's sake) heartbreak!

And because we have avoided such subjects, they have become prey to the often biased and small-minded opinions of tv shows, pastors, and radio hosts!

But why the disconnect
