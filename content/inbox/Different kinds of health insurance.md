# Different kinds of health insurance

1. Prepaid - cheap and covers you in a set of time (1 year)
2. HMO insurance -
3. Critical insurance - covers you whole life, 65, 75, 100, etc.
   1. Term
   2. Renawable (increase year by year)
   3. VUL - when fund turns zero, plan gets cancelled (you will pay more)

Coverage amount selection: 3 million

Payment terms selection: 10 years (annual payments)

- Because after 10 years, I might no longer be productive and can no longer pay.
