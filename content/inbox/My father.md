# My father

Trees

God/Nature

I talk to you but you don't speak

You speak to your other children but not to me

What wrong did I do?

You brought me into this life

It was not my choice

And you force me to honor you

As if my life depends on it

You feed me

Nurture me

And you think it is enough

When all I need is someone

To ask me about my dreams,

Thoughts,

Poems
