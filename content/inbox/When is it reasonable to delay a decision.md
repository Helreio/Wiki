# When is it reasonable to delay a decision

It is reasonable to decide to hold out on making a decision when the following things are happening:

1. I don't have enough certainty to warrant an action.
2. I don’t have time yet to increase that certainty.
3. Events and my environment have not yet reached the point where I am forced to make my decision or collect information to increase my certainty.

Holding out means:

1. I wait until my certainty levels increase
2. I wait until my environment and events around me force me to hasten my decision-making.
3. I make time off from my daily life to make a decision.

The process is as follows: Environment pressure → Making time → Certainty level goes up → Decide
