# I think that the best lifestyle for me is the lifestyle of Buddhists and people in the spiritual path.

What I can't accept is to call it spiritual.

I will live a life of mindfulness while maintaining philosophical honesty.

It is possible.

Strive for all my actions to flow from this inner stillness.
