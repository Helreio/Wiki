Buy a brush for Kako.

Brush Kako at least once a week or more often if her coat is long.

The goal is to get Kako live for up to 17 years.

Walk Kako at least 2-3 time for 30 minutes or longer.

Always have someone at home with Kako.

How to bath Kako

1. Never use human shampoo.
2. Brush her hair and remove any debris, knots, or tangles.
3. Place cotton balls in her ear canal to prevent water from going in.
4. Use lukewarm water.
5. Wet her coat until skin.
6. Do not pour water over her head and eyes. Use a sponge to wet this head area.
7. Apply shampoo from the head to back. Avoid getting the shampoo to her eyes, nose, mouth, or ears. Do not miss the areas under the legs and tail.
8. Rinse. Make sure no shampoo is left as this will cause irritation.
9. Apply conditioner (ideally “leave-in” no-rinse formula).
10. Dry her using a towel. Gently squeeze any remaining water out.
11. Use a hair dryer to dry her faster. Put your hand between her hair and the hair dryer.

Ear care

1. Make a mixture of 50:50 hydrogen peroxide and purified water.
2. Use cotton to wipe her ear.
3. Make sure they are dry after cleaning.

Eye care

1. Remove the buildup of secreations in her eye using a warm, damp cloth

Nail care

Dental care

- Brush Kako’s teeth every day in the night before bed time.
- The pain associated with periodontal disease will make your dog’s life miserable, as it will be painful for them to eat and the associated bacteria can infect many parts of the dog’s body, including the heart, kidney, liver and brain, all of which they will have to suffer in silence.
- Scrap plaque build up in her teeth.
- Buy an electric tooth brush for Kako.
- Buy a dog tooth paste for Kako.
- Feed her large natural, hard bones at least once a month.
- Feed her daily dental chew.
- Incude coconut oil to her dinner.

How to train her with brushing

1. Apply canine toothpaste manually to her teeth with your finger.
2. Use a soft bristled toothbrush to brush the toothpaste.
3. Be gentle. Do it slowly to avoid gum bleeding.

Brushing and combing

Brushes

1. Soft bristle brush - Use this to remove loose hair, dirt and debris while gently stimulating the skin, improving circulation and adding shine to the coat.
2. Slicker brush - Use this to remove mats and tangles, and as a finishing brush after the use of a pin brush to smooth the dog’s coat and create a shiny finish.
3. Pin brush (with rubber tip)
4. Metal comb
5. Flea comb - Use this to remove fleas.
6. Mat splitter - Use this to split matted hair. It has three types: letter opener, safety razor style, and the curved blade style

Keep a quality pair of scissors.

Other tools

1. De-tanglers - removes mats easier (alternatively, use corn starch before bathing).
2. Styptic powder - use this when accidentally cutting into the vein of your dog’s toenail (alternatively, mix baking soda and corn starch or corn starch alone).
3. Ear powders - apply this after washing the inside of her ears.
4. Ear cleaning solution - 50:50 organic apple cider vinegar and purified water; 50:50 hydrogen peroxide and purified water. Thoroughly dry their ears after cleaning.
5. Paw cream - Put these right after clipping their nails.

Alternatively, ask mama to canvas for dog groomers and ask how much they cost. If you opt with this, have Kako groomed every 6-8 weeks.

Consider spaying as it has many benefits for a dog’s overall health.

Vaccination

Boost the DAPP every three years. More frequent than that and it is over vaccinating.

Deworm dogs every 6-12 months.

Pet insurance

Questions to ask:

- Is your dog required to undergo a physical exam?
- Is there a waiting period before the policy starts?
- What percentage of the bill does the insurance company pay — after the deductible?
- Are payments limited or capped in any way?
- Are there co-pays (costs to you up front)?
- Does the plan cover pre-existing conditions?
- Are chronic or recurring medical problems covered?
- Are fees higher depending on the breed of dog?
- Can you choose any veterinarian or animal hospital?
- Are prescription medications covered?
- Are you covered when traveling with your pet?

(If Kako starts to have severe illness, I will not hesitate to get her here in LB to get the care she needs).

What to do during reverse sneezing

- Calm them
- Rub their nose (this will open their mouth and breath normally)
- Give their chest a quick little squeeze on either side to force air out of their lungs
- Lightly blow air into their face

If they have a breathing problem, avoid exercising them in hot weather

Food

- Avoid foods with high amount of grains and fillers
- Choose foods that have high quality meat protein
- Feed them whole, unprocessed, species-appropriate food with the main ingredient being meat
- Raw food sold in pet stores is safer than raw meat bought in grocery stores

# To dos

1. Ask mama to canvas for dog groomers and ask how much they cost.
2. Research if Kako needs pet insurance.
