# Bonus: How to Preserve the Quality of Your Photos

# The 5 Most Common Ways People Lose Image Quality

1. Emailing photos to each other.
2. Using social media site.
3. Using messaging apps.
4. Saving photos as sceenshots.
5. Using poor quality photos app.

Camera+ method

- Use it to check the resolution and file sizes of your photos.

Steps

1. Import photos you want to check on the Lightbox of Camera+

By default the newer iPhone models take 12 MP photos. If you haven’t cropped a 12 MP photo, it wil have a default resolution of 4032 X 3024.

For JPEG photos, 3MB is more or less the file size you should expect.

If a photo has these stats, there is no problem in the photo and it is good.

iPhone 6 takes 8 MP photos.

Things that lessen a photos quality:

- Taking photos using older iPhones (8 MP or below).
- Cropping images significantly.
- Compressing images.

An image with 4 MP and 0.5 mb can still be printed but should be small.

Resolution and compression are different.

If a photo has a bigger file size, it has more details and has better quality.

What to do if your photo lost quality somewhere:

1. Check the resolution and file size of the original undedited photo.
2. If you used different apps to edit, look at each app to find the culprit.

How to prevent losing quality

- Use iCloud and set it up correctly.
- Use Airdrop to transfer photos to someone.
- Use cloud storage services (iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox).
- Use a memory stick or external hard drive.
- Check the setting of the apps you use and set them as high as necessary.
- Everytime you use an app, check the quality of the photo before using the app and after using the app.

# Shooting and Editing RAW iPhone Photos

You can use the Camera+ app to shoot photos using the RAW file format.

Shoot RAW photos only when you are dealing with scenes that have a high dynamic range (high highlights and low shadows) or if the exposure is tricky.

# How to Prepare Your Best iPhone Photos for Printing

Understand aspect ratio. Aspect ratio of print should match your photos.

## Aspect ratio

Aspect ratio is the ratio between the width and the height of your image.

Your photos should have the same aspect ratio as your prints.

If you don’t do that, the printer technician will crop your image.

For easy remembering: Take the bigger number and divide it by the smaller number.

Common aspect ratios

- 6:4 = 1.5
- 10:8 = 1.25

iPhones take photos on 4:3 aspect ratio. The standard print for this aspect ratio is 4” x 5.3”.

How to make sure if the photo you have is big enough for your print in mind?

If the image file is less than 1 MB, it will usually not work great as a print.

The official way to determine how big a print can be involves DPI (dots per inch).

300 DPI (300 pixels for every inch) for small prints that will be viewed up close.

How many pixels do you need to print a photo that is 4 x 6”?

- Height: 4 inches x 300 DPI = 1,200 pixels (minimum height in pixels)
- Width: 6 inches x 300 DPI - 1,800 pixels (minimum width in pixels)
- 1,200 x 1,800 pixels is the minimum pixel requirement for a 4 x 6” photo

For 12 MP photo (the photo taken by iPhone), the larges you can print is 10 x 13.4” (not big).

What is the minimum DPI for big prints?

- Talk to your printer.

If you need to upscale your photo for it to have more pixels, use Big Photo. Articially increases the resolution of your photo. But it’s not a miracle cure. It looks bad usually.

How to edit photos for printing

Be mindful of the mistakes in the photo (both raw mistakes and edits).

Edit your photo subtly. Edits get amplified in print.

Also, screens have backlits. Prints do not. Prints tend to be tiny bit darker than original digital versions. Increase brightness a bit before sending to a printer.

Sharpen your photos before printing. Don’t get higher than 20%.

- If you sharpen, grain gets more.
- Sharpen only as a mask to select areas. Do not sharpen sky and water.
- Do not sharpen portraits.
