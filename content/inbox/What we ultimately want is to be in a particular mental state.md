# What we ultimately want is to be in a particular mental state

We don’t want physical objects. We want the [[Mental state]] we get by having those objects.

We don’t want the status that people see. We want the mental state of having that status that we alone can see.

What we desire is to revisit a mental state we experienced in the past and which we know is desirable. So, when asked, “What do you want?” our first answer is almost always not the true answer. The true answer is usually behind that first answer or way back.

What do you have to do to be get want you want? [[You act to get what you want]].
