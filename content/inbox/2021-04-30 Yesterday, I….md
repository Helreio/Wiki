Yesterday, I...

ate my second *halo-halo* of this season—a cornocupia of ice, dominated by *pinipig*, and occassionally disrupted by the transiently sweet taste of pink *sago*. Crushing the ice was easier than I expected. The ice of this street *halo-halo* was interestingly softer than those I used to bulldozed in Pangasinan. Yup, I used to shovel those *halo-halo* up before I could mix them. And unless they're mixed, you can’t really eat them. Or, I mean, you can. Leche flan first. Then the ube. Then the melon. But, that's not *halo-halo* anymore. That's *isa-isa*.

When I visited Malaysia, about four years ago, I remember praising our *halo-halo* over their local *cendol*. For me, it was a no-brainer. And this was despite all the things I praised about Malaysia over the Philippines: their transportation system, their publishing industry, their sanitation. None of those could justify me picking the *cendol* over the *halo-halo*. Our *halo-halo*—whether street or Chowking’s or Razon’s—was too unique a symbol and a taste to put below the *cendol*, which is by the way also found in almost all other Southeast Asian countries, not just Malaysia. So, why did we ended up calling ours *halo-halo* while everyone around us called theirs *cendol*? Because history. While *cendol* traces its roots way back to ancient Java, the *halo-halo* can only make claims of its existence as far back as pre-WWII, among the Japanese who brought it here to us.

Like a lot of things I see around my visual periphery, the halo-halo is foreign too.

Like I am to Los Baños. Like the language I am using to write this now.

But fuck “foreign” and “local” and all the emotional baggages that come with this dichotomy. I am a citizen of the world.

These are all mine now. I own them as much as their original owners.

This is “my” *halo-halo* and not even a history lesson will change that.
