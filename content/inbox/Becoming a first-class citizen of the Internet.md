# Becoming a first-class citizen of the Internet

your ability to process and manage the information flowing around you is the biggest bottleneck to whatever you want in life.

information is like light: your ability to sense it, to make sense of it, and to decide what it’s telling you is like the ability to see.

everything that is hard to do is only hard because of uncertainty.

If you knew exactly what to do, how to do it, and when to do it, wouldn’t you just take one decisive action after another until it was finished? Concepts like procrastination, distraction, and indecision are just symptoms of underlying uncertainty.

I want to tell you what I concluded after that experience: that I would never rely on my own brain and body for my quality of life. I’m thankful for that experience now, because that decision has served me so well. It’s allowed me to grow a business while maintaining my peace of mind. It’s allowed me to take on big creative projects while staying balanced and healthy.

it allows me to be present and to take each day one at a time, because the systems I’ve created are like a buffer against reality. I can manage the chaos and complexity in my Second Brain, and that is what allows me to sleep at night.
