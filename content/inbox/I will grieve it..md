# I will grieve it.

Every day until it's over.

But I will also build the better life.

Waiting for me.

Day by day.

Hour by hour.

Ginhawa is the guide.

This is my journey.

I will take care of my mental and physical health.

I will build great relationships with family and friends.

I will master my economic existence.

I will pursue what I am called to do.

I will pursue the things that make me feel alive.

I will find the person I will be spending the rest of my life with.

A monogamous long-term relationship is what I want.

I will build a family of my own.

I will get there - the better life waiting for me.

And I will get there by following Ginhawa - what makes me feel good, what makes me feel inner peace, every single day.
