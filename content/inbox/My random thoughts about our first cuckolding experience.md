# My random thoughts about our first cuckolding experience

I like it. I just dont want to be constantly disturbed by it

The frequency of things like these can’t be often. They disrupt my flow of thought, which is essential to my lifework.

I dont want it to be a joke

I cant put this center stage because it is not where i am happiest. My turf is on heavenly things

I was jealous about

- Him convincing you that you like to get eaten out.
- You two taking a bath together.

It was a mistake because it was rushed.

Please understand that we will be talking about this more in the coming days. Because I have inner work to do. I realized i have a lot of baggage with this (because of watching porn with the wrong messages, being a jw, being cheated by my ex but actually wanting it).

All I ask for u is to be patient with me and to hear me and engage with me when I tell u something I realized. This is a very healing process i am going through right now.

Look, it's done. I can no longer do anything about it. It was a mistake. Since it was a mistake, and I can't do anything to change it, I should love it. Amor fati. And see what good I can get from it: lessons for next, motivation to love Lea more, and source of arousal of course.

This is just 5% of our relationship. We're 95% a normal couple.

Message to Lea

Ultimately, I think it was a mistake. I think I hurt myself. But we can no longer change what happen. The best thing I can do is to extract what is good.

I'm probably a dominant cuck. I like girls who are not as dominant as I am. I like saying what they do. I don't like the bull to get ahead of me in terms of things to do. I want to be the first. I want to feel that I am still ahead even if Iet my parner get fucked.

Lea had fun. And it was natural for her to have fun. It would have been abnormal if she had not. This kink is not just about me. It is about her as well. From this unselfish exploration comes trust and satisfaction in our partnership. If I am the only one being pleasured, and she isn’t, then we shouldn’t do this again.

I need to accept the fact that I cannot provide her with everything she needs physically. That’s just impossible. I shouldn’t be jealous that someone else could satisfy her physically. What I should be jealous about is if someone else satisfies her need for understanding, kindness, and vulnerability.

It is okay that I have a small tool, because despite that, I am still sexually pleasurable to women—to Lea especially. On top of that, I have this kink that makes me more open to share her to have fun than the normal dude.
