# She left me.

She was the closest person to me.

She was my bestfriend.

But she left me.

It was dysfunctional.

But it was everything I have.

And I miss my baby badly.

I miss her so bad.

She's no more.

Like a person who died.

All the mornings and breakfasts.

All the evenings and dinners.

The movies.

The little things.

They're all gone.

I was alone then.

Even when I was with her.

But I am more alone now.

I have nothing but myself.

And I am alive.

I havent hurt myself.

I have not killed myself.

But I am living like a corpse.

When i remember that I am now alone.

The 6-year journey was over.

It is over.

It is over.

It is over.
