# Consumption and not the accidental class system should be at the center of the social justice debate

The intentions of the rich for themselves and for their families is not bad. We cannot use these as objective standards for moral behavior in this problem.

What is at the center of the social justice debate is consumption.

Even if the rich was born rich and the poor, poor, is it morally right that they consume what they consume? Possess what they possess? Is consumption and possession of things that is more than what is objectively, reasonably enough, tantamount to stealing? Is rejection of the interconnected nature of things that exist in the physical world, morally wrong?
