# How to Find the Frontier of Knowledge - Samo Burja

The ultimate test of knowledge is “Is it practical? Can it be practically applied?”

Fields have not yet been fully defined. We have not yet exhausted the possible intellectual questions we can ask that are worthy of years of study.

Academia rewards small breakthroughs, not large, productive exploratory hypotheses.

To define a new field, you have to do large, exploratory hypotheses that reinterprets previous data.

Crackpot does not carry the stigma that it is wrong. The stigma that it carries is that the person is an outsider, that their knowledge even if it is correct has no bearing in the world.

The first step in a practical epistemology is to decide, “Is the field you are interested in working already crystallized perhaps under a different name?”

If you are motivated by knowledge itself, you just want the actual subject matter, not the title.

Where would be easiest to study? Where would you be both the best informed by an existing tradition of knowledge with useful concepts and have the freedom to make your own additional contributions?

It is possible that a field was misnamed.

A lot of people are already generalists. They are writers, economists, or philosophers.

Philosophy is gate-kept.

Writer is not.

It is possible to get away without a phd as an economist.

Where can you find frontiers of knowledge?

If the field has crystallized, then it is in a recognized institution.

- Is the institution functional or has it grown dysfunctional? If it has grown dysfunctional, you will have a negative experience trying to advance knowledge further because the stated mission of the organization and the actual discovery of new knowledge are incompatible priorities.

Communities of practice

- Driven by an economic niche or a social niche
- All niches are socioeconomical
- There is no such thing as a subculture with no economic consequences or economic processes, and there are no economic processes without social processes.

Exceptionally talented thinkers, masters of their craft

- Try and learn from them directly
- Send them a cold email
- Edit their paper or co-author a paper while giving them the lion’s share of the paper while you get the lion’s share of the learning.

Steps

1. Evaluate institutions
2. Evaluate the sociological reality of the institutions
3. Then choose whether to institutionalize yourself (community of practice or join an institution) or apprentice yourself

If you are an asset, they will invest in you. If you are a competitor, they will not invest in you.

Doctoral systems are a fraud because doctoral adivsors do not have a personal carrer stake on the success of their own students. They must have a reward for what they do.
