# Grow Your Audience

# *Introducing the GYA process*

Hard work is not enough.

The work has to be:

- Smarter
- More focused
- Has to work towards a larger measured goal

Product failures happen because trust is not established with the target audience.

Offering services is a perfect way to research what your target audience needs which you might be able to solve through a product later on. Transform what you learned one-on-one into a one-to-many solution.

You can use a service as a beta test to the product that you want to create.

You don’t have to start with services but services can provide you research and revenue faster (which you can use to fund your product development).

# *What you need to know about trust marketing*

“If you’ve created something you believe in, you shouldn’t be ‘above’ marketing it.” (Sarah Von Bargen, Yes & Yes)

Marketing efforts can fail if trust isn’t factored in.

If you want to get ahead of 99% of solo businesses, you need a solid marketing plan build on trust.

You need a plan or process to act on, not just goals.

Marketing plans need to be measured to be effective.

What is trust marketing?

- It means that a group of people trust you enough to invest (with their: attention, email addresses, or dollars).
- It requires you to keep promises and engage in consistent two-sided honest dialog.
- It begins the second you have an idea for a product, not when you have a product to sell.
- It needs to be measured at every step.

Trust marketing is a process that a sustainable and manageable growth for your business in a way that suits who you are and how you work.

Remember, results aren’t ever instant. Work the process, continue to measure and refine it, and you should see it pay off.

Start a spreadsheet that tracks what customers and non-customers are saying about your brand and product.

- This will show where trust is lacking.
- Will show how people are describing things, then use that language in your own content to illustrate empathy.

# *How to shape your perception*

Your perceptions sentence is your personal tagline.

Standout and make your personality distinctive by just being you.

Repetition of your perception means people need to see your personal tagline everywhere they hear your name

Do you have a “name” for your processes, methodologies, or solutions?

Test your perception sentence by saying it when people ask what you do.

How do you feel when you say your perception sentence?

# *Understand that SEO is about asking and answering questions*

In SEO, a tide rises all ships.

Link to sites like wikipedia.

There’s no way to game SEO.

Edit meta title and description to better answer what people are asking in search engines.

Use Twitter card

# *Implement tracking code for your website*

For your top pages in GWT, include a signup form or link to other pages so that other pages usage rate will increase.

---

# *How to turn your website into a conversion machine*

You want people in your email list because it’s easier to turn subscribers into buyers instead of visitors into buyers.

For social proof, add:

- Embedded tweets
- Testimonials
- Video testimonials
- Case studies
- Success stories

Negative social proof include

- Small number of comments -> remove comments
- Small number of shares -> remove number of shares in your share buttons

About page

- Not about you
- It’s about who you are as related to how you are going to help your audience
- Always have an opt-in here
- Requires a professional photo

Newsletter page, add this to:

- Menu
- Social bio
- Guest posts

Trust is built when people see a human face, so use a photo of yourself.

Too many items in the menu leads to analysis paralysis.

---

# *Learn the lasso technique to build your audience*

Don’t be dismayed if people you reach out to say no.

- Relationships take time.
- Their no might only mean “not right now."

---

# *Develop anirresistible carrot to get more subscribers*

Use Google Adwords to determine what your audience are searching for that landed them on your site. Package the answer into a reason to signup.

Test one carrot for a month then another. And see which makes better.

- If they are not performing for at least 5%, change the wording or change what the offer is.
- You are looking to convert 5 people for every 100 people that visit your site.

Include a secondary action on the Thank You page

- Follow on social media
- Share something on social media
- Or sell a low-price product

Examples

- Jason Zook (radical honesty)
- Jocelyn K. Glei
- Tobias

Use Zapier to add people to a group “Purchasers”

Do “Acceleration” by”

- Showing new subscribers what they missed.
- Showing new subscribers what your popular content is.
- Giving your new subscribers a mission or a task to complete.

Where do people go wrong with newsletters?

- They assume their list is about them first and their audience second.
- You only email your list when you want something from them (sale, favor, survey, or share).

# *Run a content test to validate your idea*

Talk to your audience one on one.

Ask questions to your audience in your welcome email to get to know them more.

Goal: Create content that somebody else can’t replicate. Only you must have your personality, style, and opinion.

Summary of running a content test

1. Define the audience you want to reach.
2. See if you can target that audience as a group.
3. Create a piece of content for that audience.
4. Share it with them.
5. Analyze the data.

# *The keys to consistent content*

Consistent content is easier than epic content

# *The ins and outs of actually creating content*

Do an AB test to see what is better received: full article or link

# *Building trust through education*

Cialdini, Influence: Science and Practice

---

# *Plan your (tiny) product*

Run a survey around what your product’s outcome would be and what problem your product solves. Send the survey to your email list then see if your assumptions are correct. Also notice their qualitative descriptions of the problem and potential solutions.

What beta testing can help you learn

- how people are onboarded and where they might get stuck
- how people use what you’ve created and act on it
- how people solve problems with what you’ve created

Pick issues and bugs when there is only a few people using your product

---

# *How to make it seem like you and your product are everywhere*

Create blips for other people:

- Write product reviews
- Write testimonials
- Share your success story from something your bought
- Leave reviews of podcasts on itunes

The more you can help get blips for other people, the more you can get blips in return.

If you sold someone something and they like it, ask them for a review, a writeup, or invite them for a success story.

Pitch journalists that you are an expert in a subject.

People need to see you a dozen times in different places before they can trust you enough to make a purchase. They can’t just hear about you in one sales page and a purchase will happen.

It’s easier to make a sale when all the blips are happening. People just skip the sales page and buy.

After making a sale, educate customers on how to use your product using a post-purchase automation. At the end of the automation, ask them if they want to join your affiliate program (or get the word out or just share).

# *Learn the necessary elements of a launch*

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vy_nky0jnsQmNKP-1uU1ZkghLvxxOVMTlPdJHJnU5i0/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vy_nky0jnsQmNKP-1uU1ZkghLvxxOVMTlPdJHJnU5i0/edit)

After people exchange their email address for your free sample, send them emails that:

- Share more content
- Share success stories
- Share reasons your product exists
- Share who it helps
- Answer their questions
- Then pitch

When you have these five elements from a previous product, you can simply edit them to be reused for your new product.

---

# *Build a personality-driven sales page that sells like crazy*

Research how people are talking about your product in surveys, conversations, or beta testing. Then use your audience’s language to write your sales page.

---

# *Run a webinar (yes, you, the persn who doesn't want to do one)*

Webinar

- Workshop
- Live Q&A
- Live vloging your launch
- Online live video of you doing something that other’s can attend with relates to your launch

---

# *Moonwalk your way to a successful launch*

From launch day, walk backwards to thinking about the audience you want to reach and your reason for reaching them specifically.

Pre-sale

- Great way to test your idea and positioning (if people buy it, your idea and positioning are valid)
- Great way to generate money to offset the costs of development.
- Tricky: It requires a lot of trust. You’re getting money and people are getting nothing in return.

Timed

- Good for urgency
- Bad because your revenue goes to zero when the product is not available
- Example: Chimp Essentials needs to be up-to-date to MailChimp’s current look, so needs constant updates and product needs to be timed.

Evergreen

- A product technically sells every day.
- Challenge: You need to create more urgency for people to buy it now instead of later.

Decide the kind of launch that is right for you, your product, and the audience that it serves.

---

# *Should you keep launching (hint: the answer is yes)*

If you have a discount or bonus, it’s a great reason for a relaunch.
