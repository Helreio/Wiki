# 2020-06 Monthly report

## Summary

Quarantine measures relaxed this month, so I got to ride my bike farther. It also meant that my father, mother, and Bernice can now leave Sta. Maria, transfer to Cablong, and leave me mostly alone with the dogs at home. Although this would teach me that I can actually live by myself alone and be okay with it, this would also lead to a lot of emotional challenges, amplified by the fact that Tungko ng Tula ended this month, which would convince me that I needed to transfer somewhere else and start a new life. Despire all these, this month was also the beginning of my translation of Thoreau, setting up my new Macbook Pro, and my project of establishing a minimum viable life system. Also, one of my best achievements this month was getting off of Facebook for more than a week. This was in application of what I learned in The Science of Well-being.

## Good Events

- Rode my bike to San Roque and Casibong after three months
- Rode my bike to town for the first time and saw the market abandoned
- Explored Notion
- Played basketball with Dondon after four months of quarantine
- Graduated in Tungko
- I set up my new Macbook Pro
- Learned the name of the children who live along my favorite trail
- Discovered Tiago Forte and started reading about PARA.
- Started sharing my nature videos on YouTube.
- I started translating Thoreau quotes into Filipino.

## Setback and Challenges

- The rainy season started. The quarantine relaxed a bit and my parents moved out of the house to stay in my mother’s town to recover from the long lockdown. I was left at home mostly alone with the dogs.

## Personal Triumphs

- Been out of Facebook for more than a week and I was okay.
- When Rem needed someone to talk to, I responded favorably.
- Was able to setup my backup system through Acronis.
- Had the courage to post in Patrons in Pursuit and ask Steve.
- Applied Tiago’s system to organize my inbox and started improving my life system.
