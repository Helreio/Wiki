**How To Be A Successful Creative When You Have a Health Condition**

**1. Prioritize your health.**

This means what it means. Put your health in the frontline, it is your priority and it stays there no matter what happens.

Listen to what your body is telling you. If you feel sleepy, sleep. If your eyes are painful because you have stayed in front of the computer for too long, stop, close your laptop, close your eyes, lie down, rest. If you’re vomiting, having headaches, feeling sad and down the dumps for doing something you don’t want to do, stop doing the damn thing!

**2. Make enough money. Just enough.**

The only way you can succeed as a creative is to prioritize doing creative work. The only way you can prioritize doing creative work is creating enough time and space for doing it. The only way you can create enough time and space to do your creative work is to borrow time from work that is suppose to keep you alive - income-generating projects, businesses, client work, or your day job.

If you are serious about doing creative work that matters despite having a health problem, you have to be willing to cut time from your job or other activities in order for you to have enough time to develop your craft and produce work you can later show off. Cutting time off your job is not easy because it entails taking a new perspective on money and your financial life. But you need to be open to shifting your belief about money so you can embrace the creative life.
