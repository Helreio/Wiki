# How to Take Stunning iPhone Landscape Photos

Start with a strong subject.

Hard light during a sunny day is bad for landscape photography.

It’s best if the sky is partially overcast.

A foggy day is also great and mysterious.

Golden hour is good for large open spaces.

In landscape photography, foreground can be even more important than background. Foreground provides context and depth in relation to the background.

Take a photo with both foreground and background.

Use HDR function in landscape photography.

Take a photo of the same place at different times of the year.

Adding a person in your photo could help the viewer see the scale of objects in your landscape.

# Tips for Capturing Beautiful iPhone Portrait Photos

How to find the perfect light

- Avoid hard light because of strong shadows.
- Take a subject to a shade.
- Soft light make people look younger and more beautiful.
- If taking portrait photos indoors, find light coming from a window or doorway. This is natural light.

Focus on an eye. Use the eye closes to the camera.

Set exposure correctly by making sure skin tone is okay.

Select a simple background.

- Portraits are all about the person.
- Background should not distract us from the subject.
- Focus on the subject and their emotions.

Shoot from the eyes of the eyes of a subject.

When shooting children, do not shoot down on them. Shoot from the height of the subject.

Do not cut the joints of a subject (including fingers).

Position eyes on the gridlines, one on an intersection.

Interact with your subject.

- Give positive feedback.
- Help the subject relax.
- Make them have a good time.
- Be mindful of your nonverbal communication.
- Don’t show disappointment when a photo doesn’t work out. It will make a subject conscious about how they look.
- Strike a conversation so they can be candid.

# Techniques for Candid iPhone Street Photoraphy

Goal: Show candid moments without being intrusive.

Your goal in street photography is to isolate a subject.

Pick a time and place where there are few people.

For street photography, hard light might be better.

Build your confidence by:

- Starting with taking photos from the distance initially.
- Take a photo behind the subjects.
- Take a photo in a place where people are taking photos all the time.

Two approaches

1. Find a location with a stream of people passing by (easy).

Use the headphones to pretend you are listening but are taking a photo.

Be discreet in looking at the phone or not look at it at all.

Make your subject standout in the surroundings.

- Use color. If your subject wears dark, use a light background and vice versa.

In hard light, pick a spot and stay there and wait for people to pass by.

Set and lock exposure before taking photos in hard light locations.

Use burst to capture the right photos.

- People walking in full stride.

It’s best to use one subject or two subjects that are not overlapping.

Mystery is created when some part of your subject is illuminated while others are not.

Follow your subject or hangout with them and take photos discreetly.

Don’t expect well. Unlike other kinds of photography, it is difficult to nail down street photography.

Don’t sell photos or use it for billboards.

It is legal to take photos of people in public places in most jurisdictions.

Don’t take photos of children if they are recognizeable.
