# It's good to have listened to Sean and I really think his advice is very very wise.

But it's important to note that this is just one method.

A lot of artists survived their artistic life without following this advice, necessarily word by word.

But it is a good advice.

I sure know what it feels like (because I have experienced it) to fret and worry and not have that emotional state of mind I need to create.

I create best if my sustenance needs are taken cared of. I can still create without this, but the point is, I create BEST when I do so.
