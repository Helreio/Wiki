# Michael Malice

What I like most about Michael Malice is how optimistic he is that anarchy will become the political system of choice by most people eventually. The reason behind his optimism is almost “new agey”. He believes that certain things are going to happen soon that would crumble the status quo and change the world in a way that is more favorable to anarchy. Here, he is different from [[Noam Chomsky]], who despite being an anarchist does not think an anarchic world is possible.

The same enthusiasm is noticeable from [[Steve Patterson]].

One of the things he mentioned will lead to the eventual downfall of the status quo—the downfall of universities. When he spoke about the downfall of the Soviet Union, it makes me think if a country vanished, a system like the university could too.
