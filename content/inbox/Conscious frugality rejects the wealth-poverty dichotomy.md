# Conscious frugality rejects the wealth-poverty dichotomy

Wealth and poverty plays the same game. The wealthy are the winners of the game. The poor are the losers. But the game is always accumulation.

[[thoughts/henry david thoreau]]'s frugality refused to play this game. His game was that "less is more”. Simplicity is fulfilling and more desirable. The lesser we have, the more we discover enjoyment.

> Poverty in this sense is not the opposite of wealth: it is its exact complement. The rich man greedily consumes, eyeing his neighbour’s plate to see if it contains more than his. The poor man for his part seizes the leftovers from the feast. They are playing the same game, it’s just that there are winners and losers. The frugality Thoreau recommends is opposed as much to wealth as it is to poverty: the wealth of those who become alienated in order to have more and more, the poverty of those who toil to earn the square root of nothing. Instead it is against the system, a matter of refusing to play. Not hanging onto your capital, saving parsimoniously, refraining from spending, but staying out of the game altogether: a chosen, conscious frugality.

> austerity always includes the idea of resisting the temptation of excess: too much food, too much wealth, too many possessions, too much pleasure. Austerity pinpoints the slope from pleasure towards excess. So it is a question of holding back, cutting down on quantities, saying no. In austerity there is a good proportion of severity, a contempt or rather a fear of pleasure. Austerity is a refusal to let go, an interdiction on feeling too much for fear of being carried away. Frugality, in contrast, is the discovery that simplicity is fulfilling, the discovery of perfect enjoyment with little or nothing
