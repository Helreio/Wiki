**A Short Introduction on Thoreau (10 mins.)**

- Historical Context
   - What was happening in the Philippines at this time?
   - What was happening in the world at this time?
   - What was happening in the United States at this time?
- Thoreau’s Family
   - Genealogy
      - The very name Thoreau was novel—foreign, French, part of a Revolutionary wave of restlessness that carried European immigrants into New England’s market towns and industrial centers.
      - The Thoreaus—or “Tiereaus,” or perhaps Toraux or Thaureaux—were Huguenots forced to flee Catholic France in 1685.
   - Father
   - Mother
   - Siblings
   - Other relatives
   - Where they lived
      - His family kept transferring from one house to another.
      - Where did they finally settle down?
   - Thoreau’s birth
      - Born: July 12, 1817
      - 1816, “Year without a Summer”
      - 1815, Indonesia’s Mount Tambora erupted, the largest volcanic event in over 1,300 years
      - on July 12, 1817, Cynthia gave birth to a healthy baby boy. They called him Henry, but then, only six weeks later, John’s little brother David died, just after coming of age at twenty-one. So on October 12, when it came time to bring their infant son to the First Parish Church for baptism, they followed family custom and kept the name alive: the Reverend Ezra Ripley baptized their second son David Henry Thoreau.
   - Thoreau’s childhood
      - It was a barefoot, knockabout childhood—rough, unfussy, and close to the soil, with animals everywhere.
      - Even as a child, his spirit longed for “that sweet solitude,”
      - His mother told a friend how, when Henry and John still slept together in a trundle bed, “John would go to sleep at once, but Henry often lay long awake. His mother found the little boy lying so one night, long after he had gone upstairs, and said, ‘Why, Henry dear, why don’t you go to sleep?’ ‘Mother’ said he, ‘I have been looking through the stars to see if I couldn’t see God behind them.’”
- Concord
   - Concord launched America’s Manifest Destiny; it was, quite literally, America’s first West.
   - In the face of all this, Tahatawan’s people proved remarkably resilient. In 1644, only seven years after their bargain with the English, they petitioned to become Christian subjects of the English crown

   - Thoreau thus saw the end of one geological epoch and the beginning of the next

**The Lessons (30 mins.)**

Lesson 1: Take care of your finances

- Look at your work as a harvest.
- “In short, you’ve got to carry on two farms at once,—the farm on the earth and the farm in your mind.”
- You have two farms
   1. Mind
   2. Finances
- How did Thoreau take care of his first farm?
   1. He kept his life simple.
   2. He had multiple streams of income.
- How did he keep his life simple?
   - He had a few expenses.
      - Travel
      - Rent at his family’s boardinghouse
      - Debts to publishers
   - Thoreau bought his freedom by keeping his needs simple and his account books balanced to the half cent.
   - In his deepening sense of worldly poverty, too ill even to write, Thoreau renewed his commitment to getting his living “in a simple, primitive fashion,” elevating his life as much as possible
- How did Thoreau establish multiple streams of income?
   - He became a day laborer, doing various jobs.
      - For a dollar a day, good pay for a day laborer, he built fences, painted houses, did carpentry, bricked up at least one chimney, and performed a host of other odd jobs
   - He got involved in the family’s pencil business.
   - He opened a school with his brother John.
   - He became a civil engineer and land surveyor.
      - Over the next eleven years, Thoreau would complete more than 150 additional surveying jobs, each requiring days or weeks of hard work
      - surveying also gave Thoreau a respected professional identity
      - When lecturing and writing both failed, surveying must pay
   - He earned from his lectures.
      - As for lecturing, so far he’d given all his lectures for free. That changed in October 1848
   - He earned from his articles.
   - He earned from his books.
   - He took advantage of the gift economy.
      - Emerson provided him with the land he need to build a house at Walden pond where he lived for two years.
      - He also lived in Emerson’s house for a while exchanging his expertise with board, lodging, and access to Emerson’s library.
   - Lecturing paid little—most out-of-town lectures earned twenty dollars or so, less travel expenses—and so did manual labor; once he even considered speculating in cranberries.24 Far more reliable was the income he earned from surveying. In 1850, Thoreau became a fully professional civil engineer
- There were times when the two farms converge
   - Lectures
   - Articles
   - Books
   - Surveying
      - Only once before had those “two farms” folded together into a single survey—back in January 1846, when Thoreau had sounded the depths of Walden Pond. In the summer of 1859 he would again make those two farms one, when his friends in the Concord Farmers’ Club approached him with the biggest commission he would ever undertake: a survey of the Concord River from East Sudbury all the way to the dam at Billerica Mills, over twenty-two miles in all. At stake was the future of Concord itself.
- However, when the two farms did not converge, Thoreau knew what he had to do to protect what matters most, his primary farm.

Lesson 2: Build a second brain.

- Maintaining a family or a state was easy compared with maintaining the children of your brain, yet that was the only way to keep up the power of original thought.
- mindful cultivation of one’s inner being and one’s greater community, a spiritual rather than material growth through education, art, music, and philosophy.
- Read and collect resonant information.
- Thoreau filled dozens of notebooks with extracts from hundreds of volumes, creating his own working library
   - In Harvard
      - in a mere four hours “a young man of any capacity at all” could easily accomplish the day’s tasks, leaving him lots of time to pursue his own bent “unimpeded.”23 For Thoreau this meant walking off into the countryside to observe birds or hunt for nests and eggs.
      - It also meant daily trips to Harvard’s tremendous library, the best in the nation.
      - There in the stacks Thoreau began his lifelong habit of keeping a permanent record of his reading by copying extracts into commonplace books.
- Gather resources
- Have a place where these are placed
   - For Thoreau, it was his journal and his room.
   - What Thoreau couldn’t carry away in his notebook, he often carried away in his pockets. Thus it was that the Yellow House attic became a kind of material memory, the place that held and preserved his expanding mental universe: notebooks, journal volumes, books, maps, charts, tables, natural history specimens, and curiosities.
- Kalendar
   - But in this hidden molten core Thoreau was fusing and transforming his accumulated years of scientific study into a new kind of instrument, a musical instrument, where every object was a key that, struck, resonated across hidden chambers of memory and meaning. He called it his “Kalendar,” but it was far more: a symphonic rotation capable of fusing and igniting a lifetime’s immersion in a single, beloved, deeply known New England village. In his youth Thoreau had imagined writing “a poem to be called Concord”; now, on his worn green writing desk, that great poem was taking shape.

Lesson 3: Ground yourself in place.

- No American writer is more place centered than Thoreau.
- Thoreau used the specifics of place to embody deeper and more universal truths.
- Concord
   - Thank goodness, he told himself, poverty had nailed him to “this my native region so long and steadily—and made to study & love this spot of earth more & more.”
- House
   - **The “Upper Empire"**
      - the budding writer hungered for solitude. Henry took a room in the attic—what he called his “upper empire,” from whose “perspective window” he could look out on the sunrise and see “all things . . . in their true relations.”
      - There in that upper empire he wrote up his first lecture for the Concord Lyceum, on April 11, 1838, on “Society.”
      - his contented homelife provided the stability Thoreau needed to pursue his career the way that he did.
      - Without such a stable and contented homelife, Thoreau could not possibly have pursued his career in the way that he did. His attic chamber in the Yellow House became Walden-on-Main, a room of his own in an equitable and interdependent household in which everyone helped out.

Lesson 4: Nurture your community.

- Surround yourself with people like you no matter how few they are. Make the most of your relationship.
- For Thoreau, society was part of Nature. The two are intertwined.
- It isn’t true that he was a hermit. His Walden years are still highly social.
   - Walden Pond was hardly wilderness; it was a familiar part of Concord’s daily life, as it had been for two hundred years. Moving there hardly removed Thoreau from the circles of family, friends, and village life, and he made a point of maintaining his friendships as before.
   - Thoreau declared he kept three chairs: “one for solitude, two for friendship, three for society.”
- What were the most important relationships that Thoreau had?
   - Family
   - Mentor
   - Inner circle
   - Professional relationships
      - Agent
         - Get up some short passages from the book manuscript and get them printed around. “You must write to the magazines in order to let the public know who and what you are. . . . You may write with an angel’s pen, yet your writings have no mercantile, money value till you are known and talked of as an author.” (Look up who said this)
      - **Greeley**
   - Outer circle
   - Readers and followers
- How did Thoreau take advantage of his relationships?
   - Family
   - Mentor
      - Brownson (which will be discussed later)
      - Emerson
         - His lifelong dialogue with Emerson, by turns loving, inspired, hostile, angry, and reconciled, would turn Thoreau into a great and wholly original writer. Thoreau’s creativity was realized not alone but in partnership, as Emerson fanned his creativity into genius.
         - Emerson had a convert in Henry Thoreau, who joined his household on April 26, “to live with me & work with me in the garden & teach me to graft apples.”87 The arrangement would last over two years: Thoreau became Emerson’s live-in gardener and handyman, and tutor and caretaker to the Emerson children.
         - In exchange, Thoreau had free run of Emerson’s library, free rein to entertain Emerson’s endless stream of visitors, and free time to study, write, and roam as he pleased. Thoreau’s mood lifted immediately.
         - Under Emerson’s roof, Thoreau consolidated his sense of himself as above all a writer—not a dilettante who published occasionally, but a true and focused professional patterned after Emerson’s own model, which Thoreau now witnessed daily.
   - Inner circle
      - Transcendentalists
         - on May 13, 1840, he attended his first meeting of the Transcendental Club, at Emerson’s house.
         - Channing
         - Margaret Fuller
         - Ricketson
   - Professional relationships
      - Publisher
      - Agent
   - Outer circle
      - Clubs
   - Readers and followers
      - Harrison Gray Otis Blake
         - Blake gave Thoreau what he most needed: the conviction that he had something to say and an audience to whom he could say it.

Lesson 5: Create a creative process.

- The “white spaces” he wished to explore were not on the map, but in the mind. These two forms of exploration, outer and inner, converged in surprising ways
- For Thoreau
   1. Walks
      - Thoreau had always walked; it was how a man without means got from here to there. But in the previous year, he realized, “my walks have extended themselves,” and after his morning work, almost every afternoon, he visited “some new hill or pond or wood many miles distant.” In another year, these long walks would no longer be a diversion from work; they would be the work itself, his major literary project.
      - Thoreau’s walks became a form of meditation, a spiritual as well as physical discipline.
      - Over the years it grew into the single greatest statement of his philosophy of life, for walking—away from the village, away from politics, into the “Wild” for spiritual regeneration—was not, Thoreau asserted, a form of retreat, but “a sort of crusade . . . to go forth and reconquer this holy land from the hands of the Infidels.” Higher law was not a court of appeal in which sins might be tried; it was a land where freedom was not a state of exception, where freedom was a home in which one could dwell.
   2. Field Notes
      - Thoreau at work, perpetually in motion, covering miles before others had poured their second cup of morning coffee—seeking, looking, asking, carrying. He was courteous, generous, alert, purposeful, occasionally curt. He spent much of every day out on his “springy & unwearable” legs, as Channing called them, interrogating farmers, children, laborers, woodchoppers, shopkeepers, Indians, railroad workers, hunters, fishermen—in short, everyone
      - He roamed and rested, studied and took notes, working intensely, filling his field notebook, laying a foundation for future work. It was his usual method: dense, elliptical jottings in the field for expansion in his Journal, revision into lectures, essays, books. This was meant to be the start of a new chapter on the West.
   3. Journal
      - solitude and journal-keeping work together: solitude is not for empty reverie but for the productive habit of exploring, pen in hand
      - Thoreau’s response to that call inaugurated a monumental life’s work, an epic journey of over two million words, sustained as long as he could hold a pen.
      - Thoreau’s first journal entry.
      - How Thoreau’s journal changed.
      - His daily journal has become his masterpiece. Even more important than his books.
      - each inspiration duly entered in his Journal to be “winnowed” into lectures and then into essays
      - his Journal began to fill with the homespun observations of landowners, farmers, and laborers. Thanks to his voracious curiosity, what might have narrowed his field of view and blinded his vision had the opposite effect: a surveyor’s eyes were open eyes, and as his surveying journal filled with professional notes, his private journal filled with scientific and poetic observations of all he could see with what he called “the side of his eye.” If his profession forced him to step aside from his chosen path, it also helped him to see the world around him anew: “I wanted to know the name of every shrub,” he declared, even as he hacked through the underbrush.
   4. Lectures
      - the new Concord Lyceum, which became one of the organizing centers of Thoreau’s life
      - He lectured there himself nearly twenty times in as many years, testing out his ideas before a live audience
      - Thoreau decided to refine his trio of Walden lectures, take Walden on the road, make a little money, drum up some publicity, and try out his new material before fresh audiences. At this rate, soon he’d have to his name not one book, but two.
      - And the method Thoreau established of developing his writings by watching his words miss or hit home with a living audience stayed with him; behind his pages are the faces of thousands of men and women, often opinionated and always unpredictable, who laughed, argued, and, sometimes, rolled their eyes.
   5. Essays
      - Under the surface of Thoreau’s placid homelife was a mind on fire. The quieter his days, the more extravagant his pages. The key to creativity, he thought, was to keep writing and not judge or edit too soon: “You must try a thousand themes before you find the right one—as nature makes a thousand acorns to get one oak.”
   6. Books
- Create an ecology of your work.
   - at Emerson’s, he was living it still, surrounded by manuscripts in various stages of composition, a different project for every mood and interest, each one finding its unique voice and stance relative to the others and all of them together composing a literary ecology.
- Thoreau also modified his process
   - on November 8, 1850, he wrote up everything he noticed and thought during his daily walk as one long entry.
   - Thoreau’s new experiment made the very act of writing visible on the page
   - And this is what truly staggers the mind: from this point, Thoreau did not stop doing this, ever—not until, dying and almost too weak to hold a pen, he crafted one final entry.
   - filling pages with a stream-of-consciousness flow of words as if he were writing while walking: “I pluck,” “I heard,” “I saw yesterday,” “I notice.”
   - The date, and what he can write of his life on that one day, is no longer incidental to some larger quest—it is the quest. Virtually every day from then through the end of his life, with few exceptions, Thoreau wrote a dated entry that explored whatever caught his mind that day.
   - without announcing it, Thoreau simply stopped using his Journal as the means to the “real” work of art somewhere else, and started treating the Journal itself as the work of art, with all the integrity that art demands.
   - this new mode, his Journal volumes were something like scientific notebooks, laboratory records whose value lay precisely in their regularity and completeness.
   - Reorienting his writing required reorienting the pattern of his daily life. Thoreau’s new protocol required a high degree of focus and discipline, for its value depended on consistency: going out every day, and every day pressing language to find something new to see
   - Thoreau developed the practice of walking with pencil and paper and scribbling notes on the spot, brief names and phrases that he wrote up the following morning in long, often lyrical Journal entries—sometimes, when he got backed up, writing out two or three days’ worth at a time—then setting out that afternoon for another three- or four-hour walk.
   - Sometimes he varied it, walking abroad in the morning and writing in the afternoon; sometimes he unsettled his senses by walking before dawn or staying out well past midnight. But he must go out
   - This was the pattern of his travel now: focused and intense field trips, taken with purpose in mind and notebook in hand, with guidebooks at his fingertips together with his map of Massachusetts
   - plus his plant press and measuring tape, all tucked away in his custom-made waterproof backpack with pockets designed for easy storage.85 Home or abroad, from now on, his philosophy was the same: “Why not begin his travels at home—

Lesson 6: Develop openness and find the interconnections of everything.

- Combine what doesnt seem to be matched together.
- Thoreau combined poetry, science, literature, and blue-collar work
- The more closely Thoreau lived and worked in nature, the more he was drawn to science
   - Science allowed Thoreau to create his own twist of transcendentalism
      - What is transcendentalism?
         - Over the years, the Transcendentalists would argue with one another and follow many paths, but all held firm to the belief that a divine principle dwells within every person.
      - How did Thoreau modify transcendentalism?
         - Thoreau longed to understand the workings of things, and, like Emerson, he believed this was poet’s work: “The poet uses the results of science and philosophy, and generalizes their widest deductions.” But unlike Emerson, Thoreau calibrated those insights with the instruments of science and engineering.
         - Thoreau needed this breakthrough insight for his own kind of Transcendentalism. Science showed him how to see the Cosmos in a grain of sand or the ocean in a woodland pond, a mountain range in Fairhaven Cliff, a glacier in the cobblestones of Walden Pond. Poetry gave him a voice to show the world why this mattered.
   - he was the scientist among poets, and the poet among scientists—the one person in America who could make poetry and science not two things but one.
- p. 369
- Languages
   - Thoreau went on to make languages his special project.
   - By the time he graduated, Thoreau could read at least five foreign languages—Latin, Greek, Italian, French, and German—plus a little Spanish and Portuguese.
   - On his own he studied Wampanoag, the Native American language of eastern Massachusetts
- Religion
   - Thoreau became an exacting student of the Bible, and he went beyond it to read the scriptures of other major religions, including Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism, seeking for the true fountainhead of spiritual truth.
- Social Activism
   - his social activism and his defense of nature sprang from the same roots: he found society in nature, and nature he found everywhere, including the town center and the human heart.
- Thoreau embodied the well-rounded man described by Emerson in his essay “Self-reliance"
   - “A sturdy lad . . . who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not ‘studying a profession,’ for he does not postpone his life, but lives already.” (from Emerson’s Self-Reliance)
- When Channing asked him why he was so endlessly curious about everything, Thoreau answered, “What else is there in life?”
- “I am a mystic—a transcendentalist—& a natural philosopher to boot,”

Lesson 7: Free your mind.

- “Any can command him who doth not command himself.”
- Thoreau suffered intellectual bondage in Harvard.
   - Every term for three long years, Edward Tyrrel Channing, the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory, issued Thoreau a long series of assignments, every one of which he collected, corrected, and returned, scored on Quincy’s merciless eight-point scale. If Thoreau kept a journal through these years, it is lost; if he wrote letters home, they are gone; when he ventured into poetry, his verses mostly vanished.42 What survives are his essays for Channing. They disappoint.
   - Harvard “nearly ruined him as a writer.”
   - The young and earnest Henry Thoreau learned so well how to write for his teacher that it took ten years and a move to Walden Pond to shake himself free.
   - Feeling rootless and cut off from the person he had been, Thoreau was confessing anxiety over his new identity as a Harvard graduate and a young man of promise. It was around this time that he changed his name, reversing the baptismal “David Henry” to his preferred “Henry David.”
- How he overcame Harvard’s spell?
   - This was Thoreau’s first encounter with a free-range intellectual for whom ideas snapped and crackled, who moved easily in the circles of the great and the near great. His term with Brownson broke the spell of Harvard.
   - Thoreau was living with Brownson at the very moment he was writing his breakthrough book, New Views of Society, Christianity, and the Church, which soon joined Emerson’s Nature as a founding text of Transcendentalism.
   - Thoreau was testing out Transcendentalism on his own well before it existed as a movement.
- Hence emancipation must begin with self-examination: “What a man thinks of himself, that it is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate.”

Lesson 8: Dare greatly and be okay with the results.

- Thoreau’s exploration with poetry
   - The poet Emerson had hailed as America’s purest and loftiest had published, at the end of two years, exactly four poems.
   - But Fuller’s real point, that his talent was far greater than his execution, was not lost on Thoreau. He was a genius, no doubt, but he had yet to learn his craft. This was precisely the lesson Thoreau needed to hear, and it was Fuller who gave it to him.
- Publishing A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers
   - Boxed in, unable to afford publishing costs, Thoreau concluded that his book would not be published until it was simply too good to turn down. So he took it off the market and set himself to making it even better. In the meantime, to raise money he polished up “Ktaadn” and sent it off to Greeley—hence his fervent gratitude when, in mere months, Greeley had not only placed “Ktaadn” but paid handsomely and begged for more.
   - But what Greeley begged for was more short pieces. What Thoreau had was a book. “My book is swelling again under my hands,” he replied, “but as soon as I have leisure I shall see to those shorter articles. So look out.”59 Nothing Greeley said could dissuade him from making A Week his highest priority. Thoreau was certain only a big, new book would get him out from under Emerson’s shadow; and besides, before anything else must come his memorial to John.
   - The problem was Munroe. He didn’t publish books; he only printed them. He refused to advertise, and he had no distribution network. One could purchase Thoreau’s book only by visiting Munroe’s shop in Boston or by ordering it from Munroe by mail. This business model had worked for Emerson, who was already well known and whose fame was centered in Boston. But for a first book by an unknown author seeking a national audience, it was a disaster.
   - His book sold barely over two hundred copies. The man who took pride in building a house for $28.12½ owed his publisher $290—a year’s ordinary wages. It would take him four years to pay it off, dollar by hard-earned dollar.
   - By fall 1849, it was painfully clear to Thoreau that the book he wrote to prove himself to Emerson had failed to please him. Worse, by following Emerson’s advice to print it no matter the risk, Thoreau precipitated himself into ruinous financial debt.
- Being jailed
- Standing up against slavery
- Living in Walden
   - forced Thoreau, an intensely solitary introvert, to devise a public persona that could stand up to all the scrutiny and defend his private self from the glare of publicity.
- Walking
   - All year he’d been walking daily—often nightly, too, exploring the woods and fields by moonlight despite many raised eyebrows.
- Doing his work despite criticism and naysayers from neighbors
- Suffering censorship
   - Thoreau often found his voice silenced and censored
   - endless charges of hypocrisy
   - from the very beginning, such charges have been used to silence Thoreau.
   - Thoreau struggled all his life to find a voice that could be heard despite the din of cynicism and the babble of convention.
   - No other publisher would touch the aborted series. “Excursion to Canada” was a flop. Nor would this be the last time an adversarial Thoreau crossed pens with an editor too afraid of public outrage to print his words unexpurgated: “Cape Cod” and “Chesuncook” would meet the same fate, with similar results. The more Thoreau knew his own mind and spoke it aloud, the more the era’s outraged guardians of public morality sought to cut off his tongue.
   - The problem was how to be heard when nearly everything he wrote had been rejected, ignored, or censored.
- Facing criticism
   - Lowell and pegged Thoreau as an Emerson imitator.

Lesson 9: Do what feels good.

- Feedback from his stay in New York
   - he moved to New York City and tried to be like other writers, mobile and market driven. It was a disaster.
   - So it appeared. A failure this complete slammed the door on a literary career—or at least, on the kind of literary career Thoreau had been pursuing since 1837, when he had been Emerson’s bright new genius. Now he was back in Concord, worn down and tarnished, but home. His months in New York drained the city of both its romance and its power to intimidate. From its mean crowded streets, shabby offices, and hollow parlors, Thoreau had finally seen what he’d said before but not quite believed: Concord truly was his Rome, its citizens his Romans. “Defeat is heaven’s success,” he told himself once. Abroad he’d met only defeat. Now it was time to see if success resided at home.
- Being single
   - The flowering of passion in “beauty & art” was his true calling, which he guarded fiercely with what he called (in the language of his day) “chastity.”
   - In another place and time, he might have found his life’s partner with a man. For Thoreau, however, in Victorian Concord, that door was closed. In his acute, unspeakable awareness of difference from those around him, he crafted a self of fluid but carefully guarded sensuality and intense, thwarted romantic energies, and he poured those energies, with ever-increasing passion, into his devotional life as an artist and prophet
- Deciding no longer to go to lecture tours
   - But Thoreau couldn’t get rid of the bad taste in his mouth. He had cheapened himself, exhausted himself trying to become a popular lecturer, and for what? Twice now, audiences in major cities had yawned at his best new material. The whole enterprise was a failure. Worse, it took away what he treasured above all else, his freedom to walk daily into nature, to see what each new day brought forth. “Winter has come unnoticed by me,” he sulked again, on his return from Providence. Better to write books. Let his audience be sifted that way; better they come to him than he go to them.27 And with that resolution, his plans for a big Western lecture tour evaporated. Such grand tours worked for Emerson, who made them annually, but this was the last time Thoreau sought a lecture engagement outside New England
- Thoreau discerned that there is a distinction between the work he did for himself and the work he did for others (see biography p. 368, 435

Lesson 10: Your life is your art. Your masterpiece. Infuse it in your work.

- turn life itself, even the simplest acts of life, into a form of art.
- How did Thoreau treat his life as his art?
   1. His move to Walden was a performance art
      - Moving to Walden Pond thus had a double purpose: it offered a writer’s retreat, where Thoreau could follow his calling as spiritual seeker, philosopher, and poet; and it offered a public stage on which he could dramatize his one-person revolution in consciousness, making his protest a form of performance art.
      - But now, instead of claiming a little space in a communal house, an alcove or attic, he would claim an entire life, and declare that writing would be not an occasional hobby but the central hub of his whole being. From now on, Thoreau would be a writer in an entirely new sense: instead of living a little, then writing about it, his life would be one single, integrated act of composition.
      - His original determination to live deliberately and confront only the essential facts of life, voiced so movingly in his earliest days at the pond, show his design to pursue an inward journey, but the accidental circumstances that made that journey possible meant it would be performed on a very public stage. His two years, two months, and two days living at Walden Pond became and would forever remain an iconic work of performance art. The surprise is how quickly and effectively Thoreau understood what was happening and pivoted his vision and goals to take advantage of it
- he emphasized living “deliberately”; that is, living so as to perceive and weigh the moral consequence of our choices.
- his every act was a sermon, and his every encounter—even a casual meeting on the road—was a challenge to explain, to justify, to proselytize.
- Oriental wisdom, especially the Bhagavad Gita influenced him on this
   - The Gita became the closest thing Thoreau had to a personal Bible.
   - To truly renew this ancient spiritual wisdom, he must first find a way to live it—he must attempt to be a Brahman, to be awakened, Buddha. He must attempt a devotion so complete that he would be a teacher not merely in his writings, but in his life.
- the choices we make create our environment, both political and natural—all the choices, even the least and most seemingly trivial.
- he made of his life itself an extended form of composition, a kind of open, living book.
- Thoreau was writing not in words, but in deeds.
- a pioneer—not a Western one, but an inward one, “the enterprising and independent thinker, applying his discoveries to his own life.”
- Thoreau’s writings are all autobiographical
- encouraged every one of us to enter into the great experiment of life.
- life as a quest toward higher truth.
- He wanted to be Phillips, to stand alone before the million with just such dignity, courage, and integrity—to be, in words he would soon write, “a majority of one.”
- his larger project, “to do right.”
- Your system is your masterpiece.
- the question remained: how to live this truth, there on Main Street in full view of everyone, as well as how to write it—and in living it and writing it, to show it forth to others.

Have a larger vision

- His grand and unifying vision pointed to that deeper, wider reality he’d called “the frame-work of the universe.” When one surveys the dozens of research notebooks, scores of meticulous Journal volumes, the maps and surveys and thousands of pages of natural history notes and unpublished manuscripts, one begins to comprehend the scope of his vision; but to see the full picture, one must also examine the hundreds of books he annotated and the hundreds of charts and graphs where he pooled and organized his growing data. It was a staggeringly ambitious vision—impossible, really—but Thoreau embarked on it with ferocious energy. Nearly all of this activity dates from 1850. Out of this vast front, particular nodes crystallized into a series of books and projects: “Cape Cod” and “The Maine Woods,” taken together, explore the two ultimate poles of wilderness, ocean and mountain and the rivers that connect them. A third node took shape in the Indian Books, Thoreau’s attempt to document indigenous alternatives to European narratives of social and economic life. Connecting them all was natural history, the basic environmental framework on which he could weave his portraits of social and historical change—rather as the Concord and Merrimack Rivers had given, in A Week, a unifying natural baseline, the thread for his golden ingots of study and reflection. Had Thoreau lived long enough to make that western journey through “the wilds of Canada,” it would be easier to see how his brief excursion to Canada fit—even precipitated—his larger vision.

The Artist as Self vs the Artist as a Public Figure

- While his outer self was professional—dry and workmanlike—in private he was incandescent, phosphorescing in the dark like a stick of Maine foxfire.
- But in the wildness of winter solitude, he met “some grand, serene, immortal, infinitely encouraging, though invisible, companion, and walked with him”—steadying his nerves, recovering his senses.

This was Thoreau’s new motto, and his new method, too: “Let us.”

He’d been taught to lecture from on high. Now he was guide and companion, extending a hand, inviting us to come along and share his joy.

From then on, there were two Thoreaus: one quiet, introspective, self-questioning, intensely private, occasionally depressed, and often in poor health; the other brash, boastful, self-certain, loud, and healthy as the rooster crowing to bring in the dawn.

Modulating between these two self-extremes would open up, in the years to come, the full resources of Thoreau’s artistry.

Thoreau stood by his actions, but his emotions were raw and his mind was in turmoil. Before he could speak, he had to measure his thoughts, carefully and deliberately. What was bedrock here, what was “reality”? He would simmer for eighteen months before facing his fellow citizens from the podium with an epochal defense of resistance against civil government.

Thoreau saw his opening here between Carlyle the literary hero and Emerson the idealist philosopher: neither one spoke to “the Man of the Age,” to the life of the ordinary “working-man.” That would be Thoreau’s place—Thoreau the day laborer who could plow a field, swing a hammer, stone a cellar, reset a privy or plant an orchard.

This became another figure for Thoreau’s own artistry: if he arranged his materials just so, nature would speak through him in a voice that carried to town, where even people in the streets would stop to listen, to hear something higher, beyond themselves.

What the world explorers of his day were doing writ large, he could do in microcosm, traveling and writing about the earth as a planet whose smallest and most local features illuminated, and were illuminated by, the Cosmos itself. To the leading edge of science, Thoreau could add his own “home-cosmography.”

Thoreau was now living his life on two tracks, one visible and one hidden. The visible Thoreau was the busy town surveyor, village naturalist, active lecturer, and publishing writer who helped out with the family business. “The independent of independents,” Alcott proclaimed him, “indeed, the sole signer of the Declaration, and a Revolution in himself.”

Yet these quiet years were the most creative of his life. For 1852 and 1853, his Journal alone fills 1,253 rich and provocative pages. He also wrote something over five hundred pages of notes in his Indian Books and two new drafts of Walden, which doubled in size. These pages show his inner life was as extravagant and inventive as his outer life was steady and disciplined.
