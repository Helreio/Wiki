# 5 - Discovering your personal learning profile

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056740,120.453584)

Each person has a distinct, individual way of dealing with information and concepts.

Where people differ

- Amount of structure
- Amount of autonomy
- Amount of instruction
- Reaction to competition
- Preferred locations
- Preferred physical conditions (light, background noise, mobility permitted)

What you can do

- You can make your learning more productive by capitalizing on your personal learning style.
- You can make your learning easier and more fun by discovering how you like to learn, and then adjusting things so that you learn that way.

**TEST 1: YOUR PEAK AND VALLEY LEARNING TIMES**

**3 benefits to knowing your peak and valley times**

1. You will enjoy your learning more when you feel in the mood for it.
2. You will learn faster and more naturally, because you will not be fighting resistance, fatigue, and discomfort.
3. You will make better use of your “low” times by doing thins other than trying to learn.

**Your Best and Worst of Times**

I dislike getting up in the morning. NO

I disklike going to sleep at night. NO

I wish I could sleep all morning. NO

I stay awake for a long time after I get into bed. YES

I feel wide awake only after 10:00 in the morning. NO

If I stay up late at night, I get too sleepy to remember anything. NO

I usually feel a low after lunch. YES

When I have a task requiring concentration, I like to get up early in the morning to do it. NO

I’d rather do those tasks requiring concentration in the afternoon.YES

I’d usually start the tasks that require the most concentration after dinner. NO

I could stay up all night. NO

I wish I didn’t have to go to work before noon. NO

I wish I could stay home during the day and go to work at night. NO

I like going to work in the morning. YES

I can remember things best when I concentrate on them:

- in the morning. YES

I work best during:

- Morning: 9 AM to 12 NN
- Afternoon: 3 PM to 5 PM
- Evening: 8 PM to 9 PM

What to do

1. Arrange your schedule to be free and undisturbed during your peaks.
2. Shut down before you run out of gas. Know when your mind is least likely to be ready for action, and plan ahead to do other useful or enjoyable activities at those times (socializing, routine work, relaxing)
3. Get up an hour or so earlier than usual and start the day with some fast, pleasant learning.

**TEST 2: DO YOU LEARN BOTTOM UP OR TOP DOWN**

Bottom up

- Laying a solid foundation first

Top down

- Gaining an overall perspective before filling in the details

**Are You a Grouper or a Stringer?**

- When studying one unfamiliar subject, I prefer to gather information from diverse topic areas.
- I would rather know a little about a great many subjects.
- When studying from a textbook, I skip ahead and read chapters of special interest out of sequence.
- When asking people for information about some subject of interest, I tend to ask broad questions that call for rather general answers.
- When browsing in a library or bookstore, I stay more or less in one place, looking at books on just a couple of subjects.
- I am best at remembering general principles.
- When performing some tasks, I like to have background information not strictly related to the work.
- You think that educators should give students exposure to a wide range of subjects in college.
- When on vacation, I would rather stay in one place the whole time and get to know it well.
- When learning something, I would rather follow general guidelines.

Grouper - 7

Stinger - 7

I’m a balance between a Grouper and a Singer

**Groupers**

Nature of Groupers

- Prefers to take a broad view of any subject under study.
- Searches out general principles rather than meticulous details.
- Relates one topic to as many other areas of knowledge as possible.
- Quick to find relationships.
- Quick to draw parallels among different areas of study.

Best learning approach for Groupers

- Learns most easily and effectively in unstructured situations.
- Does less well if knowledge is presented according to a rigid plan.
- You are able to bring together a wide range of information.
- You are more successful when an eclectic approach is used.
- You prefer to come to grips with overall principles before getting down to the finer details of a topic.

How Groupers should study

- Jump right into the subject you want to study.
- Go to the library and skim through several books and magazines that look interesting.
- Explore several aspects or topics simultaneously.
- Don't worry about not being systematic, of not mastering the fundamentals first in order to have a solid foundation.
- Look for big ideas, basic concepts, and organizing principles.
- Keep a separate list of the detailed parts of the subject that you will want to master later. You will return to these later so you can have enough practical techniques.

**Stringers**

Nature of Stringers

- Needs a systematic and methodical approach.
- You thrive on a feeling of mastery of each segment and on the cumulative sense of building solidly on the subject as a whole.

Best learning approach for Stringers

- You learn most successfully by mastering specific details before moving to more general concepts.
- Establish a series of clearly defined goals that allow knowledge to be accumulated gradually.
- Only consider facts directly related to the topic under study.
- Less relevant information should be temporarily ignored.

How Stringers should study

- Devote enough time to develop a firmly structured plan with which you feel comfortable.
- Consult the tables of contents of several good books in your field of study and use them to define the scope and priorities in that field.
- Select those topics you want to master and arrange them in a sensible order.
- Learn about each subtopic fully before proceeding to the next.

**4 things to do if your learning situation prevents you from using your preferred style**

1. Check out whether an alternative arrangement can be made for learning what you want to learn.
2. Look for a better provider.
3. Wrap you preferred style around the less congenial tasks.
4. Use some of the other Peak Learning techniques to overcome your resistance (make the subject exciting, practice with friends).

**TEST 3: WHERE ARE YOU LOCATED IN THE FOUR LEARNING QUADRANTS?**

Learn to trust your non-verbal right brain, to follow your hunches, and to follow them up with careful, highly focused left-brain verification.

**Style A**

- Essence of subject is hard core solid data
- Logical and rational approach to get facts straight
- Verifiable facts on which everyone can agree
- Come up with more precise and efficient theories
- Reduces complex issues to simple decisions
- Generates new ways of doing things more efficiently
- Distrusts ambiguity, intuition, and emotion

**Style B**

- Thrives on order, procedure, and stability
- Relies on experts who laid out what to learn in a sequence
- Tackles details in the right order
- Well-planned precise curriculum
- Reliance on what has already worked
- Gets all the details right
- Answers and actions over questions and theories
- Verbal than emotional or intuitive
- Does things on time or on schedule

**Style C**

- Learning = communication with people
- Reading a book = in touch with a person (author)
- Talk with others interested in the subject
- Learn how they feel
- Understand better what the subject means to them
- Sensitive to moods, atmospheres, and attitudes
- Things are body processes rather than visual or verbal information
- Strong interest on people and communication
- Feeling and experience over logic and theory

**Style D**

- Underlying spirit of any subject = what’s important to me
- Grasping it and feeling it with your whole being makes learning meaningful
- Open to turning the information upside down and look at it in a brand new way instead of being spoon-fed specific techniques
- Originality, ambiguity, and surprise
- Preference on metaphor and the ability to picture things over verbalizing
- Thrives on confusion and chaos
- Enjoys the challenge of many possibilities
- Resists coming to final conclusions

**Conclusions**

- On subjects that don’t interest me: I need to rely on relevance and relationships to make it more enjoyable. A laid out process by an expert looks also helpful because I don’t want to make the hard work on a subject I don’t really enjoy. The connection with the expert also lessens the burden of learning the subject. I care less about getting the subject right.
- On subjects that I am beginning to be so passionate about: I again rely heavily on relevance and personal satisfaction. Being connected with people through the subject is also very important to me. When working on something I am passionate about, I want to be free, I want to experiment, and put my personal touch on the learning/creating process. Therefore, relying on a sequence by an expert is less important to me. I care more about getting the “best” knowledge - right facts - that are relevant to me.
- There are also subjects that are very personal that I don’t need relationships to enjoy. Subjects I enjoyed in school are some of them. I only feel relationships are relevant when the thing I am learning are rooted to my personal mission, or a cause I believe in and is directing me to create real life campaigns or projects.

**How to use the learning styles**

- It is hard to find someone who uses only one of the four all the time.
- Your learning style is a blend of what you marked as 1 and 2.
- If the numbers you assigned vary among different styles, you have more flexible approach to learning.
- Pick the one that’s appropriate to a given learning situation.
- Adjust the conditions of your learning based on your styles.
- Seek learning situations in which your approach works best.
- Choose a less comfortable style to stretch your learning muscles.

**TEST 4: WHAT ARE YOUR PERSONAL INTELLIGENCES?**

**Intelligence**

- A learning talent that seems to come easily.
- Arises from a combination of talent and environmental factors.

**7 intelligences**

1. Linguistic
2. Logical-mathematical
3. Spatial
4. Musical
5. Bodily-kinesthetic
6. Intrapersonal (knowing yourself)
7. Interpersonal (knowing other people)

**My strongest intelligence**

1. Logical-mathematical intelligence
2. Intrapersonal intelligence
3. Interpersonal intelligence

**How to use multiple intelligences in learning**

- Select learning methods that capitalize on your strongest intelligences.
- Focus your learning on your best areas to make it easier, more rewarding, and more fun.
- Build up skills without expecting too much from yourself by challenging yourself to learn something in an unfamiliar way.
- Combine skills from as many intelligences as possible.
- Learn in a way that is more complete and involving.

**PERSONAL LEARNING-STYLE PROFILE**

1. **TIME.** My best time for learning is morning (9-11 AM), afternoon (3-5 PM), and evening (8-9 PM).
2. **GROUPER OR STRINGER.** I’m a grouper and stringer combination. I like to get an overall view of a subject first then tackle it step-by-step. I think good designed syllabi will work for me, as long as I do the reading, learning, and evaluation myself, and not rely on an expert/teacher or the pace of the class.
3. **LEARNING QUADRANT.** I like generally to learn through feelings. I learn well when I am passionate about what I am studying because it is personally relevant to me or to a mission I believe in. So my preference is to approach a new subject only when it is relevant to me and I am passionate about it. Depending on the subject, my next learning preferences vary. For subjects that I don’t enjoy, I need connection with other learners and a good expert_teacher to compensate the subject’s lack of relevance to my situation. For subjects that interest me but don’t require me to do things in the real world, studying without connecting with other learners is enough with me. In these cases, looking for logical approach to the subject or a sequence prepared by an expert_teacher can complement my initial interest to learning the subject. For subjects that I am very much interested in and have strong relevance to my personal life or mission, I rely heavily on my connection with others and my ability to find quality knowledge. In these situations, I rely less on a single expert or a single way of doing things. I look for different ways of understanding/doing the subject and inject my own creativity to apply what I learn in my specific situation. Generally, I am inclined to following a flexible structure and connecting with others. I am less inclined to learn in a traditional class with someone teaching in a way that don’t appeal to me and someone whose authority I question.
4. **INTELLIGENCES.** My two strongest intelligences are: intrapersonal intelligence and a significant measure of inter-personal and logical-mathematical intelligences. So I enjoy learning most when I find intrinsic values and deep personal satisfaction. I also enjoy learning that enhances my knowledge of myself, that connects me with people, and helps me create a measure of order in my psyche.

**MATCHING YOUR STYLE AND LEARNING RESOURCES**

**Major resources**

- Printed matter
- Experiences
- Media
- Nature
- Other people

**How to match styles and learning resource**

- If you can arrange for your learning to involve the resource that you prefer, you will find the experience more pleasant and more productive.
- Learning with others or learning by yourself?
- Find ways to link up with other learners that are more flexible than having to sign up for a class.

**My preferred resources**

- Books
- Participating in simulations
- Interviewing people in the field
- Videos
- Visiting a place
- Writing letters to solicit information
- Writing a paper or article
- Hands on in-person community activity
- Designing a campaign
- Surveying

**LEARNING MORE ABOUT YOUR LEARNING STYLE**

**How to learn more about your learning style**

- Make notes regularly on your learning style, along with your other ideas, in your learning log.
- Take workshops with some learning style tests with individual counseling.
- Read a book on adult’s learning style (In Their Own Way by Thomas Armstrong)

**How to flex your styles**

- Use the modes of learning that you use least or find least congenial.

**Benefits of flexing your styles**

1. You can be more flexible in situations that require a different learning style.
2. You might discover that an alternative approach works surprisingly well or was neglected because of earlier experiences.
3. Your capacity to communicate with other people who operate in different learning styles will improve.

# 6 - Improving your learning, reading, and memory skills

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056740,120.453584)

Three categories with two techniques each.

Choose the technique in each category that most appeals to you.

Adopt one that might be most apt for the kind of learning you are doing.

**BEFORE LEARNING**

The decisions you make before you start to learn are crucial for your success (effectiveness and enjoyment).

- What do you want to learn?
- Which resources do you want to use?
- When do you want to learn?
- Where do you want to learn?

**Pro-active Reading**

Passive reading

- Starting on page one and read through the end.
- Not quitting before finishing.
- Letting the author’s priorities and choices of what to emphasize take command of your attention.

Active, self-directed, and creative reading

- Doing a preliminary scan of a book’s contents to decide whether it is the right resource.
- Getting an overview of the book before jumping into the details.
- Deciding how much more of what the author wants to present is relevant to your needs.
- Only accessing information and procedures you want.
- Going directly to what you want.
- Skipping around.

Pro-active reading steps

1. **Dust jacket (inside front).** Read what the publisher has to say about the book.
2. **Dust jacket (inside back).** Read what the publisher has to say about the author and his or her qualifications to write such a book.
3. **Front matter (foreword, preface, introduction).** Read the author's or editor's orientation to the book.
4. **Table of contents.** See how the author has organized the information into parts, chapters, or other subsections.
5. **Scan.** Rapidly scan or read the occasional paragraph or heading that interests you. Try to get the feel of the book.
6. **Three questions.** Put the book down and write three questions concerning matters you have become curious about as a result of this preliminary examination.
7. **First question.** Next, review your first question and find in it a key word or phrase that you think might be in the index. Go to the index and look for the key word; if you draw a blank, try to come up with a synonym. If the synonym isn't there, see if the table of contents leads you to where the question can be answered.
8. **Research.** Now turn to that part of the book that deals with your question and look for the answer. If the author refers to material in other parts of the book, follow the leads until you have enough information relevant to your question.
9. **Repeat.** Use the same procedure with your second and third questions.

Using the index

1. Read the index as a graph: the number of pages on which a term is mentioned indicates how much attention is paid to that subject in the book.
2. Spend five minutes to look for the 25 key words for the book (the top 15% of the book).
3. Ask: What are the dozen most important ideas covered inthis book?
4. Ask: Which of these important ideas might provide good starting points for me to get into the book because of my familiarity with them?
5. Ask: What ideas are covered that are entirely new to me, and do they sound intriguing and useful?
6. Ask: Given the above, and my learning goals, do I have enough reason to continue with this book or should I seek information elsewhere?

**Turning any experience into a learning opportunity**

Vee-heuristic Technique

- “Heuristic” - techniques that help us find or discover something.
- Use a little advance planning to make any experience further your learning and enhance your enjoyment of life.

![Screen Shot 2017-10-13 at 4.49.13 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/328545CA-C448-4DC8-9AFC-9A51A4F356A2/256D7A6E-AAC6-49C4-9B67-DAF0B090EE61_2/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-13%20at%204.49.13%20PM.png)

How to use the Vee-heuristic technique

Left side

1. Identify an upcoming experience from which you want to learn.
2. Recall your existing knowledge and understanding and draw on it during the experience.
3. Decide what you’d like to learn from the experience.
4. Formulate interesting, useful, powerful questions you want to answer by learning from the experience.

Right side

1. List some actions you can take to so that the experience yields the answers you seek.

Active involvement during the Vee-heuristic method

- Preparation will make you rethink your focus question.
- Preparation will remind you of some relevant information.
- During or after your experience, you may come up with some new sources of information to pursue.

**DURING LEARNING**

During learning, aspire not to be passively absorbing information.

**Active learning involves**

- Posing questions to yourself.
- Organizing the incoming information to fit your own interests, learning goals, and needs.

**Mind-mapping**

Best for people who

- Have high visual intelligence
- Are stifled by the need to outline subjects in a linear order, one topic after another
- Groupers
- Prefer a more complex overview with branches in many directions

Benefits of mind-mapping

- Visually pattern-oriented
- Open to creative additions at any point
- Encourages us to think about a topic in more directions than simply before and after
- Easy to remember concepts
- Allows us to see connections among widely disparate elements of the subject
- Interconnecting arrows can suggest complex relationships among parts of some idea or field

How to create mind maps

- The rules of mind-mapping are made to be broken
- Create and capture your own thoughts in your own way, reflecting your personal image of the idea you are mapping
- No need to be complete or academically accurate
- The amount and distribution of information is up to the person making the map
- One can always return and add new branches anywhere
- Arrows around the outside show links between various branches
- Create a new mind map for an oval that is emerging as very important to you
- When a mind map gives you an insight or direction, write a summary paragraph capturing the insight

How to use mind maps

- Use the map to remind you of the overall territory you’ve traveled
- Use the keywords to guide your search for further resources
- Pattern of connections (branches and arrows) can tell you what you need to check further or assist your in reformulating a focus question to gain new information
- Pattern can help you organize data in a way more suitable to a standard outline, report, or written essay.

**Probes**

- Questions and ideas before learning much about any new field.
- “Proposition before” - before the text gets to the point, before facts and arguments are presented
- A basic method of scientific experimentation: formulate a hypothesis and test it.

Reasons for using probes

1. Keep your min actively involved with the subject.
2. Provide insight you will miss if you knew a lot about a subject.

When to use probes

- Whenever you begin to sense that the argument is moving too slowly for you.

How to use probes

1. Make notes about what’s coming next.
2. Guess what the text is leading up to.
3. Modify your proposition in light of what you’re reading.

How to use probes when writing

1. Formulate an initial proposition (a concise statement of a familiar or plausible view).
2. Present it as a hypothesis.
3. Examine the evidence to see how well it stands up. This becomes the text of the article. It is a journey by way of evidence and argument from the original to the revised proposition.
4. Formulate a revised proposition (a direct contradiction or a qualification of the initial proposition)

How to come up with probes using prior knowledge

1. Use mind maps and/or the Vee-heuristic technique.
2. Use prior knowledge to formulate focus questions.
3. Use these questions are probes to be tested as you learn.

How to use probes when reading

1. Do pre-noting and Vee-heuristic work before reading a short opening section of the piece.
2. Create probes using the following questions.
3. What is the point of this first section? What is the author trying to say?
4. What past knowledge of or experience with this subject do you have that leads you to suspect where the author is going?
5. Is the author taking a stand on some issue? If so, what kind of supporting evidence or argument do you think will be presented to justify that stand? If no definite position has been presented so far, do you think the author is leading up to some position? How?
6. What kinds of information do you expect the author to present next as relevant to the topic discussed? (Who, what, where, or when something happened? How or why some situation came to be?) What kind of result can be expected with this issue?

AFTER LEARNING

Memory Improvement

Remembering is easy when:

- You are working with information you want and ideas that excite you
- You use the Peak learning approach
- You use the techniques in your self-directed learning process

Strategies to improve memory

1. Choose your own goals. Know why you’re learning. Have an immediate use of your learning.
2. Employ techniques that activate your mind.
3. Get into the “flow” of learning.
4. Invoke your enthusiasm and commitment.
5. Use your strongest style.

# 8 - Designing your optimal learning environment

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056740,120.453584)

# 10 - Setting up your own learning projects

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056740,120.453584)

Make your learning more flexible and powerful by taking control of the process.

Conduct and manage projects guided by your own most important questions about the subject, issue, or problem.

Monitor your learning by reflecting on and applying what you are learning.

Learning takes time, and it often has to happen at the right time. Your knowledge and skills must grow at a natural pace - not be force-fed in a hothouse, high-pressure environment.

**3 key issues for creating a project plan**

1. How to select your learning goals
2. How to choose the best learning resources
3. How to evaluate the results of your learning

**HOW TO SELECT YOUR LEARNING GOALS**

Set your own goals. Define, and refine as you go along, the areas to be covered, in what depth, and with what slant.

**Questions**

To formulate learning goals for your project, respond to whichever of the following categories apply.

1. What knowledge do I want to acquire? What facts, concepts, terms, data, etc. do I seek?
2. What do I want to understand? How do I want to be able to interpret the facts and data? How do I want to apply terms and principles? What reasoning and creative thinking do I want to do?
3. What skills do I want to master? What specific know-how and how-to do I need?
4. What attitudes do I want to develop? What new feelings, convictions, values, or sensitivities do I want to cultivate?

**HOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST LEARNING RESOURCES**

Choosing resources smartly assures you that the materials or opportunities you are using are the best possible ones for you. Rather than just accepting the first or second thing you find available, you’re taking the time to find the best.

**The Five Percent Upfront principle**

Take 5 percent of the time you will be spending using the resource to evaluate it in terms of your goals, style, and circumstances.

**How to choose a book**

1. Choose among 3 or 4 books.
2. Research around 12 reviews by leading experts on the topic for each book.
3. Note how the author is regarded by his or her peers.
4. Note how the experts reviewed the contents of the book from several points of view.
5. Note any major flaws or prejudices that you should be aware of.
6. Choose one from the 3 or 4 books to spend your time on.
7. Use the techniques in Chapter 6 for pro-active reading

**HOW TO EVALUATE THE RESULTS OF YOUR LEARNING**

The process is the product.

In peak learning, learning, evaluation, and application are combined, not separate.

Your goals and results are defined in action terms. These actions will occur during the process of learning itself.

**Learning by doing**

- Keep on doing it as well as you can
- Have good models to follow
- Have helpful advice if and when you feel like you need it

**Measurements of learning**

Measure your learning by standards growing out of the learning itself.

- Tangible product
- Less tangible but equally important (a new awareness, a sense of community)
- A change wrought in other people’s lives
- Accomplishments
- Capabilities
- Social effects
- Strengthened sensitivities
- Convictions

**How to build your own credentials**

1. Maintain a complete portfolio of material you produced.
2. Describe the particular tasks you undertook for production of the material
3. Compare your speed/process with others
4. List people who can verify your portfolio and description of abilities.

By keeping careful track of what you have actually done and produced, you are making yourself aware about what you want to learn next.

**USING A LEARNING PROJECT PLAN**

1. Choose your own goals.
- Clarify them as you start learning.
- Refine or change them as you proceed.
- Add new areas as your perspective broadens.
- Put your other goals on hold as you focus on a narrow topic.
2. Marshall your full energy and enthusiasm.
- Engage the subject at the right level of challenge and style.
- Enter the flow state.
3. Take full advantage of your prior knowledge, experience, and attitudes about your subject.
- Start from your unique point of leverage and confidence.
4. Fine tune your environments.
- Learn in the best place.
- Learn at the best times.
- Learn at the best conditions.
5. Use your own style.
- “Feel” your way into the subject.
- Become aware of the ways available to learn it.
- Match learning opportunities and resources with your own style.
6. Benefit from a wide range of resources and opportunities.
- From each of them, take the element that’s of most interest to you.
7. Control your time.
- Slow down your learning.
- Speed up your learning.
- Adapt your schedule to your changing life circumstances.
8. Use innovative learning techniques to process what you’re learning in active, personal ways.
9. Benefit from change, luck, and intuition.
10. Determine what results you want from your learning.
- Measure them in the ways most congenial and productive for you.
