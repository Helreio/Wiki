# I think importante rin talaga na ang mahanap mong partner eh medyo parehas kayo ng lifestyle na gusto.

I mean I know that love could conquer all etc. pero finding someone who has similar sensibilities on money will make things a lot easier in a relationship.

For example, the fund is meant to compensate for shared expenses tama? Then the size of that fund depends on the total of each other's expenses. Now what if one partner is super frugal and the other is super luxurious in terms of, say, food? That means that expenses will grow just because the other's expenses is bigger. Now this will affect the frugal partner because he will have to work more hours to have money for the big fund.

Now what if the frugal partner is frugal because he wants to spend less time working and more time, say, doing art? Because he loves that. It makes him come alive. Just because he has a partner who is luxurious, he will have to sacrifice time for art for time for working so that he could compensate for the big fund.

This wont be a problem in this case if the luxurious partner will agree that she will give more to the fund because her needs are bigger. If she'll agree then the frugal partner will be able to maintain the amount of working hours and therefore continue to do art.
