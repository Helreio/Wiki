Nonseparation

- That the universe, me, and other people are interconnected or are one.

Focus

- Scientific validations
- Its application on healing
- Its application on flourishing
- Its application on economics
- Its application on social change

::My mission is::

- ::to be convinced that it is true::
- to contribute to social change through personal application of the philosophy
- to help others realize this and put it to life

Maybe continuing education can help but it isn't a requirement. It can even derail the time I could have spent on the 3 main components of the mission. There are alternatives to continuing education and I might explore them first before I consider going back to school where I will be forced by another person what to read, write, and study.
