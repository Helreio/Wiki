# How to setup a spaced repetition writing system in Craft

Here is how to setup a [[Spaced repetition writing system]] in [[craft]].

1. Use the Inbox of Craft as your [[writing inbox]].
2. Create a note entitled [[Spaced repetition writing system]] in Craft.
3. Write the following in the note.
   - Fruitful: (Every Monday and Thursday)
   - Skipped: (Every Tuesday)
   - Unfruitful: (Every other Wednesday)
   - Suspended: (Suspended ideas, review at will)
1. For each tag, create its own document.
2. In Google Calendar, create recurring events for each of the tags. Title the events as tasks, e.g., "Process Fruitful notes". Set the dates for the tags according to the intervals above.
3. Sync Google Calendar with the Mac's native Calendar app.
4. Sync the Calendar app with Things so that Things will show the event on the given day.

When starting out, you probably have this entire collection of notes in your writing inbox. Review around five notes a day. Here, you can use the sorting function to either start from old or new notes. But choose just one order.

When processing individual notes, work on one note at a time and then update its tag as instructed in [[How to use a spaced repetition writing system in Craft]] (start at Step 3).
