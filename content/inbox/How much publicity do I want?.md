# How much publicity do I want?

It seems clear that I want some of it, but how much?

I want to make a difference in the lives of a few people without fame crippling me.

What's most important to me is my own understanding, my own perception of myself.

Then some feeling of usefulness to other people and the bliss of company with them.

And I think that's it. I really don't want fame although that thing within me is always there. But I know I cant handle it.

So focus on

- The personal work
- Creating things I know I can be proud of
- Making a difference to an intimate number of people
- Enjoying the company of colleagues
- Enjoying the company of followers
- Thats it
