# The main goal is ginhawa

Because the main goal is simply through survive this transitory meaningless life comfortably.

This goal is subjective. It is mine alone. It can never be objective. Therefore I can't prescribe it to anyone. I can try as long as I don't commit duplicity.

So with my writing and work, is my goal to convince anyone?

No. My goal is just to survive. And part of surviving is having and holding on to meaning. A project impossible if one does not engage oneself to thinking in any measure
