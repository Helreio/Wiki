# Philosophical practice as contemplative philosophy

# Four fundamentall different visions of philosophizing

There are three visions of practicing philosophy. Each visions are fundamentally different from each other. These visions are:

1. Problem-solving
2. Wisdom-inspired
3. Critical-reasoning
4. Platonic

# The problem-solving vision of philosphizing

This is also called the “therapeutic approach” of philosophizing. In this practice, the goal of the practitioner is to use philosophy to develop solutions for specific problems encountered by a client in daily life to alleviate suffering.

In this context, philosophy ceases to be a critic of society and becomes a participant in the market economy. A problem-solving philosopher prioritizes the goals that their clients want to achieve—i.e., of what the market needs—over the quest for [[thoughts/wisdom]].

This kind of philosophical practice is best represented by [[Alain de Botton]] and [[The School of Life]] (perhaps even [[Practical philosophy]] in general.

This vision fills in a gaping void and pursuing it makes philosophy more relevant and useful. It’s like [[Applied philosophy]]. But it is important to be very mindful of its limitations and to clearly deliniate its difference from other visions of philosophizing. For example, its goals are fundamentally different from [[The wisdom-inspired vision of philosophizing]]

# The wisdom-inspired vision of philosophizing

The goal of a wisdom-inspired vision of philosophizing is to cultivate wonder and perplexity. It desires a worldview that is complex and enriched.

To understand this vision, one needs to understand what wisdom is and how it becomes the main goal of this vision of philosophizing.

# The critical-reasoning vision of philosophizing

In this vision of philosophical practice, one’s goal is to improve one’s worldview by critically examining and analyzing it so it becomes more acceptable to oneself. In short, the goal is to improve self-understanding. It is different from the problem-solving approach in that it does not aim to solve a specific problem. Instead, its goal is simply to sharpen one’s worldview. The resolution of a specific problem because of a clearer worldview is only a by-product and not a direct result of this approach. This means that this vision is facilitative in nature.

The downside of a heavy emphasis on critical-reasoning is that it is insufficient to inspire self-transformation. It helps one understand one’s current worldview but it is too analytical and critical to provide enough resources to transcend that worldview.

This vision is heavily influenced by a misguided Western idea that the sole purpose of philosophy is to validate and invalidate ideas through abstract reasoning. I do think that abstract reasoning plays an important role in convincing us in making up or changing our minds. However, to say that we change our minds through reason alone is too arrogant a claim.

The truth is that abstract reasoning, i.e., examining ideas to determine whether they are acceptable or not, is not enough to convince us to take action or to change our minds and our lives. We respond to abstract reasoning not because of it but because something inarticulate within us made us more receptive of it. This interaction of the articulated and the inarticulate produces the transformation. The inarticulate is this collection of psychological backlogs that make us who we are.

# A philosophical practice is both philosophical and feelosophical

A holisitic philosophical practice is not dedicated to reason alone. It recognizes that action does not happen through reason alone but through it and emotion and all the other inarticulated contents of the mind.

Therefore, a complete philosophical practice is one where we think about our understandings and live them concretely. It is a dialogue between reason, emotion, that parts of us before we differentiated between the two, and our entirety as a human being.

# The Platonic vision of philosophizing

A philosophical practice should be holistic, i.e., philosophical and feelosophical. Therefore, the goal is still to make philosophy practical, to make it applicable, and relevant. But instead of using it to solve everyday problems, another way of practicing philosophy is to use it to transcend the preoccupation on usual desires and incorporate deeper and novel ways of understanding and living.

The goal of philosophizing is to develop within us a yearning for truth and wisdom, to transcend everyday, limited understanding, and create a greater vision of life.

(Connect Transcend by Scott Barry Kaufman and the research on transcenders)

This Platonic philosophizing is a contemplative philosophical practice where one attends to life and responds to it (i.e., relates to oneself and the world) from depth understanding—understanding from both verbalized and inarticulated sources. Depth undersanding is what inspires us to think, feel, and act in a particular way that pure reasoning cannot do.

The goal of our philosophical practice is to understand all parts of ourselves as a whole, not just our thougths, and express our understanding in daily life.

To do this, it is essential to create an inner space of listening to ourselves, uncluttered by our automatic thoughts. Once we have this space, we approach information intentionally differently. Instead of critical analysis, we use philosophical text as prompts for depth understanding.

# Depth understanding

Understanding that is oftentimes cannot be articulated because it is more than words (combination of emotion, words?)

Depth underatanding cannot really be captured by a theory. It has to be explored and experienced. To create a theory of depth understanding is to reduce it to abstract thinking. We have to avoid this to not reduce philosophical practice to mere critical thinking.

# Methods for depth understanding

You can use meditative techniques, but it is useless to assume that a certain organized method is the only way to understand deeply.

Religious tranditions are familiar with it and have developed them. We have to develop them in a philosophical direction (i.e., secular, agnostic, does not assume metaphysically). Examples: Catholic Lectio Divina

Project: Explore traditions and ways of relating to texts and ideas that turn philosophy into a contemplative quest—a process that engages our depth understanding.

When philosophical practice is transformed into a contemplative practice, a practicitoner is not a professional whose training is done. Practice is a never-ending process. Our first priority is to work on ourselves before working with and on others.

People in a similar path are not colleagues but companions. Out interactions with them should not be purely theoretical. We should create contemplative-philosophical interactions with them.
