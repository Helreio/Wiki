# MLTP 16 - Standards

3 am person

- Us vs the world

Standards and compatibility test

- Early on after the breakup
- So that the insights are not gone
- Commit to it long before you start to date

Dont look for sparks

Sparks are your dysfunctions saying hi to each other

U dont see true love on the first date

What needs to change in you

- Look in you deeply and decide what truly needs to change

You could adjust your standards for the right person

Its easy to not be choosy about who to have a relationship with if you dont make a commitment to your standards

Create a list that takes care of you

Things that are nice to have but are negotiable

Be aware that the universe of people that fits ur standards is small.

So know ur priorities. Prioritize emotional maturity and communication. Others can be negotiable.

Base standard: Wants to be with me.

Second standard: Treats me well.

- Both are non negotiable

If she doesnt want to be with me, she shouldnt come back in your life.

Ur partner must be responsible and have all things covered.

Dont think will they like me.

Think will i like them.

Don't fight over stupid things.

Identify your priorities.

You dont have to reveal everything about your life.

Think the right time to drop revelations. Not too early not too late.

The healthier you become the less people will become the right partner for you.

U will never meet ur 3 am person if u keep hanging out with the wrong people

Reveal urself slowly to the right people for the right reasons
