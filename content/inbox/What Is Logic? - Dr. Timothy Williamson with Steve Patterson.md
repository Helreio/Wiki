# What Is Logic? - Dr. Timothy Williamson with Steve Patterson

Logic is about broad generalizations about how things are

The most fundamental questions we are asking have right and wrong answers

Dialetheism: accept contradictions to create more beautiful theories about how the world is

If we change how we use language instead changing fundamental logical truths applied to wide areas of knowledge, like dilethiests do, we can create better theories.

It is possible to work with theories that don’t make sense. Alternative theories are still meaningful even if they are inaccurate.

Is there a reason for taking alternative theories seriously? Yes.

Logical paradoxes are really hard to solve. They demand seriousness. Their solution has to be strange.

We need to treat alternative theories with respect to give justice to the problems they are trying to answer without going to contradictions.

Steve: There is no concept that exists prior to the conception of the concept.

Timothy: A conception before even it is conceived already has a non-spatial existence. The possibility of thinking about a concept is there even when someone has not conceived of it yet.

On Certainty

Timothy: There are no concepts that are certain in all situations.

Dogmatism is not an appropriate attitude to have.

One must have a disposition to question things that one has been confident of.

There are logical laws we’re confident about but we shouldn’t dismiss alternative theories.

The case of logic shows that progress can be made when we doubt things that we’ve taken as truths and allowed other views.

If you hold on beliefs with 100% no doubt, there are probably a lot of things that you will believe which are false.

Steve: Middle ground. Most things I’m uncertain. But there is a small subset that I’m certain about.

**What is logic?**

Logic is about fundamental rules of reality.

Logic is the rules of existence.

**Are there different forms of logic?**

No. The answers to our fundamental questions are yes or no.

Believing that there are true contradictions is the farthest you can get from the truth.

Championing contradictions do not deserve politeness.

Academics are polite to their fellow academics despite their claims because they are part of the system.

We should listen to people who contradict themselves to understand how language is used, but to recognize that their views are good is extremely polite.

Dialetheists revise fundamental logical principles. We should change how we use language instead of what we certainly know about reality.

The Liar’s Paradox is an elementary error about our use of language.

Group think is dangerous. The pursuit of truth has to be an individual, not a communal, quest.

Sometimes concepts don’t have their referents (ie. numbers)

My Notes

While timothy believes that logic is fundamental, he is unwilling to take a certain stance because he thinks it isn’t right.

He is appealing to attitude. I believe we can be reasonable and kind at the same time.

See: even how we should “use” and “impose” certain truths is influenced by our personalities.

Steve is aggressively against arguments that are logically contracting.
