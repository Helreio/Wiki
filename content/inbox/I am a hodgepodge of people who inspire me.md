# I am a hodgepodge of people who inspire me

I am a hodgepodge of [[People who inspire me]].

I espouse [James Clear](craftdocs://open?blockId=A0914B11-A194-472A-9116-E349DEA7B254&spaceId=63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8)'s dedication for self-improvement and I steal his main question “How to live?” (which is also the main question of The School of Life by [[Alain de Botton]]).

I share [[Steve Patterson]]'s dedication for honesty and truth.

Even if I want to focus on generating good ideas, [[Austin Kleon]] breaks my monotony and reminds me to integrate play and creative freedom into my workflow.

I also am influenced by the writing styles, simplicity, and connection to nature of [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]] and [[Ben Hewitt]].
