# A Minimum Viable Worldview

A worldview is useless by itself.

It has to inspire action.

A worldview could inform action.

Should I wait for me to understand everything before I act?

No. I could act now with the minimum amount of knowledge that I have. As long as thet knowledge is fundamentally accurate.

What am I certain about that should be part of my worldview?

Interconnection

Nonviolence
