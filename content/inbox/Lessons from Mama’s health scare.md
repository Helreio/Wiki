# Lessons from Mama’s health scare

1. I will do everything for my mom. I don’t mind working extra hours just to save her or her quality of life. My selflessness has expanded.
2. There are nuances in asking for help. Before we aks for help, we need to ask ourselves if we can solve the problem ourselves. When we can’t, that’s the time we expand. But we need to do so conservatively—to as few people as possible. When the situation is severely bad, that’s the time we do a full-scale campaign.
3. I need to open an intimate channel of communication with my parents. Each of them needs to have someone who knows what they are feeling when they are suffering.
4. I need to take care of my health as early as now.
5. I need to work on my health insurance.
6. I need to find a way to address future health emergencies (e.g., build a health fund or search for programs they can apply to).
