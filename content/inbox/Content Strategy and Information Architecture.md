# Content Strategy and Information Architecture

Content strategy

- What content should go on the website?
- Is it aligned with the major and minor goals of the website?

Information architecture

- How should we structure that content?

Steps

1. Content planning
2. Content developing

Content planning

1. Come up with the list of content that should be in the site
   - Examples
      - Contact
      - Resources
      - Blog
      - Signup for newsletters
1. Brainstorm content and tone
2. Sort and group to pages
   - Do card sorting
   - What will be the title of the group? That will be the page name

How to structure content

Information architecture because a website is a space.

- How we arrange a space impacts how we use it
- A space can be confusing or easy to navigate

Use people’s expectations and use good signage.

The tool to create structure is called a sitemap (sometimes tabs or bullet points are enough and faster).

Types of structures

1. Single page
   1. All content is in one page
2. Flat structure
   1. You can only navigate forward and backward on a page
   2. Example: checkout pages
3. Index page
   1. One page links to other pages in a website
4. Strict hierarchy pattern
   1. One page links to other pages with pages under them
5. Co-existing hierarchy pattern (most complex)
   1. You can move around among the subpages without going back to the pages.

One-page vs. multi-page

One-page

Pros

- Intuitive user journey (all you do is scroll)
- Includes all the info the user needs to make a decision
- Higher conversions

Cons

- Not awesome for SEO or analytics
   - It’s difficult to know what people are interested in.
- Not scalable

Multi-page

Pros

- Unlimited scalability
- Easier to link to specific content
- Better SEO

Cons

- Harder to maintain
- Might get confusing
- Multiple entry points
   - Will a visitor who lands in a specific page know where to go next?

Common website components

Homepage

Purpose

1. Answer: Who are they? What do they do?
2. Build trust: Who worked with them?
3. Has anything changed?

Typical structure

Hero

- Logo & navigation
- Value proposition
- Primary call to action

Secondary

- Trust indicators
   - Testimonials
   - Client or investor logos
   - Social proof
- Benefits
- Features

Additional

- Content (blog)
- Updates (events, news)
- Offers (signup, free stuff)
- Footer

Hompage

Note

- A lot of people won't start at the homepage
- Don’t try to do it all (simplicity and clarity are key)

Navigation

Purpose

1. Who owns this site? (Logo)
2. Where am I?
3. What’s in here?
4. Persistent CTA (optional)

Best practices

1. Logo on top left (links to homepage)
2. 5-7 navigation links
3. If it’s a page-heavy site then links can drop down to reveal more links.
4. Organize links by importance (most important in the left first).
5. Current page highlighted.

Navigation vs Utilities

It’s a good idea to separate utilities from the navigation using position, color, or hierarchy.

Global vs local navigation

- Global
- Local
- Local persistent

Page name

- Highlight it in navigation
- Make it explicit on the page

Using breadcrumbs

Do you need a search function?

- If you have lots of content, it might be useful especially if it’s too hard to look for something.
- If it’s easier to get to the content without a search function, then don’t use it.

Hero section

1. 15 seconds: What is this or who owns this place? (Logo); What do they do? Why should I care?
2. Value proposition
3. CTA

Testimonials

- Used to inspire trust
- Shows users who customers are
- Allows users to explain to users how your product works and its benefits

Best practices for testimonials

- Keep them short
- Include credentials (photo, title, company, etc.)
- Social testimonials are super valuable because they are natural
- Video testimonials are the best since they can’t be faked and they demonstrate effort inspired by trust

The logo bar

- Clients
- Publication
- Awards

Ensure consistent hierarchy by equalizing logos. Flatten the color of each logo. Change sizes.

# Forms

- Short as possible
- Labels aligned top left (always display)
- Use placeholders (give example)

# Contact page

- Finding this page should be very easy.
- Contact form should be short.
- Also give direct email and phone
- Includes a help center or FAQs
- Do you need a map? Address?

# Footer

- Where to look for all possible pages
- Good for sitemap or SEO
- Add privacy terms
- Social media links
- Another CTA, maybe secondary?

# Content development process

# Notes on writing for the web

1. In the web, we don't read. We scan.
2. Write short paragraphs.
3. Headlines are what will be read. Put your efforts on them.
4. Use subheadings.
5. Use bullet points or lists.
6. Remove purposeless words. Make your writing concise.
7. Write to solve a problem.
8. Write for them, not you.

Proofread

- Eliminate errors and add polish.
- Use Grammarly or Wordtune.
- Ask clients to proofread as well.

# Sitemap

1. List all content
2. Card sort
3. Create diagram

# Summary

1. Does the website content help us achieve the goal?
2. Is the content structured in a way that makes it easy for the user to find what they need?
3. Is the content optimized for web consumption?
