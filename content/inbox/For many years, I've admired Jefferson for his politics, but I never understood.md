# For many years, I've admired Jefferson for his politics, but I never understood

For many years, I've admired Jefferson for his politics, but I never understood why he had such a romantic view of farming and the simple life. Now I'm starting to get it. I guess that means I'm getting old.

The problem, as I see it, is people. Vain and anxious humans that lose their individuality in city life. They compensate by desperately competing with each other to try and stand out, making everybody miserable around them.

They create pompous hierarchies, meaningless titles, and shower themselves with accolades in an attempt to patch over their psychological problems. Their lives are driven by achieving the appearance of success, rather than actual fulfillment. They're so distracted and miserable, they've little chance of finding happiness and harmony.

When you're young, playing that game seems exciting and attractive - especially if you're single and looking for a mate. But once that drive is sate, the busy life looks tragic. People fluttering around, confused, angry, empty, without any meaningful connections in their lives, walking down paths that don't end in satisfaction.

Better to leave the bustle, discover what you are, figure out what matters in life, then live accordingly.
