Telephoto improves quality when zooming in

Aperture

- the lower the number, the better the quality in low light.
- the lower the number, the more blurred the background is when you focus on a subject

Dual optical image stabilization

- prevents blurriness when your hand moves a little when taking a photo

Portraid mode with advanced bokeh and Depth Control

- bokeh are the circle lights
- depth control: change the aperture of a photo to blur what’s behind it even more “after” you’ve taken the photo

Smart HDR

- Takes three photos: one with the shadows, highlights, and midtones and then combines them. It does this really quick.

When to use live photos vs burst

- Use burst if you know for sure that it would be an action photo
- If you missed the shot, the live photo will be there.

Portrait mode is best used for people whose edges won’t be very blurred.

Snapseed

Ambiance is almost a smarter way of brightening up an image. Try which makes an image better: ambiance or brightness.

Use structure to improve details of backgrounds not faces for portraits.

Curves are very complicated. Just use the presets and see how they adjust the picture.

Fixing perspective is not good at Snapseed. It is better done in another app.

Steps

1. Fix the white balance first.
2. Then tune image (go through each slide).
3. Then details.
4. Portait
5. Lens blur (When brushing, it’s okay to hit the object. Just use erase to fix it. Erase = o)
6. Curves (choose presets)
