# Be the Gateway Notes

**An audience lives according to narratives**

This is how they express their identity. They want a narrative that makes sense of the world. It is not just a reflection on the world, but their place within it. It justifies their decisions. It allays their fears. It motivates their hopes.

Understand the narratives your audience live by so you can engage them.

**How to be a gateway**

Understand your audience’s narrative.

Understand your narrative

Align the two

**How to find your narratives**

identify what matters most to you across your entire life, not just in your creative work.

think about what you would fight to not lose. Those are your narratives. This is where you will put your energy every day, every week, and every month. It is where you will keep that flame alive long after others would have given up.

Your narratives are made up of two things:

1. The things in life that you care so much about that you would fight to protect them, and to ensure that they can reach their full potential.
2. A practice. What yo do every single day.

**Craft a mission statement**

identify a simple sentence that focuses on the experience you want your writing to create for others

Nine months after someone reads your book, what do you want them to think quietly in their heads about the world you have opened for them? How does it relate to their life, their identity, their interactions?

Write down a series of belief statements—things that you feel resonate in your creative work. Sit with them for a week, reviewing them each day.

at the end of the week, choose one that you are drawn to the most.

**How to write your bio**

1. Write a belief statement that your ideal reader would read and say “YES! This!”
   1. Starting with this instead of yourself shows empathy, which catches the attention of your audience.
   2. The belief statement should embody your work and your drive to create. Examples:
      1. It is either what you are fighting for or fighting against.
      2. A feeling you want people to experience through your work.
2. Write a description of your creative work.
   1. Focus on the one thing that matters to you right now.
3. Write your credentials as they relate to your creative work.
   1. This can take the form of a story of how you got into your craft.
4. Write your background and experience as filtered through your creative work.
5. Share personal details: hobies, location, personal history.

**Take small actions that are totally within your control.**

Seek small conversations.

Seek tiny ways of helping.

Have meaningful conversations with people who will care about your vision.

**How to be truly empathetic in engaging your audience**

find and explore the path that your ideal audience already knows and walks along every day

have empathy for who they are, what they already know, their habits, their interests, and who they trust.

understanding them and their marketplace, and using that to hone how to communicate about the work you create. It helps you identify where you need to be, what engages others, and who you need to know. It also helps ensure that this is fun and meaningful for both you and them.
