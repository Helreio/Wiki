# Walking lengthens time

[[thoughts/walking]], when done at the right pace, slowly and in long hours, can lengthen time. This is one way that [[Walking changes your perspective]]. When walking fast, time passes more quickly. When you [[Walk slowly]] at normal speed, especially when done in long excursions, you lengthen your time because it allows you to me more mindful of your surroundings. [[Walking deepens space]].
