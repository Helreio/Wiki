# Actions can only be categorized based on their purposes.

There are only two clear categories of actions based on their purpose:

1. Actions directed towards the benefit of others with the intention of gaining a benefit for oneself (a transaction/exchange)
2. Actions directed towards the benefit of others without the expectation of a return or towards the benefit of the self alone (a gift)
