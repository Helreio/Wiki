Three types of entrepreneurs

1. Business entrepreneur
2. Political entrepreneur
3. Cultural entrepreneur

What binds all of them?

You need to develop tolerance if you want peace.

In creating cultural icons (e.g., Jollibee and its playhouse), the bulk of the work is in the beginning. But once it gains cultural capital, it is easier.

Indigenous worldviews follow a similar patter with modern worldviews. All worldviews follow the similar pattern.

Everything has a story, and wherever there is a story, there is cultural capital that can be used for entrepreneurship.

Cultual entrepeneurship is better than social entrepreneurship.

Kapag masa ang clients mo, dapat naiintindihan ka nila.
