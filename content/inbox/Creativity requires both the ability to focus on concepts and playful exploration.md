# Creativity requires both the ability to focus on concepts and playful exploration

Whatever you do, it will be either art or science or both. In both aras, you will use creativity. Either way, you will be more effective and satisfied if you use both focussed and fleeting attention. Creativity requires both the ability to focus on concepts and playful exploration. You need to be able to transition between focus and play. You need to be both a sage and a child.

According to [[Jeremy Dean]] (2013, 152): "The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame."

In order to do so, you need to have a flexible strategy that facilitates the easy transition between these two states of mind because [[Flexibility requires an equally flexible work structure]].

To do

- Connect and develop the metaphor of being a sage and a child.
