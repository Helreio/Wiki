Early Retirement Extreme: The ten-year update

“Central to my philosophy was the renaissance ideal of spending your life mastering a productive level of competence in a broad range of subjects. This arsenal of “renaissance skills” would then be combined into a mutually reinforcing web-of-goals, which made living more interesting and balanced — but also more cost- and resource-efficient and resilient in the face of the growing complexities and uncertainties of the 21st century.”

“I continued to follow the ERE principles in the spirit of the renaissance ideal with the goal of solving other big problems. Being financially independent (FI), I no longer require any compensation even if I still appreciate it — if nothing else than just to keep score or divert the lucre towards more useful purposes (e.g. supporting people on”

“However, following the systems-based web-of-goals approach, it's really hard to answer that in a way that satisfies linear formats.”

“I follow many different leads and do many different things — often concurrently — and sometimes in ways where they combine and result in new, unexpected opportunities (the serendipity effect).”

“the ERE strategy is to learn something and add value to the process and its environment, a side-effect of which is that I usually don't have to pay to solve problems and that I sometimes get paid. As a consequence, my spending also remains ridiculously low.”

“So, initially I played a lot of sports.”

“Now, I mainly do BeachBody-type workouts: Insanity, Max30, Asylum, Tapout. It's free, easy, and it keeps me active. I achieved six-pack abs for the first time in my life in my early forties! Another fun exercise is jump roping. I can do double unders, running crosses, heel taps, boxer step, and seamless forward backward reverses.”

“I spent three or four days each week practicing Japanese swordfighting for three years.”

“Meanwhile, I taught myself bicycle repair.”

“I mostly used Park's Blue Book, Zinn's guides, and youtube videos to teach myself. Bicycle repair is fantastic for those of us who come from a white-collar background with zero practical skills, because bicycle repair is mostly solving closed-end problems.”

“They connected me with the sailing community in the San Francisco bay.”

“Why bother explaining if the audience always sees it as a starting point for a win-lose debate rather than an opportunity to learn?

It's also possible that I've just grown tired of arguing. I’ve thought a lot about how we all take roles in that particular dynamic on social media thereby affecting what it's possible to learn from each other. I feel less inclined to share insights than I used to.”

“I taught myself woodworking using hand tools, which is mentally different from the machine-thinking I was used to. This process developed slowly and took years, but it came in handy being a homeowner. I can design and build properly-sized furniture and I can make replacement parts and fix free furniture.”

“Lately, I've been interested in toolmaking. I think being able to build one's own tools is the real measure of mastery of one's field.”

“We plowed up (actually laboriously double-dug with a spade) much of our backyard lawn to install a vegetable garden. The ultimate goal is to develop some level of self-reliance beyond just having access to free organic vegetables every summer/fall. This has been a good reminder that we (or at least I) definitely don't want to be homesteaders. It's funny how buying a homestead is so popular in the FIRE community that it almost seems like a rite of passage. Maybe homesteading attracts exuberant personalities in search of projects? We almost bought one in rural Oregon in 2011. I'm glad we didn't because maintenance is just not for me.”

“Similar to bicycle repair, this skill allows one to fix things for oneself, neighbors, and friends, but it is hard to make real money on it due to the competition.”

“My general prescription for a successful job-free life is to find activities that cover the combination of meaning+fun and theoretical+practical — albeit not necessarily at the same time. But it's important to touch all of those dimensions from time to time even it it involves a job.”

“For example, building a working clock out of plywood is practical and fun and perhaps a bit theoretical as well…but definitely not meaningful in the grand scheme of things. However, it checks some of the checkbox combinatorics. In the long run, meaning is more important than fun though!”

“The search for meaning (over comfort) was a big reason I quit my physics career. I wanted to focus on writing the ERE blog.”

“When blogging, I was breaking new ground (many aspects of commonly accepted FIRE philosophy today were still pretty original ten years ago) and changing peoples' lives on a daily basis. (At least, that's what the comments and emails told me!) Quitting astrophysics to write about early retirement thus checked the box of meaningfulness that my academic research lacked.”

“I would much rather focus on solutions that could be immediately implemented at the field level, like ERE, than advise, debate, research, educate, or engage in activism. Ultimately, “big change” needs people filling all roles, but now I have a better idea of the role I optimally fill.”

“Thinking back, I faded from the energy resource scene for similar reasons that I left the non-profit. Sticking to thinking up actionable solutions at the individual level just works better for me. I'm writing this down as a reminder to myself to stay focused on my current project. Tempting as it is to focus on different ways of solving problems — raising awareness, etc. — I am fundamentally interested in individually actionable solutions.”

“In a given year, I read more than 100 books. Most of these are technical/non-fiction in order to gain useful insights or learn more stuff.

After reading a few thousand, the ROI of reading or “book learning” is near the top end of the S-curve for me. This is also the case for striving towards being a master of many trades in general.”

“The downsides of the renaissance ideal as measured at the 10-year milestone in my experience? It becomes harder to enjoy being a spectator. It's also harder to appreciate bought experiences along with and in the company of others. This is not necessarily a virtue or a good thing by the way!”

“I think this holds true for all kinds of experiences.”

“Learning new skills. Making things yourself. Earning money in new and different ways like hourly, salaried, royalties, investing, trading. Interacting with other people whether it be by helping, getting helped, giving, getting, selling, buying. I could go on, but you know what I mean, right?”

“Those $150/person restaurant meals — again, I appreciate the gesture — become hard to enjoy once you're able to create a superior meal (as measured by your personal preferences) for far less.”

“(Free semi-retirement tip: There are a lot of overly-educated, semi-retired people working in tax-prep because it's seasonal, reasonably well paid, and the co-workers tend to be interesting!)”

“My spending has remained around the $7000 per year mark for almost twenty years now. Since we got married thirteen years ago, my wife's spending has also hovered around the $7000 per year mark. In other words, our combined expenses total about $14,000 per year.

The continual addition of new skills and skill-synergies has allowed us to stretch each dollar further and further in terms of what we get from spending it. We still tend to specialize individually, but as a unit comparative advantage works for us.”

“I can do many things competently. Ditto my wife for many other things. Together, we're rather self-reliant (to put it mildly). Spending money mainly serves to resolve friction from inefficient lifestyle design. And for us, there's just not a whole lot of friction left anymore except real-estate, taxes, and insurance premiums, which account for nearly 60% of our budget. We consider spending money a failure to solve our problems by smarter means.”

“But our failure rate is getting quite low at this point.”

“Our present situation could easily be confused for a mundane suburban middle-class existence…except most of what we own has not been acquired by spending.”

“For historical reasons, my wife and I have kept our savings separate while splitting our income. There are lots of different ways to arrange financial matters, and attitudes vary a lot depending on whatever antediluvian norms anyone grew up under. This is just what we decided back then — mainly because it made tax accounting easy — and we're still happy with it.”

“Both of us have contributed much more to society producing things than we've taken out by consuming them. Neither of us need to work anymore. Nor do we feel any reason to spend more. It's not money but skills and imagination that comprise the limiting factor when operating at this level.”

“As a couple, both of us being FI makes it a lot easier to solve the “two-body” problem that academics are annoyingly familiar with: In choosing where to go, we take turns with who gets to do a “location-specific project” next.”

“While FIRE solves the freedom-from problem, ERE’s renaissance concept also solves the freedom-to issue, because the limiting factor in enjoying post-work life is seldom money but skill, connections, and the amazing opportunities they generate.”

“ERE was designed as a continually-evolving system that aims at efficiency and resilience for the 21st century. Within this system, FI just happens as a side-effect of being compensated for adding value to the system while reducing the need and desire to spend. Basically, a two-fer.”

“Focusing on adding value creates plenty of experiences and things to try and do, which I hope to have illustrated above. Effectively, it looks very different from traditional forms of retirement”
