# Relationships - Alain de Botton

We live in an era of Romanticism

Soulmate

⁃ marry by instinct (“special feeling”)

Romanticism has prevented us to experience real love.

If we want to experience real love we have to be less loyal to many romantic notions

If our goal is long-term relationships

Rise of Romantics = Decline of Religion

If you are working on an ideology that everyone is by nature perfect -> Self-righteousness

All of us are by nature deeply crazy.

WE ARE BOTH GOOD AND DISTORTED.

We don’t need people in relationships to be perfect. We need them to have a handle on their imperfections.

What we look for from a partner is someone who is “familiar”

Romanticism

⁃ High regard to the concept of honesty

⁃ I need to be myself fully

Truth: Being yourself is a treat that you should spare anyone that you claim to love

We can’t entirely be ourselves to our partner not because we’re hiding something but because in the name of love we can’t entirely be ourselves.

Revealing everything about us will destroy them.
