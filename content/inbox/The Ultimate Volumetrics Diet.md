# The Ultimate Volumetrics Diet

# Introduction

Fill your day with plenty of enjoyable, healthful foods that are lower in calorie density (pack with fewer calories into each bite) to leave you feeling full and satisfied.

Managing weight is not about:

- Cutting fat or carbohydrates
- Cutting out whole food groups

Managing weight is about:

- Eating a variety of nutritious foods that help control calories
- Finding positive strategies that will lead to sustainable, healthy eating and activity patterns that fit your lifestyle.

The Ultimate Volumetrics Diet

- Think positively about what you can eat.
- Eat fewer calories than your body uses as fuel for your activities.
- When you are managing calories, it is more important than ever to eat a good balance of food and nutrients.
- Choose food that will help control hunger and enhance satiety.
- Fit your favorite foods into your diet.
- Choose eating and activity patterns that you can sustain for a lifetime of achieving your own healthy weight.

How to reduce calorie density (calorie per bite)?

- Eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, soups, and salads.
- Eat more modest portions of lower-fat dairy products and meat.
- Do this without sacrificing taste.
- Make room for your favorite indulgences—in moderation.

Why you should cook your own food?

Most quick food is so calorie dense. Going back to the kitchen is one of the best (and most affordable) weigh-management strategies.

# Week 0: Getting Started

Eat satisfying amounts of food that allow you to feel full and manage hunger while you’re losing weight.

Weight-loss programs have to be individualized to your likes and dislikes and to what is feasible and sustainable for you.

## Weight

Weigh yourself every day.

Weigh yourself on the same scale at the same time of the day.

- Morning
- Wear the same amount of clothing (or no clothing at all)

## BMI

Track your BMI daily.

## Waist

If you have extra weight around your middle, your chances of developing heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and high blood pressure are greater, even if your BMI indicates that your weight is healthy.

Wrap a tape measure around your belly across the top of your hipbones and below your belly button, exhale—no cheating by sucking in your gut—and hold the tape snug but not too tight.

A measurement of over 40 inches if you’re a man means you need to slim down.

Check your waist measurement every month.

## Daily Food Log

You need a starting point.

Keep a record of everything that you eat every day for one week:

- Types of food
- Portion sizes
- Approximate calories

You don’t need to track calories long-term. Just for now.

Once you understand where calories are in foods and in your diet, you will be better able to choose a nutritious balance of foods that are filling and satisfying without excess calories.

Merely writing everything down makes you think twice about some of your food choices.

Continue writing down what you eat for at least the next twelve weeks.

Record your meal or snack immediately after you eat.

Once you settle into your new way of eating, you may just do a food log during challenging times such as holidays.

# Satiety

Satiety is the feeling of fullness that comes with having eaten enough and not being hungry anymore.

Satiety works as a tool for managing your weight if you pay attention and respond appropriately to your body’s feelings of hunger and fullness.

Track your hunger and fullness levels before and after each meal and snack, noting which foods help you control hunger and feel satisfied with fewer calories.

### Get in touch with feelings of hunger and satiety

- Slow down at each meal and pay attention.
- For two days this week, ask yourself before each meal, “Am I hungry?”
- Rate your hunger on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being painfully ravenous and 10 being so full you couldn’t eat another bite.
- As you eat, periodically pause and ask yourself again, “Am I still hungry?
- If your rating has reached 5, it may be time to stop eating. Ratings in the middle of the scale indicate that you are no longer hungry nor are you overly full—you should be comfortable.
- If you are starting to feel full and satisfied, stop eating and wait for several minutes to give yourself time to recognize your body’s satiety signals.
- If you still feel hungry, continue eating while monitoring your feelings of hunger and fullness.
- If you are really out of touch with hunger and satiety, try a routine. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner on a regular schedule for several days and don’t snack. You should feel hungry before meals and satiated after meals. Use the rating scale before each meal and pay attention to how you feel. Remember these feelings and use them to guide your future eating.

## Exercise

150 minutes per week.

20 minutes per day.

Record physical activity in your daily journal.

Strength-building exercises at least twie a week in addition to walking and other activities can help tone muscles and improve your physical well-being.

## Setting Your Goals

Goals in three areas

- Weight loss
- Daily calories
- Daily steps

Guidelines for goal-setting

- Specific:  “I will walk for 30 minutes on at least three days of the week.”
- Measurable: “I will add 150 steps a day.”
- Attainable: Find the balance between a weight loss that is attainable and your dream weight. Divide big goals into smaller steps.
- Realistic: Personalize your goals to fit them into your lifestyle.
- Forgiving: Make your goals forgiving rather than all or nothing. Leave yourself wiggle room for occasionally missing the mark.
- Timely: Set goals that make sense or you now. Give yourself enough time to accomplish them.

Measure your activity in terms of number of daily steps.

Your ultimate activity goal is at least 10,000 steps a day (4-5 miles).

Work towards this goal by adding 1,000 daily steps (7-10 minutes; 0.5 mile) each week.

Add 150 steps each day until you reach your 1,000 extra steps.

## Next Actions

The purpose is not to count calories but instead to learn what your meals should look like at that calorie level.

Follow the menus exactly as writte or mix and match choices from other menus.

Calorie levels

- Breakfast: 400
- Lunch: 500
- Dinner: 500

### Process

- Write down the foods you eat at each meal and snack. You may want to circle the Volumetrics dishes that you like best.
- Rate your hunger and fullness at the beginning and end of each meal.
- Record your daily steps and other types of physical activity that you choose to include in your day.
- Step on the scale daily if you can, but not more than once a day and not less than once a week.
   - If your weight hits a plateau, check the amount you’re eating and your activity level to make sure you’re not getting more calories or moving less than you had planned. You may need to lower your daily calorie level and increase your steps.
- Keep track on the Personal Daily Record Form of the strategies you’ve used to reach your weekly goals.
- Include notes on your mood, emotions, or other factors that may have affected your eating.
