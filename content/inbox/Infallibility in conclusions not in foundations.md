# Infallibility in conclusions not in foundations

Ok there are certain truths.

But how they are applied to every day life is difficult.

There is an undeniable infallibility of human beings to predict things.

We still make mistakes.

The problem is not in the uncertainty of our foundations.

We can be certain of our foundations.

But what we can’t be certain about is in our conclusions (how we apply our beliefs_ideas_knowledge) because there are just so many variables and our minds can’t handle it, our computers even.
