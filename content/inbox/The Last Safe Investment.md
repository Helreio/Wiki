# The Last Safe Investment

# Introduction

**THE SAFE PLAN**

- SAFE = Self-Amplifying Financial Ecosystem
- Rather than relying on a single point of failure, such as the rate of asset growth in your portfolio, the SAFE plan outlines how to set up a system of interconnected parts that all work together to reliably produce financial and nonfinancial rewards.
- The SAFE plan helps you change the way you look at your career, your spending habits, your use of free time, your friends, and your financial situation to get them to work together, each amplifying the impact of the others, in much the same way that a strong team amplifies the impact of each individual.
- Priority: Make yourself happy and fulfilled now by finding the kind of work that you enjoy. The more you enjoy your work, the more able you’ll be to pursue it in older age, so you will probably be less inclined to stop.

Develop 3 disciplines

1. Spending systematically
2. Increasing your value to others
3. Increasing your happiness exchange rate

3 Assets that result from 3 disciplines

1. Adviser Equity
2. Tribe
3. Savings

---

**#1: SPEND SYSTEMATICALLY**

- Spend what you earn instead of saving it.
- Think about your life as a system of interconnected parts.
- Evaluate how any particular piece of spending improves every other context in your life aside from its original context.
- It transforms everyday consumption into investing.
- Why go to the trouble of learning how to be a wise investor if you have only a few thousand pesos each year to invest anyway?
- Instead of investing a few thousand pesos of savings per year, invest all of your money through spending them systematically.
- Measure the returns of your purchases in terms of their long-term benefits to you.
- Every time you spend your money, practice your investment thinking and leverage your spending to create the best possible future.

---

**#2: INCREASE YOUR VALUE TO OTHER PEOPLE**

- This is the heart of the SAFE plan
- Your value to other people is not intrinsic to you at all
- Your value = your behavior + other people’s desired outcomes
- Invest in your ability to detect other people’s desired outcomes and demonstrate behavior that is consistent with achieving those outcomes

Why Earning Potential

- Your earning potential is the most variable and predictable asset on Earth.
- Through investment in your professionalism, skills, relationships, network, and longevity, you have more control over future gains than with any other investment

What to do

1. Focus on the match between your behavior and the needs, desires, incentives, and objectives of those around you.
2. Use that match to identify the skills that are worth real dollars.
3. Invest in those skills.
4. Use the earnings you get to invest again to these or similarly profitable skills.

---

**#3: IMPROVE YOUR HAPPINESS EXCHANGE RATE**

- External Wealth -> Internal Wealth
- Your core drive to succeed financially depends on the idea that external wealth can be converted to internal wealth

Happiness Exchange Rate

- The measurement of this method of exchanging external wealth for internal wealth
- It determines how much money you need to spend in order to achieve the same level of happiness
- Involves developing the skill of being happy
- Involves paying close attention to the factors that contribute to your most (and least) rewarding experiences

Financial Enlightenment

- The ability to derive extreme pleasure from more and more mundane experiences.
- The SAFE plan calls for you to continuously evolve your ability to move toward Financial Enlightenment.

---

**TRUE WEALTH ASSETS**

True Wealth

- The ability to continually and automatically generate the external circumstances that foster the deepest experiences you seek combined with the capacity to derive internal fulfillment from those experiences.

True Wealth Assets

- All external things that work together to generate those circumstances on your behalf.
- It must continue to do its job if and when you decide to stop working.
- May require a modest amount of maintenance energy but their contribution to your True Wealth is not correlated with the amount of effort they require.
- The faster you build your True Wealth assets, the earlier you will have the option to slow down or even stop your earning activities.
- Financial components (savings and equity) are often not the most important ingredients.

3 Wealth Assets

1. Tribe
2. Adviser Equity
3. Savings

---

**#1: ADVISER EQUITY**

- The Contribution that you make in order to earn it is some form of interpersonal contribution such as advice or mentorship.
- Sweat Equity: Earned primarily through labor rather than investment of capital.
- Valued by the degree of impact you make on the future of the property or business and its current owners.
- Can be formal or informal (not governed by an explicit contract or agreement).
- It can change wildly in value depending on who holds it.
- Isn’t transferable.
- Worth more the more you spend it.
- Building this kind of support over decades is a more valid basis for true feelings of security than depending on the markets to continue to rise decade after decade.

How To Achieve

- Spend months and years honing your ability to be valuable to others in many forms.
- Arrange to have a share in the lifetime future success in the form of an adviser equity with younger people you will mentor.

Disclaimer

- It would be very unusual to create True Wealth solely through generosity and reciprocity.
- It would violate the spirit of informal equity to create the feeling of obligation among friends and mentees.

2 Kinds Of Adviser Equity

1. Formal - Can be converted directly to financial returns.
2. Informal - The ability to call in specific favours as you need them.

Formal + Informal = Reduction of cost of living (including during retirement) + Increased perception of luxury, security, and happiness

How To Increase Potential For ROI

- Increase your own generosity + effectiveness at helping others succeed.
- Better skill = More successful relationships

---

**#2: TRIBE**

- Most self-amplifying and high-leverage
- A community of your close friends, all of whom are close with one another, that coalesces around a specific set of values that are most important to you.
- The source of most of the nonmonetary resources you’ll need to create the circumstances of your True Wealth.
- A group having no fewer than about 15 members all of whom are close to one another.

How To Work

- All members of the tribe should care about one another so that single investments of time and attention can benefit many relationships.
- Anytime you strengthen your relationship with someone, you naturally strengthen your relationships with the people who care about that person most. If the people you care about most all care about one another most, each relationship strengthens all relationships.

Benefits

- Amplifies your ability to invest in True Wealth disciplines and assets
- Amplifies the positive impact of each discipline on your overall True Wealth
- Tribes tend to evolve their interpretations of and access to their values together over time.
- Tribes share. This has the potential to vastly amplify your quality of life, financial security, sense of luxury, and True Wealth.
- Reduces the cost of ownership of many of the emotional triggers for financial abundance and True Wealth.
- Reduces the downside risks in life.

**INVESTMENT**

- A commitment of resources, in light of your best, informed guess as to what the future will hold.
- Investment in the SAFE plan involves your best informed guess on the future of your earning potential.
- In the SAFE plan choices such as where you live, what skills you invest in, and whom you know become investments.

**THE SHARING ECONOMY**

The dream of comfortable retirement in a single-generation, single-family home is dead.

The sharing economy

Cohousing

It is actually more fun and inexpensive to live in a community that is well run and well functioning.

Using an asset is almost as good as owning it (and often better, when used with your friends), at a fraction of the cost and maintenance.

---

**INCLUSIONARY PRESTIGE**

Exclusionary Prestige

- Any type of prestige based on excluding others as in sole and private ownership.

2 Types of Exclusionary Prestige

1. Mainstream - Acquiring and owning the primary goods, accomplishments, and achievements promoted by the mainstream of any given culture. One person owning X means someone else cannot own the same X.
2. Countercultural - Hipster.

Inclusionary Prestige

- A type of prestige that benefits the people who seek it and everyone else as well.
- It is not based on how elite or cool someone is but on how much they contribute.
- Would-be contributors need people to contribute to so prestige based on contribution is inclusionary.

**6 INVALUABLE COMMUNITY SKILLS**

1. Contributive - An orientation toward contributing to, and making the biggest impact possible on, the lives of those around you.
2. Curating -
3. Accountable - Learning how to take feedback well, without getting defensive, and learning how to deliver feedback in a way that doesn’t trigger other people’s defensiveness.
4. Empathetic - Understanding why other people feel and think the things they do, even if you don’t agree with them.
5. Inner Work - Investing in therapy, coaches, and, most of all, face time with your community and beloveds is the best way to bring blind spots to the fore and address them.
6. Clean Communication Style - Expressing difficult emotions (anger, disappointment, jealousy, and sadness) in a nonviolent manner.

**TRUE WEALTH**

Infinite Resource

- Resources that are always immediately renewable .
- Examples: the capacity to give and receive love, acceptance, respect, trust, belonging, wonder, and awe.
- Once a person is alive and minimally subsisting, his capacity to give and receive love, acceptance, respect, trust, belonging, wonder, and awe is infinite.

Basic Economic Problem

- Mismatch between finite resources and infinite desires.

False Wealth

- The accumulation of finite resources in the hope of satisfying infinite desires.

True Wealth

- A person’s capacity to satisfy infinite values with infinite resources.
- A person’s capacity to satisfy finite values with sufficient resources.
- Self-awareness to know the difference.

2 False Beliefs

NEGATIVE RESULT

Attempting to satisfy infinite values while disregarding finite needs.

Continual struggle to make ends meet which impairs the capacity to receive, give, and savor the infinite values.

Satisfying infinite values with finite resources.

The need to take more and more extreme measures just to maintain a baseline of happiness.

Better Formula

1. Satisfy finite needs in sufficient degrees.
2. Satisfy infinite needs through infinite means.

How To Apply

- Develop self-awareness and maturity to distinguish between ones finite and infinite values and enact a life strategy that values the capacity for satisfying both categories.
- Stop being defined by the chase for ever more variety and quantity of finite values.
- Cultivate one or several infinite values which you are able to embody and spread beyond any limitation of finite resources.
- Successful cultivation of core infinite values over time creates a threshold of general life satisfaction after which there’s no sense of scarcity of finite value.
- Invest in your capacity to tap into the infinite resources within you, and within the people around you, so that you can finally begin to satisfy your infinite desires.
- Invest in your capacity to generate finite resources so that you can satisfy all the finite values you want and need in sufficient degree.
- Identify what “sufficient degree” means for you by being more self-aware. The more accurate your answer, the fewer financial resources you’ll waste in misguided attempts to satisfy infinite values with finite resources.
