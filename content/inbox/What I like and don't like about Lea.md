# What I like and don't like about Lea

What I don't like about her

- She dismisses intellectual conversations because she is intimidated.
- She needs to improve how she takes care of her physical health (but so as I)
- She's lazy
- She's not very intricate on household chores
- She isn't financially literate
- She has some emotional problems (but so do I)

What I like about her

- She likes to be with me
- She talks and listens at a proportionate amount of time
- She knows she can be toxic and she is mindful of it
- She journals
- She is connected with herself and does her best to do so
- She is loving to her siblings
- We have good chemistry
- She doesn't try to cover things up
- But she also doesn't overwhelm me with revelations
