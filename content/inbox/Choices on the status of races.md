# Choices on the status of races

Humans

Beasts

Plants

Spirits

Humans transform to beast-like form creating some of the mythological beings in Filipino mythology.

But some beasts are able to talk and create societies of their own.

While others cannot talk, still evolving.

Some beast-like mythological creatures will fall under this category.

A few plants too can talk and create societies of their own.

A few exhibit intelligence but not necessarily with language.

While most cannot.

Perhaps this can set you apart, try to develop your plant species in your fantasy world. Give them more voice.
