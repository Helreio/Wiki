## Summary

My tinnitus started to bother me immensely at the beginning of the year. It took all my attention, energy, and time almost the entire January. I was able to survive this tough challenge through the help of Lea, family, and my friends. My two trips to Antipolo: one to Pinto and another to the Ginhawa Well-being Retreat further helped me cope with my situation. This month, I also officially became a hearing-impaired PWD. Despite the tinnitus, I was relatively functional. While I didn’t work this month, I was able to work on some creative projects, perhaps owing to good sleep. I was even able to challenge myself and attend Clyne’s wedding!

## Good Events

- Had an encouraging video call with Rem.
- Returned to Pinto.
- Spent some time with Rem at Batangas.
- Joined my second Ginhawa Well-being Retreat. Made new friends: Brian, Michelle, Schelden. Sr. Schelden, in particular, was an exemplary find. She also suffers with tinnitus, but not chronic like mine. Knowing that she coped really encouraged me. She even gave me a doctor recommendation.
- My two trips to Antipolo really helped me get perspective on my situation.

## Setback and Challenges

- My tinnitus started to become really bothering on New Year’s eve. In the following weeks, it will take all my attention, energy, and time. I started researching and trying out different solutions to stop the sound. I would later learn that if the sound won’t stop after three months, there’s a big possibility that it will be a chronic issue (possibly a lifetime, if a future cure won’t be discovered).

## Personal Triumphs

- I reached out to Lea to get back with her and she accepted.
- Reached out to doctors through email, Facebook, and LinkedIn. One of them responded.
- I was able to continue my creative routine despite the tinnitus.
- I took responsibility of my tinnitus and explored options: tried our hearing aids, went to doctors in Manila
- Another note-worthy experience this month was applying for a PWD card. As of this time this year, I am a registered hearing impaired citizen of the Philippines. The universe is funny since I used to be a sign language interpreter for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired, and now I’m “technically” one of them!
- I was able to talk to Lea about my suicidal thoughts.
- Reached out to family members who went through tinnitus (Ate Donette)
- Tracked my tinnitus.
- First time to ride the bus to Manila with PWD discount.
- Went to a wake of a young 19-year-old girl who committed suicide. I purposefully went to be reminded of my resolve to not take my life.
- I attended Clyne’s wedding and saw JW relatives and past friends after a long time.

## Insights and Lessons

- The most important lesson I think I learned regarding my tinnitus situation this month was that there is little I can do in decreasing the level of the sound but there’s a lot I can do in terms of my emotional response to it. I started taking care of my health more, sleeping better, going to Nature more often, and meditating longer.
