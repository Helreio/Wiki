# Humans act

“Humans act” is an a priori statement, which is the foundation of the inductive reasoning behind [[praxeology]]. It is a statement that describes an undeniable fact. A rejection of this statement is itself an [[thoughts/action]], therefore, proving the truthfulness of the statement.

This statement is where [[Human Action: A Treatise on Economics - Mises]] starts its dicussion of [[Economics]] in the lens of [[austrian economics]].

However, the statement can be used as a [[Tautology]] for explorations outside economics. For example, it is where I started with my discussion on the necessity for a [[thoughts/life management system]].
