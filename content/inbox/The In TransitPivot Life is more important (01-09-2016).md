# The In Transit/Pivot Life is more important (01-09-2016)

Owning a land is something I’m thinking about now. It is inspiring. But it is a big commitment, something that might not be there in the future. It could change. So I shouldn’t be so in-love with it.

My destination has to be an IN TRANSIT destination. Something that can be pivoted.

I am young and am always changing.

I like variety because I am a multipotentialite.
