# Scholar + Writing Career Design

**PURPOSE**

**Central**

To live a mindful, playful, and peaceful life that is kind to the earth, to all sentient beings, to the people who inhabit the planet, and most especially, to the Self.

**Level 1 - Study (Consciousness)**

- To research answers to my questions.
- To solidify my personal philosophy and beliefs.
- To align my life towards what I am learning.

**Level 2 - Expression**

- To express my personal philosophy and beliefs.
- To be seen.
- To have a “career” to show other people.

**Level 3 - Community**

- To be connected with a community (scenius of like-minded individuals.

**Level 4 - Influence**

- To influence a significant number of people to see the world through my eyes.
- To use my platform to as an authentic representation of my lifestyle for it to be an example that people can follow.
- To contribute in healing the world.
- To publish books and other make other creative projects towards this end.

It is not a business or a “career” that I ultimately want to build. At the heart of my desire to write is to solidify my consciousness about what’s happening around me, to create a personal philosophy (a personal religion) that I can follow to address the issues happening around me and to align my way of living with what I am learning so that I become part of the solution not the problem. There might be no obvious injustices but the injustices are subtle. What I ultimately want to see is a nonviolent society, community, world.

All the external components of a writing career (getting published, etc.) are part of the design but they are at level 4 and are far from the heart of what I want to do.

**PRINCIPLES**

*(Principles define the parameters of action and the criteria for excellence of conduct. Ask: What behavior might undermine what I’m doing? How can I prevent it?)*

**Be grateful.** I am required to be happy and grateful when I have at least one person listening to what I have to say.

**Always be playful.** I am required to make this journey artistic, playful, interesting, and exciting all the time. If a project does not excite me, I won’t do it.

**Be who you are.** Stop being someone you are not.

**Mission first (service + art), business second.** I am required to focus on my mission, my interests, and my art. I will write what I want to write. I will create what I want to and I know needs to exist. My writing career doesn’t have to be the source of my income. I have freelance writing, bread labor (homesteading), and future business projects to fund my already frugal lifestyle.

**Start small.** No need to start with the big projects like a book or a nonprofit organization that will give wheels to my writing. I will start with my life, my story, my desire to change my life.

**Focus on one project at a time.** Try as much as you can to dedicate your entire time and effort for a creative project to give it enough chance to grow and to give yourself enough space to go with the flow when doing the project.

**Balance time between creating, marketing, and connecting.** Creating fulfills my level 1 purpose (researching and writing), marketing my work fulfills my level 2 (being seen) and level 4 (influencing) purposes. And connecting with readers and peers fulfills my level 4 purpose (community). I need to make sure that I spend enough time to each areas.

**Think longterm.** Don’t get to antsy and impatient. Writing is a longterm lifetime practice. As long as you honor it, give it space, and enough time to grow, you will enjoy the journey.

**The journey is the reward.** Keep practicing. Milestones are just milestones. The practice, the doing, the creating - that is the true joy.

**VISION/OUTCOME**

*(Vision provides the actual blueprint of the final result. This is the WHAT of your WHY. You must have a clear picture in your mind of what success would look, sound, and feel like. What will this project or situation really be like when it successfully appears in the world? Focus on this clear picture and your mind will take you there.)*

- Frequency: once a week? a month? every 2 or 3 months?
- Mini guides?

List the writers writing on the same subjects you are interested in.

**ORGANIZE**

Identify

- Components
- Subcomponents
- Sequences of events
- Priorities

Ask

- What are the things that must occur to create the final result?
- In what order must they occur?
- What is the most important element to ensure the success of the project?

***Career Design***

**Platform setup**

Microblogging Platform

- Select a microblogging platform to use consistently.
- Study how to use it well.

Options

- Facebook
- Tumblr

**Website**

- Update About Page
- Set up an updateable belief manifesto
- Set up reading list
- Set up newsletter to be blog post rss
- Send an email to each subscriber saying thanks and telling them you’re doing a different thing this 2017. Give them an option to subscribe. Only those who subscribe again will be part of the new newsletter list. Those who don’e either are uninterested or want to receive the same things I’m sending in the past. I’m still writing about life but I’m combining it with my passion for scholarship.

**Daily Practice**

To do:

1. Study a particular topic through a book etc.
2. Microblog with a post that is made up of:
- A research finding or thought
- A personal reflection
- A practical “how to” application
1. Publish the blog post.
2. Send it as a newsletter.
3. Share the blog post on Facebook.
4. Reach out to at least one member of your community (audience, peers, or influencers).

This will be a daily practice. If busy then it won’t be done. But it has to be as daily as possible.
