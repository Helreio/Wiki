# Exercises in Excavating the Future

1. Think about your earliest memories when you did just what you wanted to do. They don’t need to be productive activities. No matter how seemingly unimportant, let your mind revisit your original inclinations and desires.

**Play.** All I did was play. I and Bernice were creative in our approach to play. We used toys but we created our own stories. Whether we used snails, action figures, or paper-cut characters, we created stories, little worlds around them. These were the happiest days of my life. I think I transferred that desire to create made up worlds into drawing. I followed anime and cartoons and sort of took inspiration from them.

2. Using the same attention to sensory detail, list some things you loved doing as a toddler, as a child, as a teenager, and as a young adult.

Story about my past life and the life I want to live

Note

My creativity is not simply skill-based. I always wanted to tell a story.

**I don’t know which came first: medium, influence, or story. I guess ::story was always there. The medium facilitated or unleashed the story and the influence helped shape the story.::**

3. Pick out the five most powerful memories from the above lists
1. Creating worlds out of my action figures - basketball innovated, lego, mini cities, anime episodes.
2. Ilaya - really creating an amazing story plan.
3. Plays at school - creating imagined people, storylines, and worlds.
4. My relationship with Jehovah - reading, reflecting, praying, dedication to the cause.
5. Creating [VincentImbat.Com](http://vincentimbat.com/) - life after depression, recovery from JWs

Apply the following questions to each of your five memories:

What part of this experience gave you pleasure?

What circumstances allowed you to concentrate?

Was there anything in the environment or the social setting that contributed to the joy or the heightened clarity?

Was the action meant to benefit anyone else, like a gift? Was it a collaboration? Was it highly private?

Was it intended to impress, rile, or protect someone?

Was your mind completely involved in the action or were you spurred on by the idea of what the finished product could do? Did this project have a purpose outside the action itself?

What belief did this action express?

ACTIVITY #1

Creating worlds out of my action figures - basketball innovated, lego, mini cities, anime episodes.

What part of this experience gave you pleasure?

Thinking and coming up with the next part of the story.

What circumstances allowed you to concentrate?

I was by myself.

There were moments when I was playing with others but even in these circumstances I had a say on what will happen next in the stories.

**So ::autonomy and being left alone really provided me with the energy to create and have pleasure from the process.::**

Was there anything in the environment or the social setting that contributed to the joy or the heightened clarity?

Nothing in particular other than I was by myself and am allowed to be by myself.

Was the action meant to benefit anyone else, like a gift? Was it a collaboration? Was it highly private?

It was all for my own pleasure.

Was it intended to impress, rile, or protect someone?

No.

Was your mind completely involved in the action or were you spurred on by the idea of what the finished product could do? Did this project have a purpose outside the action itself?

Yes. **I was completely involved in the action. I was not thinking about any finished product. The activity does not have a purpose outside the action itself.**

What belief did this action express?

None. Other than play.

ACTIVITY #2

Ilaya - really creating an amazing story plan.

What part of this experience gave you pleasure?

Thinking and designing the storyline.

Drawing and seeing the product unleash.

What circumstances allowed you to concentrate?

Being by myself.

Was there anything in the environment or the social setting that contributed to the joy or the heightened clarity?

Nothing in particular other than I was by myself and am allowed to be by myself.

Was the action meant to benefit anyone else, like a gift? Was it a collaboration? Was it highly private?

**It was private but I think I was influenced because my buddy Roland was also drawing and creating stories.**

Was it intended to impress, rile, or protect someone?

There is outside influence and maybe this project had an element of wanting to show something to Roland or my friends. But it was not yet so strong.

Was your mind completely involved in the action or were you spurred on by the idea of what the finished product could do? Did this project have a purpose outside the action itself?

I was in the action of drawing. But I remember that there were some comics I made before that I really just want to see finished. **The drawings were not that good. I was making my drawings fast because I wanted to see how the story will end.**

What belief did this action express?

I didn’t have strong beliefs at this point. But I do have the feeling (or belief) that I can draw and that I like to do it and that I can create something beautiful.

ACTIVITY #3

Plays at school - creating imagined people, storylines, and worlds.

What part of this experience gave you pleasure?

Thinking and designing the storyline.

Directing the play.

Watching as the play unravels.

Seeing the success of the play and getting praises.

What circumstances allowed you to concentrate?

I was alone.

Was there anything in the environment or the social setting that contributed to the joy or the heightened clarity?

Being with friends.

Being the leader.

Having the authority to direct the play.

Was the action meant to benefit anyone else, like a gift? Was it a collaboration? Was it highly private?

The plays were meant to benefit everyone in the group. It was a collaboration but much of the work starts inside my head and therefore 50% of the job was highly private.

Was it intended to impress, rile, or protect someone?

I was in a very competitive environment at that time. So part of the process was really impressing the spectators - my teacher who was giving the grade and my classmates whose admiration to me will grow.

But during the most private moments of the project, everything was for me. No one else.

Was your mind completely involved in the action or were you spurred on by the idea of what the finished product could do? Did this project have a purpose outside the action itself?

Doing the work itself from writing and directing and playing I am both in the moment and thinking of the product of all my efforts. The purpose is to get a high grade and to wow the spectators.

What belief did this action express?

No strong belief in particular. Just a spirit of competition and belief in my ability to create a beautiful play that will wow others.

ACTIVITY #4

My relationship with Jehovah - reading, reflecting, praying, dedication to the cause.

What part of this experience gave you pleasure?

Having this deep meaning and understanding and sense of purpose attached to life and everything that I do.

Those moments when I was by myself, studying, and having this close prayers with Jehovah.

Then feeling compelled to do my part in the outside world.

But these moments by myself were really what gave me much pleasure.

What circumstances allowed you to concentrate?

I was alone.

I had a room and personal space.

Was there anything in the environment or the social setting that contributed to the joy or the heightened clarity?

I was alone and people didn’t bother me.

It was quiet around.

**I was surrounded by nature.**

**This I think is the environment where I thrive best.**

Was the action meant to benefit anyone else, like a gift? Was it a collaboration? Was it highly private?

Was it intended to impress, rile, or protect someone?

In this matter it was very private and I found pleasure by doing things privately and knowing things and reading and learning. But all the things I did in the name of Jehovah were obviously for him, for this invisible persona, for this cause. It was not meant to impress but to do a martyrdom of service renouncing myself, doing the will even if I will be destroyed.

So the element of the Other was present.

Was your mind completely involved in the action or were you spurred on by the idea of what the finished product could do? Did this project have a purpose outside the action itself?

The private aspect of religious work - studying, praying, and meditating - these are all pleasurable as is.

But there are outside-oriented parts of the work that involves being spurred by a finished product like when I was creating a system for a territory or during the times when I was preparing for talks and lesson plans for my Bible students.

**What belief did this action express?**

Belief on the martyrdom of Jesus. Of self-sacrifice. Of giving everything even one’s own life for the sake of a cause.

ACTIVITY #5

Creating [VincentImbat.Com](http://vincentimbat.com/) - life after depression, recovery from JWs

What part of this experience gave you pleasure?

Learning something new

Being introduced to colorful lives that challenge the status quo

Designing the project

Getting my hands dirty with creating the website

What circumstances allowed you to concentrate?

Alone time

Personal space

Lots of free time

Not worrying about money, etc.

Was there anything in the environment or the social setting that contributed to the joy or the heightened clarity?

Nothing in particular other than the things I mentioned above.

Breaks where I go ride my bike. These are the times when great ideas begin to visit me.

Was the action meant to benefit anyone else, like a gift? Was it a collaboration? Was it highly private?

Was it intended to impress, rile, or protect someone?

The action was not meant to benefit anyone else other than my intended audience I guess. But this issue was always coming up because I just wanted the project to be something deeply for myself but the issue of an audience keeps on coming out either from mentors or from my own conscience.

It wasn’t a collaboration. It was highly private. It was not primarily intended to impress but the project has to impress people in some way since it was a website - a brand of myself.

Was your mind completely involved in the action or were you spurred on by the idea of what the finished product could do? Did this project have a purpose outside the action itself?

I was involved in the action but I guess I was more spurred to see the finished product. The platform was both an expression of my art and an attempt to do business. I wanted to earn money fast doing blogging. At the same time I wanted to have an artistic brand and representation in the web. So the product had strong power over me.

But creating and thinking and designing - important parts of the project - were pleasurable by themselves.

What belief did this action express?

The belief on unconventional living.

The belief on telling my story.

The belief on putting myself at the middle of my life - instead of God or the JW cause.

Spiritual beliefs

Eastern philosophy

4. List your five most essential beliefs.
1. **Nonduality.** Everything is one and interconnected. No to competition, yes to cooperation and compassion.
2. **Paradox and Mediation.** Saying yes to everything, being at the middle - is the best solution to the pursuit of self-knowledge. Stay away from fundamentalism.
3. **Inner Work.** Our inner self should be the source of outer work and social change. Know yourself and live an undivided life.
4. **Mindfulness**. being in the present moment saves lives and makes a richer experience. Choose a goal that involves a process that feels good. The journey is the reward. Do things with the quality of action - mindfully - without being attached to the results.
5. **Minimalism.** Time doing things that make you come alive is more important than money. Therefore, living with less which allows you to have more time to do whatever you want when you want is true success.
6. **Freedom.** You are the source of your own truth. No one should tell you how to live other than yourself.

Now look for times or events in your life when you were best able to put these beliefs into action.

**Memory connected to belief 1**

I can’t seem to think of a time when I concretely put this belief into action. I guess I am still living in dualism.

Or maybe my sense of nonduality is connected with my sense of paradox and mediation - that of being averse from beliefs that are too strong and fundamentalistic, that don’t allow for freedom and creativity to flourish.

In that sense then my disassociation with my religion and political views counts as expression of my belief in nonduality.

**Memory connected to belief 2**

Same as above.

**Memory connected to belief 3**

This belief spurred me to put my story at the middle of [VincentImbat.Com](http://vincentimbat.com/) and to really take care of myself and use my story of recovery as my differentiator.

**Memory connected to belief 4**

I am trying to practice mindfulness with everything I do every day and am trying to bring value to every single day, to make it different that yesterday and to saver everything that life and existence has to offer.

I try to stop and just be.

Also I take a slow-burn approach to my business and creative ideas

**Memory connected to belief 5**

I chose to live a simple life.

I chose to live freelance and am intending to continue living this kind of life.

**Memory connected to belief 6**

I left the JW religion and embark into a journey of self-actualization and freedom.

**Note**

Much of the beliefs I now adhere to are new ones (like 3-5 years old). This is because of the depression I went through that forced me to recreate my life from the ground up.

At the same time, my acquisition of these beliefs will never be possible if I didn’t went through all the things I went through.

**Perhaps the existence of these beliefs point to to the work I should be doing in the world.**

5. Compare the memories in exercise one with these memories.

Are there any overlapping memories?

The creation of [VincentImbat.Com](http://vincentimbat.com/) is the only memory that overlapped.

**But this belief in mindfulness and non-attachment is quite connected with the concept of play that has inspired me for so long during the best years of my creative years - my childhood.**

Do you see any contradictions between your beliefs and what ignites you to inspired and joyful action?

No.

Can you spot any false beliefs that you feel you have difficulty living up to or that you cling to for some reason?

No.
