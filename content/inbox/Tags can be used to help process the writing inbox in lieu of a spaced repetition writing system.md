# Tags can be used to help process the writing inbox in lieu of a spaced repetition writing system

Although I have implemented a [[Spaced repetition writing system]] in Craft, I am unable to use it consistently. Why? Because most days, I simply use interest to dictate what I pay attention to and think about. There is resistance for me to use the spaced repetition writing system because it forces me to think about subjects that don't necessarily interest me for a given day. This I think is the weakness of enforced spaced repetition systems.

Spaced repetition happens anyway when we go back to previous interests, which we ultimately do.

That said, I could still use the spaced repetition writing system on days when I donâ€™t have a particular interest to explore or when I need randomnes to break the monotony. Also, the spaced repetition writing system seems to be a more efficient way to assure that the inbox is processed at a better rate than when I just rely on interest.
