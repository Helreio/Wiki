# Smart Sync Workshop: How to Automatically Save Your Reading Highlights

The Capture Habit

3 kinds of information

1. Information that is pushed to you
2. Information that you pull toward you
3. Information that you create

Move from 1 to 2 for peace of mind.

When you curate things, you escape the reactivity loop.

Reactivity Loop

- Going somewhere to react to stuff.

Instead of reading a new book, look back at your highlights and see what you can do with them.

Less is more. Be very selective of what you consume.
