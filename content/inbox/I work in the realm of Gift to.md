# I work in the realm of Gift to

- Pursue what my heart is telling me.
- To serve others unconditionallt with my whole self and with no compromising of my passions.

I work in the realm of Sustenance to

- Make the little money I need.
- Provide for my other materialm needs moneylessly.

I work in the realm of Health to

- Heal the mind and body I was given.
- To maintain the mind and body I was given.
- And to improve the mind and body I was given.

I am a Renaissance man, earning enough money, living a lifestyle that is resilient, and doing what he loves to do with the pure intention of the artist.
