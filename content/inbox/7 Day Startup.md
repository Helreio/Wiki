# 7 Day Startup

# 14 Business Rules to Live By

**1. Test every assumption**

- Why does everyone in your industry do things a certain way?
- What do your customers really like about your service?
- Why aren’t people buying your product?
- Why are they buying your product?
- Are people using your product?
- How are they using it?
- Why do they love it?
- What do they tell people when they refer you?
- Are certain parts of your product necessary?
- Do you need an office?
- Do you need a business card?
- Do you need a logo?

Similar to the examples above, there may be assumptions in your industry that have prevented people from doing certain things. There’s a very good chance they haven’t been tested recently. One small discovery might be enough to kickstart a whole new business or product.

**2. Solve problems as they arise**

- Getting a flawless credit card payment process setup before they have customers.
- Optimizing their website before they have traffic.
- Hiring staff before they have work for them.
- Investing in the best systems before they have enough work to warrant it.

Normally these decisions stem from believing that when you have a problem, you won’t be able to resolve it quickly. Yet this assumption is often wrong.

There’s a good chance that if you are a new business, you only have one problem: not enough customers. That’s where you should be spending your time.

**3. Do what you say you will do.**

**4. Benchmark against the best**.

Once you have a clear path, prioritize quality.

Any time you feel yourself wondering if what you are doing is good enough, compare it to the best:

- Don’t ask your friends to pick between three logos. Instead, compare them all to Apple. If it’s nowhere near as good, try again.
- If you write a blog post, compare it to one on [KISSmetrics.com](http://KISSmetrics.com) [55](evernote-html-snippet:///part0055_split_001.html#footnote-91375-55). If it’s not as good, rewrite it.
- If you launch a website, compare it to [bench.com](http://bench.co) [56](evernote-html-snippet:///part0055_split_001.html#footnote-91375-56) or [simple.com](http://simple.com) [57](evernote-html-snippet:///part0055_split_001.html#footnote-91375-57). If it’s nowhere near as good, then you can do better.

It’s often asking a lot for a small business to reach the levels of an established leader. You will be compared to leaders, and if you don’t measure up, then people will notice. By comparing yourself to the best, you set higher expectations for yourself, and you will be better for it.

**5. Learn from others and yourself.**

- Solve a problem by either:
- Implementing a quick decision and learning from data.
- Looking at what other companies have done before.

**6. Outlearn your competition.**

Learn by Building, Measuring, and Learning.

**7. Always consider how your business would look without you.**

**8. Look for sources of momentum.**

Keep an eye on what is working and do more of it.

**9. Manage motivation.**

If you are struggling with motivation:

- [ ] join a forum
- [ ] start a mastermind group
- [ ] find a cofounder
- [ ] hire people to do the hard work and get back to doing what you’re good at.

**10. Cull difficult customers.**

**11. Focus on retention.**

You need to do everything to keep your customers and the data you get churning customers is priceless.

Make sure you are delivering constant value to your existing customers.

Subject: Did we do something wrong?

Body: Hey [first name]. I noticed you cancelled your subscription, did we do something wrong?

Deal with the reason.

**12. Avoid short-term thinking.**

Short-term projects or launches don’t build an asset.

Launching a whole bunch of related services will make your business complicated.

Building a startup takes time.

Work on your patience.

- Use a simple spreadsheet that predicts growth 12 months in advance. Seeing those numbers can be motivating and act as a good reminder that it will be worth waiting around.
- Have an “abundance go to” saying. The one I used to tell myself early on was: “There are 70,000,000 WordPress websites. Surely there are 500 of them who will pay $69/month to make sure they don’t have to worry about their site.” When you put it like that, it seems crazy to do anything other than continue focusing on building your business. This help with motivation, but it also is a reminder that you don’t need to chase other shiny objects.
- Think in the long term about what asset you are building as a result of actions you complete today. Getting carried away onshort-term projects will kill any chance of momentum and hurt growth.

**13. Focus on product.**

Anything you can do that improves the product or improves the customer experience will be a sound investment.

If you are feeling overwhelmed with all of the things you need to do, just focus on how to make your product slightly better.

This is the best way to spend your time.

**14. Love your work.**

# Refine Your Business Model

Take care of customers after launch day.

See if they are referring.

Listen to feedback so you know how to grow your business.

After getting your first customers, establish a self-sufficient business model.

Think about business model last because you should let the customers dictate what the business model would be.

Every decision you make about how you design your business and what work to take on will impact its ability to grow.

Plot all the mistakes you did in the past so you won’t make them again.

**5 Criteria for Building a Business with Growth in its DNA**

*1. Profit Margin*

You have to be making more than it costs you to servicing that customer.

50% revenue

50% costs

If it costs $50/month to service a customer, I will charge $100/month.

*2. Large Market*

Enough potential to have a continually growing business.

*3. Asset Building*

website

recurring clients

What are your working on today that will make you indestructible tomorrow?

*4. Simple Business Model*

Simple product

Simple value proposition

*5. Recurring or Predictable Revenue*

Simple: Have more customers signing up that leaving.

# The 7 Day Startup - Day 7

**Day 7 - Launch**

Put up your website with payment button.

Include as many options to contact you as possible.

You want to talk to customers and potential customers as much as possible from day one onwards.

Live chat.

Email.

Physical address.

Phone number.

Social media profiles.

Email your email list and ask them so sign up if they’re interested.

Post update on social networks, forums and groups.

Update your forum signatures with a specific call to action.

Tell friends and press contacts to tell the news.

Thank people who have helped you get to the launch day.

Don’t stress!

It takes 1,000 days to build a business.

Execute marketing plan.

# The 7 Day Startup - Day 6

**Day 6 - Set Targets**

Launch a startup quickly to get data from real customers.

This will help you determine if the business is having an impact.

The One Metric That Matter (OMTM) in different stages of your business.

During launch focus on:

- [ ] the number of people who sign up and pay you.

Set a reasonable target that takes into consideration your reach and your marketing efforts and price point.

Don’t get aggressive targets in business. It is potentially demotivating.

Shoot for a few customers early on and set a realistic monthly growth rate from there.

**Example**

WP Curve

10 customers in the first month.

$500 in MRR

From there, grow at 10% per month for at leat the first 6 months.

Your primary goal should be to get to a point where you’re paying yourself a reasonable wage as early as possible.

MRR

For recurring businesses, your OMTM is getting more people to sign up than those leaving.

**General Principles for setting your OMTM**

- Make it a financial metric not vanity metric like (website visits or Facebook likes).
- Pay particular attention to who is signing up. Your friends are different from the general public.
- Set a goal in the first month and revisit it each month.
- The OMTM will change over time. Don’t measure anything that will no longer matter to your business.

How do you know if you are into something or when you should give up?

Use your own judgement.

Focus on what your paying customers are saying and how many people continue to pay you.

**Day 6 Task**

Create a spreadsheet that covers the first few months in business, the number of signups, revenue, estimated costs, and monthly growth.

# The 7 Day Startup - Day 5

**Day 5 - 10 Ways to Market Your Business**

Don’t plan the first 30 days.

Give yourself enough activities for that first month of business to try a bunch of strategies.

Figure out what works for you and what doesn’t.

Make sure you get your product in front of enough qualified buyers.

This will help you learn what works for you and what to do next.

**1. Create content on your site.**

- Content marketing is not the fastest way to get people, but it’s cheap, fun, and it helps people.
- Publish your content on higher traffic sites.
- Create in-depth content based around the customer problems that your business solves.
- Make content as actionable and useful to your target audience as possible.
- It can’t be boring. Don’t just create content around your area of expertise. Create anything that is interesting to your potential customers.
- Optimise your site for email opt-ins so you can get people back to your site by sending emails.
- Don’t worry about SEO. Focus predominantly on creating useful content.
- Try a bunch of content mediums and look for where you get traction (on site written content, infographics, videos, podcasts, ebooks, or white papers, etc.)
- Make sure you know what sort of content produces the outcomes you want.
- In the early days, do more offsite work like podcast interviews and guest posts to put yourself in front of new audiences.
- You can also create content on your own site for long-term momentum.

**2. Start sending emails.**

Build an email list before you launch then grow the list after.

Tips to build an email list

- Writing emails to his friends.
- Set landing pages. The pre-launch list is a good list to start.
- Send only high quality relevant information.
- Give away something relevant and valuable to people to get them onto the list.
- Create great content on your site and provide giveaways (lead magnets) that are related to the content.
- Keep all emails personal and encourage people to reply to the emails. This is an opportunity to help people and get feedback lightning fast.
- Mailchimp -> Infusionsoft

**3. Podcasting.**

Do podcasting to network with amazing entrepreneurs.

When you have your own podcast, you will get invitation to appear on other ones.

**4. Forums and online groups.**

Build networks and find customers.

**5. Guest blogging.**

Be honest and upfront while constructing a genuinely real and interesting post.

Know your ideal customers extremely well.

Get your message to the right people.

2. Email opt-in freebies.
3. Webinar.
4. Makes sales.

**8. Presenting**

In person event

**9. Doing free work**

Derek Murphy - ebook covers

Early on, your main challenge will be getting people to use your product or service. If you can do that then you’ll start learning a lot about what you need to do to perfect it. You’ll also gather testimonials and referrals which will help drive future growth.

Doing free work is to help spread the word. This is not a validation exercise. Free users are not the same as paying customers.

**10. Media coverage**

Must also be targeted.

Pull a list of journalists.

Chase entrepreneur friends who have been featured.

Look for stories in everything that you do.

Maintain good relationships with journalists and influencers.

**How to be successful in marketing**

Do it in a way that utilises your unique strengths.

Test a bunch of options and double down on what is working well.

**Day 5 Task**

Build a list of what marketing strategies you are going to choose.

Put up a plan for the first week or two of your launch.

# The 7 Day Startup - Day 4

**Day 4 - Build a Website in One Day for Under $100**

**2 Purposes of the Landing Page**

1. To start communicating with customers and learning how they respond.
2. To begin to build what will ultimately sell your product.

**3 approaches**

1. Create a site designed to capture email addresses before you ultimately launch in four days’ time.
2. Create a site that “pre-sells” your product before you launch it.
3. Create the actual sales page that you’ll use on launch day.

**A suggested basic marketing funnel**

1. Customer visits your website and “opts in” by handing over their email address in return for a freebie that helps solve a problem they have.
2. Over time you send them useful information about that problem.
3. When they are ready to buy, they visit your payment page and purchase.

**3 things you need**

1. A page that collects email addresses
2. A system you can use to email people (Infusionsoft, MailChimp, Getdrip)
3. A page where you can sell your product or service

**3 things that will help you out**

1. Your copy is extremely important - Dan Maxwell’s copywriting checklist.
2. When you are selling online, images make a huge difference (professionally designed theme + images)
3. Set up Google Analystics. Install YOAST Google Analytics plugin in Wordpress to hook it up. Setup conversion goals for your purchase or email option.

As you get more ideas, add them to your site and start paying attention to what feedback you get.

You can also keep an eye on analytics and, ideally, what conversions you are getting on that landing page.

- Extend a related word.
- Outsource it.

**A framework for choosing an acceptable business name**

2. Is it simple? - 12 characters or less.
3. Is it easy to say out loud?
4. Do you like it?
5. Does it make sense for your idea?
6. Broader is better.

**Day 3 Task**

- Come up with a bunch of potential business names and evaluate them against the criteria above.
- Choose whichever one makes the most sense to you and run with it.
- Grab the best domain you can for that name.

# The 7 Day Startup - Day 2

**Day 2 - WTF is an MVP?**

Rather than spending six months creating a product or service, do only the smallest amount of work required to truly test it.

The common MVP mistake is overemphasising the “minimum” and underemphasising the “viable."

Once you have your product or service idea, it’s time to think about what you can launch within one week that represents your final vision for your product or service as closely as possible. That is from the customer’s point of view. The ugly “behind the scenes” view does not matter right now.

The key is to forget about automation and figure out what you can do manually.

An MVP in a service business isn’t too hard, but with software or physical products it becomes a bit trickier. The same principles apply, though. You need to think about how you can mimic the customer experience as much as possible, as quickly as possible.

**What will your MVP look like?**

- How can you perform a service or offer a product to real customers?
- How will you get them to pay you after seven days?
- How close will your MVP be to the final version of your product?
- What can you do manually? (hint: probably everything)
- What can you do yourself instead of delegating?
- How can you make your offer as real as possible for the end customer?

Your product or service will need to be at a point where you can offer it at the end of the week. This won’t be easy. It will be fun. It will also force you to be creative and to put something in the hands of your customers and to ask them for money.

**Day 2 Task**

- Write down exactly what you will launch on Day 7.
- What will your customers get, what is included, and what is excluded?
- If necessary, write down what is automated and what will be done manually in the short term.

# The 7 Day Startup - Day 1

Day 1 - The 9 Elements of a Good Bootstrapped Idea

**5 things that matter in making a successful business**

- Idea
- Execution
- A founder’s ability to get customers (to hustle)
- Timing
- Luck

Spend just one day on your idea.

You can always change it once you start learning from real customer data.

**9 Elements of a Good Bootstrapped Idea**

1. Enjoyable daily tasks

Maintaining a blog

Writing

Yeah. A a little.

5. An asset you can sell

::- It’s your job as a startup founder to build assets.::

- [ ] Focusing on short-term launches or projects won’t build assets. ::Assets are built over time by ignoring short-term distractions in favour of a bigger, long-term vision.::

::- Think about what assets your idea will result in.::

::- If you work on this idea for 5 years, what will you have in the end?::

::Example of assets:::

Includes team and customers.

::6. Large market potential::

- [ ] You have to serve large markets.
- [ ] Consistent profit growth.

::- Are you building something for a small group of people or can it grow into a large market?::

Large market.

How do I know if it is a large market?

::7. Tap into pain or pleasure differentiators::

- [ ] USP or differentiators are not enough
- [ ] All that matters is what your customers care about.

::- What will your customers really care about?::

::- Does your idea tap into a deep pain or pleasure point for them? Or is it just a cool idea?::

::8. Unique lead generation advantage::

- [ ] The best bootstrapped businesses have ways of generating leads that tap into a key differentiator in the business or the founder.
- [ ] How are you going to generate leads for your business?
- [ ] What will make you, and your company, unique?

I don’t have this.

I don’t know how to make one but definitely I’m on zero level on this.

9. Ability to launch quickly
- [ ] Choose an idea that you can launch and modify quickly. Then when you start getting real data from paying customers, you can innovate and get the product just right.

**Is your idea a good idea?**

- ::Choose a business idea that fits the 9 elements well and you are ready to move on.::
- ::You can tweak the idea later, but some of these fundamentals will be hard issues to solve later on.::
- ::It’s important that the potential is there from the start.::
- ::Create something valuable for your customers that is a long-term asset.::
- ::Launch something that gives you purpose, creates something original in the world, and builds long-term value.::
- ::As an entrepreneur, you need something that people want to pay for, with their money or attention.::
- ::Solve problems where people are already paying for solutions.::

**Day One Tasks**

- ::Brainstorm a bunch of ideas and evaluate them against the checklist.::
- ::Choose the idea that stands out as being the best option for you.::

It’s clear that I want to launch a blog.

But a blog is just a platform to market the business.

What is the business?

That is what you will launch in 7 days.

It’s your product/service.

- What is the pain or pleasure that you will attempt to solve? - publishing a book, getting your work out there, etc.
- What will your customers care about? - being famous, making sales, getting a good idea out there.
