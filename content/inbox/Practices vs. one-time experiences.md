# Practices vs. one-time experiences

Everything is a new experience. [[thoughts/craig mod]] said that the only real walking is re-walking, the only real reading is re-reading. It is beautiful, but not necessarily true. It sounds poetic, but if I put it under scrutiny, I don't know what I'll get from it exactly. Perhaps what he was saying is that doing things as a practice or a habit transforms transitory, one-time events, into life-long and long-term pursuits. But is there possibly any good that can be taken from short-term, one-off experiences? Arenâ€™t these more precious by the fact that they will never happen again? They can be easily distinguished from those events that happen all the time.

Nonetheless, I also see the importance of emphasizing that habitual things that happen all the time need to have a better image as they can be overlooked most of the time.
