# Thought Leaders Practice - How to develop ideas

Developing your ideas

Your quality of thinking must earn you the right to identify yourself as an expert because of the quality of thought that is relevant, thorough, elegant and unique.

Treat your ideas as continual works in progress.

Target messages with these outcomes

Relevant - meets a need and solves a problem

Thorough - has depth of meaning that stands on its own

Elegant - captured in a way that is simple and clean

Unique - adds insights or value in new ways

As you move through these four, your idea gains value.

Aspire for full-spectrum ideas

Your messages must appeal to many different thinking styles.

Your messages must be applicable in many different situations.

Logical + creative

Specific examples + high-order contextual ideas

Develop your ideas so that they are mode agnostic

Balance robust information and simplicity.

Make ideas that seem so simple but are actually well-planned and crafted.

3 message outcomes to target

Clarity - accessible to most people most of the time

Flexible - can be used repeatedly in different forms

Integrity - received by others in a way that retains the original meaning

3 layers of an idea

Content - stuff you say that is specific

Concept - the point you are making

Context - the big picture theme that the idea is a part of

Each idea or point should be able to be captured on a single sheet of paper.

It creates a depth around your ideas and forces you to create messages with substance and balance.
