# An October Memory

I can still smell

the burger they sold

at the canteen

at grade school.

It was

a 10-peso burger

for goodness sake.

Ten pesos

and my baon was 20.

There we were,

lined up horizontally,

our hands,

no arms,

stuck through the railings

as if the canteen girls were

imprisoned loved ones

sentenced to be hanged

in a few hours.

"Ate, how much is that?"

"How about that?

"And that?"

Then

a canteen girl

finally noticed me.

Our eyes met,

mine wide,

her brow pulled up.

"Hm?" she moaned.

Short

but the sweetest sound

I've ever heard.

"Burger po," I demanded.

She grabbed one,

handed it to me

and I parted with my 10-peso bill.

I can still smell

the burger they sold

at the canteen

at grade school.

Is there any other memory

worth remembering

this cold

windy

October morning?
