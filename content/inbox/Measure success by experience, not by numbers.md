# Measure success by experience, not by numbers

Stop measuing success by numbers. Measure it by specific experiences that prove that your work connected and influenced the lives of others. How intimate? You need to be able to remember names, faces, and moments.

An object, token, or metric can represent what you hope for your work. They are easy answers to the question about where we want to go in our creative life. But they shouldnâ€™t be the goal.

When they are achieved, objects, tokens, and metrics do not provide the sense of validation and self-esteem that creators expected they will give. Instead, they create a sense of impostor syndrome.

When you frame success as an object, token, or metric, you only succeed when you get those, which happen infrequently. When you reframe success as producing an experience for yourself and for others, you can achieve it in a daily, weekly, and more consistent basis. Success becomes immediately more accessible.
