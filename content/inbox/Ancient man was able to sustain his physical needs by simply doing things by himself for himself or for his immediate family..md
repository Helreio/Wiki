# Ancient man was able to sustain his physical needs by simply doing things by himself for himself or for his immediate family.

Modern man is only able to sustain himself by pleasing many people indirectly (as an employee of a company) or directly (as a business).

This is the disconnect between the gift world and the transaction world.

- In the transaction world, you are here to please others (serve others).
- In the gift world, you only please yourself
