# Outer work enhances inner work

If, based on the science, [[Rich relationships lead to happiness]], then we can argue that working on our relationships (an outer work) enhances our inner state and with that how we perform inner work.

Of course, we cannot show up well in our relationships if we haven’t done our inner work first. And so it all starts with inner work. Although inner work can generate positive states of being, the experience of these states can only be made better by involving the Other. No one becomes happy by avoiding the Other and being too self-centered.

Now, the guiding principle that could help one’s inner work is also the guiding principle to improve our relationships: [[thoughts/compassion]].
