# How To Be A Naturalist The Easy Way

31 Highlights from How To Be A Naturalist The Easy Way

---

The most important thing when it comes to developing naturalist skills is that you need to put in “dirt time” (or time in the field). You need to get outside frequently and explore nature.

---

In my experience developing naturalist skills is much easier when you have lots of options for how to conduct your studies.

---

This is because some days you might be drawn to learning about birds. While other days you might be more interested in plants.

---

Experience has also shown me that people who study both plants AND birds are able to learn much more deeply and quickly than those who only study plants or birds in isolation.

---

This also enables you to shake things up. You can do a little bit with plants one day and then spend some time looking at trees or weather the next.

---

The really cool thing is that each different area of naturalist study will also give you insights and build skills for going deeper with the other areas of nature study.

---

Having options for how you study nature keeps things exciting because you get to “choose your own adventure”.

---

What am I excited to learn outside?What would be easy for me to do in the amount of time I have?What would be easy for me to do in the locations I have nearby?What areas of nature study am I most passionate about?What areas of nature study have I not done in awhile?

---

The basics of plant and tree identification are fairly easy to learn, but applying that knowledge to the many thousands of plants, birds and trees does take time, so remember to be patient with yourself.

---

Try collecting leaves, flowers, or anything else you might have trouble identifying. It’s a good idea to start by getting a local field guide and learning any potentially hazardous plants like poison ivy or poison oak (Don’t collect poisonous plants!)

---

So What Is The Easy Way To Be A Naturalist?

---

Building Your Identification Skills

---

Learning To Track Wildlife

---

Observing Animals In Their Natural Habitat

---

Animals will show you amazing things about their diet, survival strategies, movement patterns if you simply take the time to watch.

---

Animals will also teach you other things about the landscape by watching how common squirrels & rabbits interact with plants, trees & birds.

---

Edible & Medicinal Plant Knowledge

---

It’s one thing to recognize a plant outside… but it’s a whole other level to actually use that plant on a routine basis for food or medicine.

---

Listening To The Language Of Birds

---

I’ve used bird language to locate water, survival food resources and even the movements of predators like owls, hawks & wild cats by listening for bird alarms.

---

Seeking Deeper Awareness

---

When all else fails remember this…“Being a naturalist is simply about being aware of nature.”

---

The one routine that I consider to be most important is having a place outside where you can sit and observe nature on a regular basis.

---

Reading The Land Like A Pro

---

Another important part of being a naturalist is learning to see how everything fits together.

---

Being A Landscape Historian

---

Think about how people would have used your landscape hundreds or thousands of years ago…

---

Can you find evidence of historical usage by looking at water ways or old piles of stones that once were walls?

---

What can you learn about the traditional people who lived in your part of the world?

---

What stories and myths can you find with lessons about navigation, weather prediction, important trees, animals and plant uses?

---

How did traditional movement patterns and seasonal routines reflect the layout of the land?
