# On being a breadwinner

Lea’s main motivation for being a breadwinner is the guilt she is feeling for taking a long time at college and not pursuing dentistry. Giving back to her parents was something inculcated in her as a young child though and that influences her motivation although to a lesser degree.

I proposed that she look for a healthier motivation for what she is doing—love and compassion. Her taking on the role of the breadwinner, without hesitation, is the most compassionate response to take given what happened to her father and the pandemic.

I told her that I have only support to her if this is what she wants. I see what she is doing as her way of processing past mistakes and growing up as a person.

We both agreed that her role as a breadwinner will be cut off or significantly decreased once Dan and Kris Ann contributes to the family—that is in about five years time. Then and only then will we consider having a child. I told her that this arrangement is okay with me because given my current circumstances, I too am not yet ready to have a child. I still want to spend time learning about myself, what I want to do, and building up the skills I need to become a good dad (if ever).
