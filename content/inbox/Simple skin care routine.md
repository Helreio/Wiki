# Simple skin care routine

The simplest skin care routine only has three steps in the morning:

1. Cleansing
2. Moisturizing
3. Sunscreening

For cleansing, you can use Celeteque and follow the steps in [[How to use a cleanser]].

For moisturizing and sunscreening, use any of the [[Best moisturizers in the Philippines for oily skin]] and [[Best sunscreens in the Philippines for oily skins]]. Then follow the steps in [[How to apply sunscreen]].

This routine can be further simplified using a [[Moisturizing sunscreen]].

In the evening, you drop the third step. Since you donâ€™t want to waste your sunscreen for the evening when there is no sun, buy a stand-alone moisturizer for evening use only.
