# Notes on Rem Tanauan’s workshop on Love

# Part 1

Our understanding of love is usually framed from the perspective of the self rather than the other. We ask “how to be loved” or “how to be loveable” instead of “how to love”.

Because of the power of choice, romantic love emerged, and with it the objectification of love.

When is in the gift economy, it is given even when it isn’t asked. You give what you have. There is no price, so the value of what you give is determined by the receiver. You give even if you perceive that the value of what you receive is less than what you give. You love just because you love loving. Love becomes an art.

On the other hand, when love is in the transaction economy, it is being bought. You want to receive something with a similar value to what you give. You love because you want to be loved back. Love becomes business.

Myths

- Myths are not wrong.
- Myths are not correct either.
- Myths are the basis of judgment.
- Myths are fragmented realities.

Love is a process of thinking and contemplating.

Love is changing your perception.

Love is not material. It is not scarce. Love is immaterial. It is psychological. If it is psychological, it is infinite. We can generate it.

Transaction can lead to relation. Things you get from a transaction economy can be given as gifts in the gift economy.

# Part 2

Unconditional love is difficult, but that is why we have Jesus Christ and Buddha, and those who did it. They are examples we can model.

Love is faculty

- feeling, contemplative, intuitive, imaginative, understanding, and decision-making

Love is something attached to what we do or learn.

- Attitude
- Knowledge
- Concentration

What is the metaphysical status of love?

- Conceptual
- Physical

How can we talk about love without creating a logical contradiction?

Love is a concept, a relationship. It is in the platonic realm.

Love requires sentience.

Love requires a lover.

Love as nonjudging.

Nondjudgement = to see as is.

You need to let go of:

- Value
- Prescription

Nonjudgment as experienced in meditation

- Mind as a space (this is where we begin to see reality as it is)
- Contents of the mind

Nonjudgemental love is unconditional love.

It is difficult that is why it is a practice.

The problem with laws is that they prescribe something. Law implies judgement.
