# Feedback on Tungko

It's metaphysically prescriptive to the point where I feel like it is evangelizing. The question where does poetry come from is a very metaphysical question and talking about it makes me uncomfortable. I also don't think it contributes well to my practice of poetry itself. I can write poetry focus on the experience without even talking about where it comes from. I am interested in metaphysics but it is a very divisive subject and honestly I dont want to feel that divisiveness when I write poetry. I just want to focus on the experience itself. There were times when I feel like you were prescribing that this is what poetry is, this is how it happens, and I don't necessarily agree with your explanations. Actually, I feel like a big chunk of the course was metaphysical rather than technique or experience.

Teaching through metaphors, they're okay. But you could also abuse this and go to far and create confusion instead of clarity. A balance between metaphors and direct statements would have been ideal.

Because the course had an outline and assignments have specific steps, there were times when I feel like its not really facilitative. It felt like a traditional course. A facilitative course would have been more self-directed. You could have ask each of us what we want to experience from our practice. And then let us customize our own journey to discovering poetry. The weekly meets could have been checkups on our personal explorations. This is facilitative learning.

There should be explanations about the life of a poet, the every day practice of poetry, maintaining a practice. These are very important things but were not paid attention to. The emphasis was on the arrival of poetry. This ethic is not sustainable. Since after the course, I havent been writing much poetry when I should have. And I think this is due to the fact that the course did not teach that - how a poetry practice can be maintained.
