# Do not outsource the answers for the “How should I live?”

Living for someone vs living for yourself

When you live according to what a group of few elite people are telling you, you are living for someone and not yourself

Societal norm

Sacred book

Tradition

There's nothing wrong with this really.

But there might be a better way.

Before you sell your soul to this shining object that has baffled yourself. Maybe you should ask first

What is my self, my life, telling me about how I should live it. And have I listened to it and honored it enough so that I am now ready to listen to what others have to say.

You are uniquely capable of knowing how exactly to live your life. Do not outsource this right to anybody else.
