# Tiago's task management

Needs a quick capture for tasks

Just enter the task, no tagging or categorizing etc.

Projects list is dashboard (purpose: to see what is happening right now)

Don't use Areas. Just separate projects out of them.

Don't schedule someday or later projects

Uses a weekly review to determine what today tasks are in the coming week

Weekly Review

- Clear email inbox
- Check calendar (-2/+4 weeks)
- Clear physical inbox/notebook
- Clear computer desktop/downloads
- YNAB budget review
- Process Evernote inbox
- Prioritize and file new open loops (only two priorities: high or medium)
- Review Waiting for list followup
- Review GPhotos for images
- Choose Today tasks

Remember: Do the today tasks last in your review

Do the review at least once a week (twice if needed)

Work only on 5-10 items a week.

Don’t use your projects list as source of your to do list.

Let go of contexts.

“Doesn’t mean you can do something that you SHOULD do it.”

Context is no longer helpful because we have devices.

The better context is state of mind: Am I in the state of mind to finish a task? Do I have all the information I need? Is my mood or energy level ready for this?

This is a decision that cannot be fully automated.

Do it on a case by case basis.

Your Today list helps you make that decision in the moment as easily and quickly as possible. Except of selecting from hundreds, select from 10.
