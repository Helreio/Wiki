# Maybe I have found

Someone

To truly rely on

A human

Who understands

And cares about

The world

Within my world

Within my world

Whose perception

Trascends thought

And emotion

Maybe I have found her

A speck of dust in a sea of sand

A restful sleep in a long night

Maybe I have found her

And yet I refuse to look

And see

And accept

That she is

Whom I think

And the whole world thinks

She is
