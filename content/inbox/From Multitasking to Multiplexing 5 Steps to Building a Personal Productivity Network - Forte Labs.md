“In addition to the speed and resilience packet switching provides, and most importantly for our purposes, it also massively increases the throughput of information that can be transferred through a network.”

“It is because there is no single bottleneck or central hub through which all traffic has to flow. There is no single point of failure where a traffic jam can bring everything to a halt. Such a network starts to benefit from network effects: every additional node in the network improves the connections of all the other nodes, in a self-perpetuating cycle that can grow explosively.”

““personal productivity network” that gives even individuals the leverage of networks.”

“A network approach to personal productivity would reconceive our pipe as a network, with a capacity limited only by the number of nodes, and the intelligence with which they operate.”

“There are 2 things we need to accomplish to make it happen:

**Break our work down into packets**

I **ncrease the number and intelligence of our nodes”**

“5 Steps to Creating Packets”

“So our first task is to break up the blob into smaller parts.”

“What we need is to **create packets of work that are Stateful, Encapsulated, Reusable, and Composable, or SERC**:”

“#1 Stateful”

“ **it “remembers” (or saves) preceding events or user actions**.”

“all the thinking, content, and research that goes into the work we produce.”

“your tasks are not your work. They merely refer to the work that needs to be done. If I destroyed your task list, your work wouldn’t be destroyed. You’d have another to do list generated in no time!”

“Our work is actually made up of content”

“all the intermediate information we collect, utilize, generate, and incorporate along the way:”

“This possibility is intimidating, because this content is stunningly diverse, complex, and ambiguous. It can’t be made into a simple list like tasks. And it’s often difficult to see how it’s valuable or how it could be used outside the context of the current project.”

“But this is the work of our lives. Think about how much time and effort we put into formulating our tasks, and how little into managing the knowledge gained from performing those tasks.”

“ **Step 1: Collect all this content from all the places where it lives, into a centralized location where it can be organized** ”

“note-taking apps.”

“ **The best paradigm for how to think about “packets of content” is not documents, files, components, or modules, but “notes.”** ”

“Notes are:

Personal, informal, quick and dirty:”

“Open-ended and never finished”

“Low expectations for quality/polish”

“Mix diverse types of media”

“#2 Encapsulated”

“we need to **“package up” our work into discrete, self-contained units**.”

“Once you have your work content collected in one place, the next step is to break it down into discrete packets, which in note-taking apps are known as “notes”:”

“ **Step 2: Separate your content into small packets with clean edges (i.e. notes)** ”

“How you break it up is up to you, but use common sense:

all the notes on a book should probably go together, whereas notes from different articles should be separate”

“images from a single website should probably go together, while images from different locations should be in separate notes”

“your brainstorm ideas on a single project should probably go together, while random ideas you have in the shower should probably be separate”

“#3 Reusable”

“For knowledge work, the benefits of reusability should be obvious: you save time and effort by using content you’ve already produced.”

“If you reuse some research you did in the past for a new project, you’ve retroactively doubled the productivity of that research. It’s produced double the output with the same amount of input.”

“reusability doesn’t happen automatically. **It requires some effort to make sure the note will be recognizable and understandable at some future date, without too much extra effort. This involves adding “meta-data” to the note, such that it can be organized and tracked** ”

“Meta-data can take on a wide variety of forms, but some common ones include:

**Informative titles: describe accurately and succinctly what this note contains**

**Thematic tags: include tags that label the note according to common themes**

**Concise summary: summarize briefly what this note is about, so your future self will know if it’s worth reading in its entirety**

**Comments and annotations: add your own comments, so your future self will know what you thought about this note**

**Bolding and highlighting: call out the best or most interesting parts, so your future self won’t have to find them again**

**Links and images: include different types of media, which can make future review more engaging and vivid”**

““designing the note.” You’re not just archiving something you’re never going to see again. You’re putting some thought into how your future self will evaluate and use the note.”

“ **Step 3: Design notes for easy search and retrieval** ”

“Note that this is a continuous process from here on out, not a one-time deal.”

“Your future self is not going to wade through thousands of old notes hoping to come across something of value. They will likely ask two questions when starting a new project:

What have I worked on similar to this before?

What do I know about this topic?”

“ **Step 4: Organize your notes by project and topic** ”

“This ensures that you have a minimal amount of structure around the thousands of notes you will be collecting.”

“#4 Composable”

“ **we need to be able to quickly and easily combine our notes into more complex packages**. This is the whole point of capturing all this information in the first place.”

“This starts with the typical ways we have of retrieving saved information:

**searching (for keywords, titles, or terms)**

**filtering or sorting (by date or other criteria)**

**browsing (perusing notebooks or folders that seem relevant to the task at hand)** ”

“But beyond that it depends a lot on what medium you’re working in. This starts to get into the creative process, which can never be fully organized and structured.”

“Instead of passively reading or watching, you want to produce something out of your learning (as in productivity).”

“Producing a tangible artifact has numerous benefits over mere consumption:

activates deeper parts of the brain, integrating the senses with your physical movements

provides an experience for you to remember and put what you learned in context

gives you something tangible to share and get feedback on from others

tests your theoretical knowledge against the hard constraints of reality, to see how well you can use it”

“At some point you may want to use a specialized program to do the above, but until then, manage that content in a simple notebook.”

“ **Step 5: Practice composing things** ”

“Don’t separate learning from making. The more you make, the more incentives you’ll have to improve your personal knowledge management (PKM).”

“we want to expand the capacity of our personal network to handle them.”

“Node: any work session where intelligence is applied”

“Nodes are your own work sessions over time. When I make a note to self and put it on the fridge, I am transmitting that packet of data through time to my future self. Same thing goes when I summarize an abstract theory I read in a book — I know that most of the details will be quickly lost from my memory, so I’m choosing which ones I want to preserve for future review.”

“Nodes include other people. When I ask a collaborator to perform an action, whether over the phone, through email or Slack, or in the form of an Asana task, I am creating a neat little packet of work. Once the necessary intelligence has been applied and some value added, they will (hopefully) send back a packet of “processed” content, which I can then integrate into what I’m doing.”

“Nodes include software programs.”

“Working with software generally takes especially careful packaging, because computers can only understand information they were designed to understand.”

“Nodes include organizations.”

“You can probably see the close parallel to manufacturing. Once we have a network, all the tools of process improvement, network science, and supply chain management become available to us. We can invest in capacity, marketing, or distribution. We can analyze the value stream, measure throughput at different points, and test ideas in research & development.”

“With ourselves at the nexus of this personal productivity network, we gain immense leverage. Tasks that we don’t want to or can’t perform get routed through the network, picking up intelligence along the way. This can look like tweeting a question to your followers, getting a crowdsourced list of ideas from your newsletter subscribers, or asking a collaborator who you have some social capital with to help you.”

“ **It begins to be to your benefit to share as much of the network as possible, because sharing inspires growth.** You can give away most of your content for free, because any value created eventually flows to you. You’re immune to competition, because no one can replace you at the center of your network. You can use the network as a platform for the ideas and projects of others, giving them exposure in exchange for yet more value creation.”

“As the owners and managers of a personal productivity network, we step back from the role of “individual contributor,””

“ **We move from being “knowledge workers” to “knowledge managers,” walking the catwalk high above to oversee our factory and think holistically about how all the parts interact.** ”

“What we’re really talking about here is **building a system. A system of people, software, and organizations working together in an integrated way, with our own personal efforts dedicated increasingly to tweaking and tuning how the system operates. You could call this system your “second brain.** ””

“Such a system has far greater abilities than any individual, including its owner. It intakes your experience and learning and outputs deliverables and projects, capturing and recycling every bit of knowledge produced along the way. It steadily accumulates intellectual capital:”

“Such a system works day and night, and is measured by value created, not hours worked. Such a system is not limited by the bandwidth of one person’s time, by the limits of one person’s knowledge, or by the level of one person’s capabilities.”

“The “bandwidth” of such a system is limited only by the intelligence and skill with which you manage, improve, and expand your network beyond the limits of your human self. Once it reaches critical mass, it grows almost without your involvement. After that point, its expansion is limited only by your ability to get out of the way.”

“Becoming a network is how you increase your productivity 100-fold.”
