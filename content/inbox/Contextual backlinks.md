# Contextual backlinks

An example of a contextual backlink is what shows up when you click a backlink in Craft. The backlink does not just show the title of a reference, it also shows the paragraph from where the title appeared.

This allows you to see clearly how a note relates to its backlink (i.e., [[Prefer clear associations]]).
