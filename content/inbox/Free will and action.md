I can see now where free will is problematic. It requires me to believe that *choice is not affected by causality*. But can it be indirectly influenced by it? No it can’t be influenced by anything. It is volitional. Somehow, somewhere in the mechanics of decision-making or acting, a metaphysical category that does not follow the rules of causality takes center stage and determines the results.

Okay, now that we’re not even sure if free will exists, how do we go on living? My drawing above relies on causality. It may not be metaphysically accurate and bullet-proof but it can explain action.
