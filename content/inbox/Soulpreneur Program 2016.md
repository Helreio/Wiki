Book: “You Can Heal Your Life"

Your fear is your message.

“I’m here only to be truly helpful.

I’m here to represent that which sent me.

I don’t have to worry about what to say or do

Because that which sent me will direct me.

I’m happy just to be here

Knowing that all grace is within me.

I will be healed as I let the healing happen through me."

Write the book for yourself.

Training from others is necessary.

But sometimes, we are our own teachers as well.

Write your social media post to yourself (it may be a younger you).

We are not here to fix anyone.

We are not here to save the world.

The way we create the shift in the planet is by healing ourselves.

(Remember: We are not separate)

We relate to each other because we are not separate.

Make the younger you (or that version of you who got depressed) feel safe.

It is so important to incorporate nature in our lives.

Ask your younger self what he needs.

**1. You need a non-negotiable spiritual practice.**

It’s not you doing the work.

Energies want to work through you.

You need to have devotion to your spiritual practice.

Discipline

- [ ] from disciples
- [ ] don’t need to be hard work

**2. You need to follow your intuition**

- [ ] Follow your intuition even when it does’t make sense. Especially when it doesn’t make sense.

**3. You need to follow what lights you up.**

- [ ] Let the feminine come up.
- [ ] The struggle mindset or being at war with your career or with others should be let go.

Nature

Beauty

It’s not about strategising how this could happen.

It’s about the spirit that’s constantly calling you.

Life is actually really easy.

Let your work emerge from you.

Your people are you. They’re just younger than you. You are your ideal audience.

The annoying thing about being awake is that you can’t get back to sleep.

You have chosen this path in this time in history.

You chose your parents.

You have everything you need to rise up.

Your tragedies happened for you not to you.

Life is more about getting it wrong

You are in the right track especially when you are lost.

The very things that you will teach are the very things that you have to learn.

To find your light you first need to venture in the shadows of your ego.

In order to be a bright light in the world you need to come home to who you really are and then show it to everyone around you.

**Bullshit in the Online World**

1. Ego
2. Lack of integrity
3. Comparison Trap

Medical Intuitive

Marie Forleo’s B-School

Leave the online world or just be inauthentic?

Online world was inauthentic.

Even without expertise, people position themselves as experts as long as they:

- Have savvy marketing
- Look good
- Manage to get a lot of social media followers

Comparison

Pressure to look a certain way

Pressure to behave on a certain market-y way

Built my career by talent and talent alone and experience and hard work.

Not promote myself as something that I wasn’t.

People pretend to be who they want to be not who they really are.

You don’t have to sell out.

You just have to align with yourself.

I am a truth teller.

Don’t write a raving testimonial to someone if you don’t really think that what they are doing is good.

**1. This whole online world, it’s changing.**

Those who really are expert at something, those who know about something, should stand up and talk about it.

People are starting to say, give me what’s real, give me the wisdom, give me the experience.

We need to share our message but we need to do it in a way that feels good and does not feel icky.

We can do the real and we can do it in our own terms.

**2. If you want to be successful (whatever success is in your own terms), you need to have a completely transparent non-negotiable, non-biased, relationship with your own Self (or your own intuition).**

That is the only way to define success.

It’s the only way for you to live your truth.

It’s the only way for you to do what lights you up.

We live in a largely ego-ic money grabbing world.

Every single day, be honest with your own self.

Dedicate to a spiritual practice.

Commit yourself to being honest about what’s going on inside yourself.

---

Marketing strategy

- [ ] rubbing noses with famous people

Learn marketing in an organic way.

How to act authentically?

- [ ] Have a completely transparent relationship with your own Self.

Dedicate yourself to spiritual practices.

Look after yourself daily.

Spiritual Practices

- Chakra Work
- White Light Work
- Mindfulness Work

Daily non-negotiables

These spiritual practices keep me aligned, keep me authentic, allows me to work authentically.

Check in with yourself every day

- Are you aligned with your chakras?
- Are you aligned with your energy?
- How do you feel?

You can navigate through the egotistic behaviors in the online world.

The nature of the online world is egoic.

What it does is to make you feel your inadequacies.

It shows you what’s not working in your life.

Use your chakra 3 in your day to day life.

Chakra 3 = intuition/gut feel

Using your chakra 3 provides you with what you need at that particular moment immediately

You don’t want to collaborate with chakra 3 weak people (passive-aggressive).

Chakra 3 weak people cannot say what they mean and mean what they say.

When your chakra 3 is strong, you also strengthen the chakra 3 of the person you are connecting with.

Light worker = as you align yourself, you help others align themselves.

When you work with your chakras, you heal the world one chakra at a time.

Your only job is to vibrationally heal yourself because only through that can you assist people.

***It doesn’t matter what your message is or how good you look, if you are not coming vibrationally from strength and alignment you are not helping out the planet (period).***

We’re in an age of transparency.

We’re all awakening our psychic side.

# *Question for February 9*

I have started a blog but I don’t know where it should really go.

Right now, I’m blogging regularly but not really reaching out to build the platform simply because I am not confident about my message.

I am not sure of it is worth building.

Sometimes, I just want to scrap the project altogether and start from ground zero.

Getting clarity on what my platform should represent is obviously one of the things I want to achieve in this program.

But I also realised that this confusion on where to go is based on two things:

1. I’m still not 100% sure about the work I’m here to do.
2. I’m not yet fully healed.

Rebecca Campbell’s talk made this all clear to me and the following statement from her struck me really hard:

We are not here to fix anyone.

We are not here to save the world.

The way we create the shift in the planet is by healing ourselves.

These words made me realised that more than building a business, I am here primarily to heal.

Because that is what creates the shift. And our businesses as soulpreneurs should contribute to that shift right?

So, here’s the problem.

Can I genuinely, authentically, help others (and make money doing so), when I myself am healing?

Can my healing be my message, my service?

If so, how can I make it my message and my service?

What are the possible avenues of translating this into a business that can bring abundance in my life?

---

Questions to ask:

Topic

On my blog

On my sustenance

I have an existing blog and

Healing myself as my message and service.

It’s what I’m expert about.

How do I go about translating that into the work that I want to do?

What if the work that I want to do don’t seem to make money?

Or will make me money but will do so in the future?

How do I juggle between my current job and this dream career?

I make a living as a freelance writer. I make money through it but I want to be more than just a freelance writer.

What I want to be is a blogger who inspires others through my story.

Clear:

**I want to write about my story.**

Will people pay me to do that?

I want [vincentimbat.com](http://vincentimbat.com) to represent my ideal work.

I’m torn between building a freelance client base and building my dream career on the blog.

Should I create a website just for my writing services and separate that from the more authentic blog?

Is it right to build 2 businesses at the same time?

Or should I find a job instead then just focus on growing my blog?

# *Ezzie Spencer*

She didn’t plan her soulful abundant business.

She just followed what felt good one step at a time.

She was making a difference through law but it did not come from a soulful abundant place.

She always knew that her purpose was to make a difference in other people’s lives.

Push and hustle all the time is glorified in our society.

Going to our intellect all the time is glorified in our society.

Meditation

Journaling

Cumulative effect of a consistent spiritual practice.

- [ ] connect with the Divine, the Earth, your body

Do what is FUN!

One on one teaching

Then group teaching

Then an online program

She started thinking that this was a FUN hobby.

She didn’t think about it like her soulpreneur path.

Did free sessions with women in her first year.

Because it was something she really liked to do.

Did her apprenticeship.

Built a word of mouth business through the apprenticeship.

Charged sessions in her second year.

$50/hour

pocket money

She did it on the side for a long time

But she felt she was really mastering her craft

She built confidence on something she knew she can give value on others through

Go slow

If you really want to build a soulful abundant business, go slow.

::When you are starting a business, keep your doors open to other forms of income so you do have the luxury of allowing your business to be slow burn if that is what it is.::

The crossroads of should and must (book)

Don’t quit your day job. Not too soon.

Don’t denigrate your day job.

What are the parts of your current day job that is really, really benefiting you?

You want to avoid that state where you need another person’s money to get through a month. The energy of that is repulsive.

Your day job will help your business to evolve in a way that it wants to.

Also, think about the skills that you are developing at your current day job and how you can bring them in the business you are building.

There are shadow paths of a career. But there are also beautiful parts of that career.

Look for those gems in your current day job.

Mastering your craft is so much more important than mastering your marketing.

Remember that even if you are running a soulful business, it’s important for you to understand that it still is a business, we are in earth and it is a commercial entity.

Abundance is more about the living, being in a state of overflow.

Abundance is about receiving and giving. Giving in a place of abundance - you feel so good to give.

This happens when you feel that you are already supported.

Be in a place where you trust nature to provide the abundance that you need.

Abundance will only happen when people are drawn to you.

And they will only be drawn to you when you are embodying something that is elusive - people want to work with you and want to be around you.

When you have mastered your craft and you live in abundance, people will want to work with you.

There is an art to this and that art is beautifully mundane and is based in these very real world practices as well as being really, really magical.

# *Question for March 8*

After going through the worksheets my intuition is leading me into believing that I may have to make changes on how I look at my career and platform and how I present it to the world. They’re not very clear yet but I feel like I will be making both big and small changes in the very near future.

My question concerns how we can best apply what we learn from the course when we already have an existing business or platform?

How do we approach the problem of “making changes?”

Should we do changes gradually or abruptly?

When do we make the smaller changes?

When do we make the bigger changes?

# *Wes Carr*

You may have the best idea in the world but if you don’t have self-worth, that idea will not surface and it will feel too hard.

Intention

- No expectation
- Giving of service
- Giving more than receiving

The quick fix never works.

What am I doing it for?

Who am I doing it for?

How am I doing it?

If you have the right intentions then you are in the right path.

Then you just have to trust that.

Trust yourself.

Put self-doubt in the cage.

Treat your clients as your friends. They’re not your clients.

# *Sarah Wilder on Passion*

Her idea was special because it came at exactly where she was at that point in time

Focus on the why of what you’re doing

When you learn so much about yourself is when your business grows

# *Julie Parker*

Look and research for a good coaching school, style, and tradition that you resonate with in a personal level. After you do this, everything will be in place.

Choose a reputable school because coaching is generally unregulated.

Couselling - for unwell people

Coaching - for well people who want to achieve something

Build an amazing referral database (relationships)

Networking = Connecting

It doesn't matter if you're relationships are online.

To get your first paying client as a coach, be very selective with who you choose to do pro bono coaching with. Choose those who can help you with referrals in the future.

Be upfront and offer to coach them for free.

Ask for testimonials and referrals upfront.

You need to have a very targeted ideal client and a niche.

Work out what is your passion point?

Make sure that you brand yourself authentically.

Be you.

Know that you're enough.

Do this and the flow of clients will be open and easy.

Remember that coaching is a skill and it takes time to develop.

1. Coaching is not about you as the coach. It's about the client.

Focus on them rather than you.

2. You should develop intuitive listening.

Hear what is not being said.

3. Be present.
4. Be a great cheerleader, encourager.

Many people go to a coach for support and love.

How can coaches diversify their business?

Ecourse

Ebooks

Workshops

1. Whatever you're doing/creating, answer a very2 specific need of your ideal client or niche.
2. Make sure you have been building an engaged tribe (list of subscribers and social media followers).

You need to do this so someone will buy what you create.

Tips for hiring

1. Choose people that you like and with whom you can be warm and open with.
2. Skills

Hire people who are the right fit even if they lack the skills.

3. Personally create your coach charter.
