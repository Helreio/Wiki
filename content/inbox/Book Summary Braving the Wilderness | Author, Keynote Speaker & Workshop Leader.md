8 Highlights from Book Summary: Braving the Wilderness | Author, Keynote Speaker & Workshop Leader

“You are only free when you realize you belong no place—you belong every place—no place at all. The price is high. The reward is great.” Brown discovered that trying to fit in does not accomplish a sense of belonging but finding ways to trust others and our own selves, does. Sometimes, we need to risk rejection.

---

The Wilderness Brown uses the analogy of being in the wilderness to describe the times we choose to be firm in our values which tend to separate us from others.

---

Trust Trust plays a significant role in belonging, trusting yourself and others. Brown describes seven aspects of trust. We can notice these behaviors in others and ourselves. 1. Respecting boundaries. Responding respectfully to the response of no. 2. Being reliable. Keeping agreements. 3. Being accountable. Acknowledging mistakes, apologizing, and making amends. 4. Being in integrity. Deciding based on values and demonstrating the courage to take a stand. 5. No judging. Sharing and accepting needs and feelings without judgment. Being curious when not understanding. 6. Believing the best. Believing that intentions are basically good.

---

Brown explores the phrase strong back, soft front. Strong back means strengthening our boundaries, staying reliable, accountable and honest, living with integrity, while continuing to give and receive. Soft back means allowing ourselves to take risks, to be vulnerable and feel what we feel.

---

“We must sometimes stand alone in our decisions and beliefs despite our fear of criticism and rejection. . . (and end up in) the wilderness.”

---

“True belonging is the spiritual practice of believing in and belonging to yourself so deeply that you can share your most authentic self with the world and find sacredness in both being a part of something and standing alone in the wilderness. True belonging doesn’t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are.”

---

“As we think about our journey from ‘fitting in” to striding into the wilderness of true belonging, we will be well served by understanding and recognizing the boundaries of respecting everyone’s physical safety, and not participating in experiences or communities that utilize language and/or engage in behaviors that dehumanize people.”

---

“People are hard to hate close up. Move in. Speak truth to bullshit. Be civil. Hold hands. With strangers. Strong back. Soft front. Wild heart.”
