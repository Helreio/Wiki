# Life Reminders

I have to remember that I have a different situation.

I have a disability.

I have to accept this and treat the healing process as my art itself.

Accept your situation.

Love it.

Develop acceptance.

Avoid the desire to change your situation or change other people to conform to your situation.

Be kind.

Just accept.

Just observe.

Take things one step at a time

Treat life like a yoga practice

Choose one step and do it mindfully

I devote this life to knowing the Self.

This life is connected to the fulfilment and championing of the great spiritual truths.

This will be my calling. The communion with the Divine through yoga, self-expression, service, and adventure.

My Life Was Filled With Adventures

Living your life is your purpose.

Living within a more positive version of the story of your life is the key to achieving that purpose.

Life is a story written in a journal book. Life is a large meditation practice.

Life is a large yogic practice.

Look at your life as a redemptive journey.
