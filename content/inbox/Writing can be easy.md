# Writing can be easy

Ease can be used as an organizing principle when writing. If we don’t have to use willpower, we set ourselves to success. [[A writing practice and a note-writing system makes publishing easier]] and we can set these up in such a way that we use less willpower.

Our system should allow us to do two things:

1. Stop when we're stuck and do something else.
2. Not force us to do anything we don’t want to do.

Ironically, we can create an impressive body of work not in spite of writing with ease but because of it, as [[Niklas Luhmann]] did.

One way to make writing easy is to [[Break down your work into small and clearly separated tasks]].

To do

- Literature note. Cultivate it to become a permanent note.
