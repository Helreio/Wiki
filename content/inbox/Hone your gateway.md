# Hone your gateway

As you can hone your craft, you can also hone your gateway (i.e., hone how you engage with your audience).

To hone audience engagement, you will use habits, observation, and experimentation. Everyday you do it, it becomes more authentic.

This involves:

1. Finding your people.
2. Researching what resonates with them.
3. Finding people like you who are looking for them.
4. Bringing them to your gate one-by-one.
