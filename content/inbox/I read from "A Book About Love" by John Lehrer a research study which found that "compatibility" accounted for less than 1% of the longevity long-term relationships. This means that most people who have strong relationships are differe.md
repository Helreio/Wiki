I read from "A Book About Love" by John Lehrer a research study which found that "compatibility" accounted for less than 1% of the longevity long-term relationships. This means that most people who have strong relationships are different in many things but still somehow manage to be successful in their partnership. What made the biggest difference, according to the study, was how partners expressed their feelings, which boils down to "communication."

It's the number one thing I am looking for in my next relationship. I hope to find someone who could communicate her thoughts and feelings and who is able to balance this with listening. I believe that no matter how different we might be, if we can communicate well, we always have the chance of being in a successful relationship.

On a related note, good communication gives way to solving misunderstandings (and don't we have a lot of these in relationships?). I am looking for someone who would care for me deeply to allow for compromises to happen, where her needs and my needs are met halfway. I want to enjoy a non-toxic relationship and for two people coming from very different backgrounds to build something that will succeed, will require a lot of compromises.

I'm an introverted person, not shy, just introverted, which means that crowds overwhelm me. I express myself best when I'm talking with someone one-on-one. When I'm in a relationship, I really strive to express myself so I could be understood. I don't withhold anything.

Aside from good communication, I'm looking for open-mindedness. I'm a well-rounded person with lots of interests. I have studied different subjects in my free time (philosophy, economics, spirituality, health, etc.) and have exposed myself to different points of view. Over the years, I have become mild in my positions about different things because I want to be careful not to commit myself on beliefs that I'm not totally sure about. I detest dogmatism especially when based on very weak foundation. I hope to find someone who has a similar tendency, who isn't quick to judge situations as "bad" or "immoral," someone who is willing to listen to evidence and contrarian opinions. I am someone who you might describe as "unconventional," not necessarily in how I live my life, but in my views about things. So, I hope to be with someone who could listen to my views even if she might not totally agree with them.

Health is very important to me. It's something I've always been working on. I never smoked anything and I only drink alcohol socially (but intend to avoid it for now). I exercise a few times a week and I do meditation. Eating good food is something I'm trying to cultivate. I would very much enjoy being with someone who values health, perhaps even more than I do. I want to be encouraged by someone to pursue a healthy lifestyle. I think success in any relationships won't be possible if partners are always unwell and stressed out.

One thing that's also important to me is my views on money. The way I see it, many lives could have been better if people's relationship with money was transformed. I value efficiency so I only consume what I need and only work for what I need. I'm a minimalist and simplicity advocate. I believe if we spend less time worrying about money, we will be able to spend more time doing the more important things in life like creating and loving. I'm interested to see if we might have similar views.

Overall, I'm looking for someone who is emotionally mature, who knows what she wants and is able to act accordingly. I'm still a work in progress, but I can promise you I have learned important lessons in life and I believe I have good things I could bring to the table.

By the way, I'm serious with my intentions here. I'm looking for something genuine, hopefully long-lasting. In case you think we're a match, send me a message (if I haven't send one to you yet!). I would love to get to know you a bit here. But after a few chats, expect me to ask you if we could meet in person (or over Skype, if distance is a problem for now). While talking online is fun, I might create a wrong impression of who you really are if we prolong our communication here. To avoid that, I want to be with you in person. I hope you see the wisdom in this.

My idea of a first date would be to chat over coffee (or anything light). If things go well, then let's collaborate for a second date :)
