# Feeling Good

# Introduction

Your feelings result from the messages you give yourself. In fact, your thoughts often have much more to do with how you feel than what is actually happening in your life.

You can learn to change the way you think about things, and you can also change your basic values and beliefs. And when you do, you will often experience profound and lasting changes in your mood, outlook, and productivity. That, in a nutshell, is what cognitive therapy is all about.

Feeling Good bibliotherapy may be as effective as a full course of psychotherapy or treatment with the best antidepressant drugs. Given the tremendous pressures to cut health care costs, this is of considerable interest, since a paperback copy of the Feeling Good book costs less than two Prozac pills—and is presumably free of any troublesome side effects!

Although they experienced the normal ups and downs we all feel from time to time, approximately half indicated that when they were upset, they opened up Feeling Good and reread the most helpful sections.

Remember that you can use the cognitive bibliotherapy between therapy sessions to speed your recovery even if you are in treatment.

# Chapter 1 - A Breakthrough in the Treatment of Mood Disorders

**3 Principles behind CBT**

1. **All your moods are created by your “cognitions,” or thoughts.** A cognition refers to the way you look at things—your perceptions, mental attitudes, and beliefs. It includes the way you interpret things—what you say about something or someone to yourself. You feel the way you do right now because of the thoughts you are thinking at this moment.
2. **When you are feeling depressed, your thoughts are dominated by a pervasive negativity.** You perceive not only yourself but the entire world in dark, gloomy terms. What is even worse—you’ll come to believe things really are as bad as you imagine them to be. If you are substantially depressed, you will even begin to believe that things always have been and always will be negative. As you look into your past, you remember all the bad things that have happened to you. As you try to imagine the future, you see only emptiness or unending problems and anguish. This bleak vision creates a sense of hopelessness. This feeling is absolutely illogical, but it seems so real that you have convinced yourself that your inadequacy will go on forever.
3. **Negative thoughts which cause your emotional turmoil nearly always contain gross distortions.** Although these thoughts appear valid, you will learn that they are irrational or just plain wrong, and that twisted thinking is a major cause of your suffering. The implications are important. Your depression is probably not based on accurate perceptions of reality but is often the product of mental slippage. You can learn to deal with your moods more effectively if you master methods that will help you pinpoint and eliminate the mental distortions which cause you to feel upset. As you begin to think more objectively, you will begin to feel better.

The effectiveness of cognitive therapy should be encouraging for individuals who prefer not to rely on drugs to raise their spirits, but prefer to develop an understanding of what is troubling them and do something to cope with it.

Clinical experience has shown that all individuals do not respond as rapidly, but most can nevertheless improve if they persist for a longer period of time. Sometimes this is hard work!

The combination of antidepressant drugs with cognitive therapy can be more effective than either modality above. In my experience the most crucial predictor of recovery is a persistent willingness to exert some effort to help yourself. Given this attitude, you will succeed.

I am convinced that you can experience beneficial effects if you are willing to apply the methods described in this book with persistence and consistency.

Part of being human means getting upset from time to time, so I can guarantee you will not achieve a state of never-ending bliss! This means you will have to reapply the techniques that help you if you want to continue to master your moods. There’s a difference between feeling better—which can occur spontaneously—and getting better—which results from systematically applying and reapplying the methods that will lift your mood whenever the need arises.

# Chapter 2 - How to Diagnose Your Moods: The First Step in the Cure

Use the BDC to monitor your progress at least once a week

Use it between sessions with your physician.

**The Goal of Your Treatment**

When your score is under ten, you will be in the range considered normal. When it is under five, you will be feeling especially good. Ideally, I’d like to see your score under five the majority of the time. This is one aim of your treatment.

The crucial decision to try to help yourself is the key that will allow you to feel better as soon as possible, regardless of how severe your mood disturbance might seem to be.

If your score remains in the range of 11-25 for more than a few weeks, you should consider professional treatment. The help of a therapist or an antidepressant medication may considerably speed your recovery.

Your conviction that you are hopeless is the reason to seek treatment, not suicide.

Your feeling that you are hopeless is powerful evidence that you are actually not!

# Chapter 3 - Understanding Your Moods: You Feel the Way You Think

Depression is not an emotional disorder at all!

Every bad feeling you have is the result of your distorted negative thinking. Illogical pessimistic attitudes play the central role in the development and continuation of all your symptoms.

Every time you feel depressed about something, try to identify a corresponding negative thought you had just prior to and during the depression. Because these thoughts have actually created your bad mood, by learning to restructure them, you can change your mood.

I call negative thoughts “automatic thoughts.” They run through your mind automatically without the slightest effort on your part to put them there. They are as obvious and natural to you as the way you hold a fork.

Your emotions result entirely from the way you look at things. It is an obvious neurological fact that before you can experience any event, you must process it with your mind and give it meaning. You must understand what is happening to you before you can feel it.

It is not the actual events but your perceptions that result in changes in mood.

If your understanding of what is happening is accurate, your emotions will be normal. If your perception is twisted and distorted in some way, your emotional response will be abnormal. Depression falls into this category. It is always the result of mental “static”—distortions.

When you are depressed, you possess the remarkable ability to believe, and to get the people around you to believe, things which have no basis in reality.

**1. All-or-Nothing Thinking**

This refers to your tendency to evaluate your personal qualities in extreme, black-or-white categories.

All-or-nothing thinking forms the basis for perfectionism. It causes you to fear any mistake or imperfection because you will then see yourself as a complete loser, and you will feel inadequate and worthless.

This way of evaluating things is unrealistic because life is rarely completely either one way or the other.

Absolutes do not exist in this universe. If you try to force your experiences into absolute categories, you will be constantly depressed because your perceptions will not conform to reality. You will set yourself up for discrediting yourself endlessly because whatever you do will never measure up to your exaggerated expectations. The technical name for this type of perceptual error is “dichotomous thinking.” You see everything as black or white—shades of gray do not exist.

**2. Overgeneralization**

You arbitrarily conclude that one thing that happened to you once will occur over and over again. Since what happened is invariably unpleasant, you feel upset.

The pain of rejection is generated almost entirely from overgeneralization. In its absence, a personal affront is temporarily disappointing but cannot be seriously disturbing.

**3. Mental Filter.**

You pick out a negative detail in any situation and dwell on it exclusively, thus perceiving that the whole situation is negative.

When you are depressed, you wear a pair of eyeglasses with special lenses that filter out anything positive. All that you allow to enter your conscious mind is negative. Because you are not aware of this “filtering process,” you conclude that everything is negative. The technical name for this process is “selective abstraction.” It is a bad habit that can cause you to suffer much needless anguish.

**4. Disqualifying the Positive.**

An even more spectacular mental illusion is the persistent tendency of some depressed individuals to transform neutral or even positive experiences into negative ones. You don’t just ignore positive experiences, you cleverly and swiftly turn them into their nightmarish opposite.

If you have been depressed, you may have developed the talent for doing the exact opposite—you can instantly transform golden joy into emotional lead. Not intentionally, however—you’re probably not even aware of what you’re doing to yourself.

**5. Jumping to Conclusions.**

You arbitrarily jump to a negative conclusion that is not justified by the facts of the situation. Two examples of this are “mind reading” and “the fortune teller error.”

MIND READING: You make the assumption that other people are looking down on you, and you’re so convinced about this that you don’t even bother to check it out.

THE FORTUNE TELLER ERROR: It’s as if you had a crystal ball that foretold only misery for you. You imagine that something bad is about to happen, and you take this prediction as a fact even though it is unrealistic.

**6. Magnification and Minimization.**

Also “binocular trick” because you are either blowing things up out of proportion or shrinking them. Magnification commonly occurs when you look at your own errors, fears, or imperfections and exaggerate their importance.

You’re looking at your faults through the end of the binoculars that makes them appear gigantic and grotesque. This has also been called “catas-trophizing” because you turn commonplace negative events into nightmarish monsters.

When you think about your strengths, you may do the opposite—look through the wrong end of the binoculars so that things look small and unimportant. If you magnify your imperfections and minimize your good points, you’re guaranteed to feel inferior. But the problem isn’t you—it’s the crazy lenses you’re wearing!

**7. Emotional Reasoning.**

You take your emotions as evidence for the truth.

This kind of reasoning is misleading because your feelings reflect your thoughts and beliefs. If they are distorted—as is quite often the case—your emotions will have no validity.

Emotional reasoning plays a role in nearly all your depressions. Because things feel so negative to you, you assume they truly are. It doesn’t occur to you to challenge the validity of the perceptions that create your feelings.

One usual side effect of emotional reasoning is procrastination.

**8. Should Statements.**

You try to motivate yourself by saying, “I should do this” or “I must do that.” These statements cause you to feel pressured and resentful. Paradoxically, you end up feeling apathetic and unmotivated.

When you direct should statements toward others, you will usually feel frustrated.

Should statements generate a lot of unnecessary emotional turmoil in your daily life. When the reality of your own behavior falls short of your standards, your shoulds and shouldn’ts create self-loathing, shame, and guilt. When the all-too-human performance of other people falls short of your expectations, as will inevitably happen from time to time, you’ll feel bitter and self-righteous. You’ll either have to change your expectations to approximate reality or always feel let down by human behavior.

**9. Labeling and Mislabeling.**

Personal labeling means creating a completely negative self-image based on your errors. It is an extreme form of overgeneralization. The philosophy behind it is “The measure of a man is the mistakes he makes.” There is a good chance you are involved in a personal labeling whenever you describe your mistakes with sentences beginning with “I’m a …”

Labeling yourself is not only self-defeating, it is irrational. Your self cannot be equated with any one thing you do. Your life is a complex and ever-changing flow of thoughts, emotions, and actions. To put it another way, you are more like a river than a statue. Stop trying to define yourself with negative labels—they are overly simplistic and wrong.

When you label other people, you will invariably generate hostility.

Mislabeling involves describing an event with words that are inaccurate and emotionally heavily loaded.

**10. Personalization.**

This distortion is the mother of guilt! You assume responsibility for a negative even when there is no basis for doing so. You arbitrarily conclude that what happened was your fault or reflects your inadequacy, even when you were not responsible for it.

Personalization causes you to feel crippling guilt. You suffer from a paralyzing and burdensome sense of responsibility that forces you to carry the whole world on your shoulders. You have confused influence with control over others. In your role as a teacher, counselor, parent, physician, salesman, executive, you will certainly influence the people you interact with, but no one could reasonably expect you to control them. What the other person does is ultimately his or her responsibility, not yours.

---

Your feelings are not facts! In fact, your feelings, per se, don’t even count—except as a mirror of the way you are thinking.

What is the key to releasing yourself from your emotional prison? Simply this: Your thoughts create your emotions; therefore, your emotions cannot prove that your thoughts are accurate. Unpleasant feelings merely indicate that you are thinking something negative and believing it.

I want to teach you to avoid painful feelings based on mental distortions, because they are neither valid nor desirable. I believe that once you have learned how to perceive life more realistically you will experience an enhanced emotional life with a greater appreciation for genuine sadness—which lacks distortion—as well as joy.

# Chapter 4 - Start by Building Self-Esteem

Depressed patients expressed self-dislike.

Depressed patients see themselves as deficient in the very qualities they value most highly: intelligence, achievement, popularity, attractiveness, health, and strength.

A depressed self-image can be characterized by the four D’s: You feel Defeated, Defective, Deserted, and Deprived.

Almost all negative emotional reactions inflict their damage only as a result of low self-esteem.

A poor self-image is the magnifying glass that can transform a trivial mistake or an imperfection into an overwhelming symbol of personal defeat.

If you are now depressed or have ever been depressed, you may find it much harder to recognize the illogical thinking patterns which cause you to look down on yourself. In fact, you are probably convinced that you really are inferior or worthless. And any suggestion to the contrary is likely to sound foolish and dishonest.

Unfortunately, when you are depressed you may not be alone in your conviction about your personal inadequacy. In many cases you will be so persuasive and persistent in your maladaptive belief that you are defective and no good, you may lead your friends, family, and even your therapist into accepting this idea of yourself.

What is the source of genuine self-esteem? This, in my opinion, is the most important question you will ever confront.

First, you cannot earn worth through what you do. Achievements can bring you satisfaction but not happiness. Self-worth based on accomplishments is a “pseudo-esteem,” not the genuine thing!

Nor can you base a valid sense of self-worth on your looks, talent, fame, or fortune.

Nor can love, approval, friendship, or a capacity for close, caring human relationships add one iota to your inherent worth. The great majority of depressed individuals are in fact very much loved, but it doesn’t help one bit because self-love and self-esteem are missing.

At the bottom line, only your own sense of self-worth determines how you feel.

One of the cardinal features of cognitive therapy is that it stubbornly refuses to buy into your sense of worthlessness.

Are you really right when you insist that somewhere inside you are essentially a loser?

The first step is to take a close look at what you say about yourself when you insist you are no good. The evidence you present in defense of your worthlessness will usually, if not always, make no sense.

There is actually a formal thinking disturbance in depressed patients.

During periods of depression you lose some of your capacity for clear thinking; you have trouble putting things into proper perspective. Negative events grow in importance until they dominate your entire reality—and you can’t really tell that what is happening is distorted. It all seems very real to you. The illusion of hell you create is very convincing.

The more depressed and miserable you feel, the more twisted your thinking becomes. And, conversely, in the absence of mental distortion, you cannot experience low self-worth or depression!

The most usual mental distortion to look out for when you are feeling worthless is all-or-nothing thinking. If you see life only in such extreme categories, you will believe your performance will be either great or terrible—nothing else will exist.

Not only is this all-or-nothing system of self-evaluation highly unrealistic and self-defeating, it creates overwhelming anxiety and frequent disappointment.

**Overcoming the Sense of Worthlessness**

- Unless you substantially reverse your self-defeating thinking and behavior patterns, you are likely to slip back again into depression.
- Pinpointing the nature or origin of your problem may give you insight, but usually fails to change the way you act.
- You have been practicing for years and years the bad mental habits that helped create your low self-esteem. It will take systematic and ongoing effort to turn the problem around.
- As a cognitive therapist, I have three aims in dealing with your sense of worthlessness: a rapid and decisive transformation in the way you think, feel, and behave. These results will be brought about in a systematic training program that employs simple concrete methods you can apply on a daily basis. If you are willing to commit some regular time and effort to this program, you can expect success proportionate to the effort you put in.
- You will have to work at it and practice the various exercises. In fact, I recommend that you set some time aside each day to work at improving your self-image because only in this way can you experience the fastest and most enduring personal growth.

**Specific Methods for Boosting Self-Esteem**

*1. Talk back to that internal critic*

a. Train yourself to recognize and write down the self-critical thoughts as they go through your mind.

b. Learn why these thoughts are distorted.

c. Practice talking back to them so as to develop a more realistic self-evaluation system.

*Triple-column Technique*

1. Automatic Thoughts
2. Cognitive Distortion
3. Rational Response (Self Defense)

The aim is to substitute more objective rational thoughts for the illogical, harsh self-criticisms that automatically flood your mind when a negative event occurs.

You do not try to cheer yourself up by rationalizing or saying things you do not believe are objectively valid. Instead, try to recognize the truth.

If what you write down in the Rational Response column is not convincing and realistic, it won’t help you one bit. Make sure you believe in your rebuttal to self-criticism. This rational response can take into account what was illogical and erroneous about your self-critical automatic thought.

Suppose you cannot think of a rational response to a particular negative thought. Then just forget about it for a few days and come back to it later. You will usually be able to see the other side of the coin.

As you work at the triple-column technique for fifteen minutes every day over a period of a month or two, you will find it gets easier and easier. Don’t be afraid to ask other people how they would answer an upsetting thought if you can’t figure out the appropriate rational response on your own.

Start by writing down your automatic thoughts and rational responses for fifteen minutes every day for two weeks and see the effect this has on your mood, as measured by the Burns Depression Checklist. You may be surprised to note the beginning of a period of personal growth and a healthy change in your self-image.

One note of caution: Do not use words describing your emotional reactions in the Automatic Thought column. Just write the thoughts that created the emotion.

The simple exercise of answering your negative thoughts with rational responses on a daily basis is at the heart of the cognitive method. It is one of the most important approaches to changing your thinking. It is crucial to write down your automatic thoughts and rational responses; do not try to do the exercise in your head. Writing them down forces you to develop much more objectivity than you could ever achieve by letting responses swirl through your mind. It also helps you locate the mental errors that depress you.

*Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts*

While it’s best not to describe your emotions in the Automatic Thought column, it can be quite helpful to do some “emotional accounting” before and after you use the triple-column technique to determine how much your feelings actually improve. You can do this very easily if you record how upset you are between 0 and 100 percent before you pinpoint and answer your automatic thoughts.

A slightly more elaborate form developed by Dr. Aaron Beck called the Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts allows you to record not only your upsetting thoughts but also your feelings and the negative event that triggered them.

If you are unwilling to pick up the tool and use it, you won’t be able to do the job. Start by writing down your automatic thoughts and rational responses for fifteen minutes every day for two weeks and see the effect this has on your mood, as measured by the Burns Depression Checklist. You may be surprised to note the beginning of a period of personal growth and a healthy change in your self-image.

The simple exercise of answering your negative thoughts with rational responses on a daily basis is at the heart of the cognitive method. It is one of the most important approaches to changing your thinking. It is crucial to write down your automatic thoughts and rational responses; do not try to do the exercise in your head. Writing them down forces you to develop much more objectivity than you could ever achieve by letting responses swirl through your mind. It also helps you locate the mental errors that depress you.

*2. Mental Biofeedback*

Monitor negative thoughts using a wrist counter.

Click the button each time a negative thought about yourself crosses your mind; be on the constant alert for such thoughts. At the end of the day, note your daily total score and write it down in a log book.

At first you will notice that the number increases; this will continue for several days as you get better and better at identifying your critical thoughts. Soon you will begin to notice that the daily total reaches a plateau for a week to ten days, and then it will begin to go down. This indicates that your harmful thoughts are diminishing and that you are getting better. This approach usually requires three weeks.

Systematic self-monitoring frequently helps develop increased self-control.

This is no substitute to the Triple-Column Technique though.

*3. Cope, Don’t Mope!—The Woman Who Thought She Was a “Bad Mother.*

When you are down on yourself, you might find it helpful to ask what you actually mean when you try to define your true identity with a negative label.

Once you begin to pick these destructive labels apart, you will find they are arbitrary and meaningless. They actually cloud the issue, creating confusion and despair. Once rid of them, you can define and cope with any real problems that exist.

Summary

Because of the negative emotional and behavioral consequences of your harsh thinking, the first step is to stop telling yourself you are worthless.

You must first consider that a human life is an ongoing process that involves a constantly changing physical body as well as an enormous number of rapidly changing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Your life therefore is an evolving experience, a continual flow. You are not a thing; that’s why any label is constricting, highly inaccurate, and global. Abstract labels such as “worthless” or “inferior” communicate nothing and mean nothing.

Your feelings do not determine your worth, simply your relative state of comfort or discomfort. Rotten, miserable internal states do not prove that you are a rotten, worthless person, merely that you think you are; because you are in a temporarily depressed mood, you are thinking illogically and unreasonably about yourself.

Just as your feelings do not determine your worth, neither do your thoughts or behaviors. Some may be positive, creative, and enhancing; the great majority are neutral. Others may be irrational, self-defeating, and maladaptive. These can be modified if you are willing to exert the effort, but they certainly do not and cannot mean that you are no good. There is no such thing in this universe as a worthless human being.

Then how can I develop a sense of self-esteem?” you may ask. The answer is—you don’t have to! You don’t have to do anything especially worthy to create or deserve self-esteem; all you have to do is turn off that critical, haranguing, inner voice. Why? Because that critical inner voice is wrong! Your internal self-abuse springs from illogical, distorted thinking. Your sense of worthlessness is not based on truth, it is just the abscess which lies at the core of depressive illness.

Crucial Steps

1. Zero in on those automatic negative thoughts and write them down. Don’t let them buzz around in your head; snare them on paper!
2. Read over the list of ten cognitive distortions. Learn precisely how you are twisting things and blowing them out of proportion.
3. Substitute a more objective thought that puts the lie to the one which made you look down on yourself.

# Chapter 5 - Do-Nothingism: How to Beat It

Change the way you feel by changing the way you act.

Why do you voluntarily impose a similar punishment on yourself? Do you want to suffer? Using cognitive techniques, you can discover the precise reasons for your difficulties in motivating yourself.

Depressed patients improve if they try to help themselves.

**Models of Procrastination**

1. Trait Model
2. Enjoyable Suffering Model
3. Passive Aggressive Model
4. Payoff Model

Simply ask yourself, “When I think about that undone task, what thoughts immediately come to mind?” Then write those thoughts down on a piece of paper. What you write will reflect a number of maladaptive attitudes, misconceptions, and faulty assumptions. You will learn that the feelings that impede your motivation, such as apathy, anxiety, or the sense of being overwhelmed, are the result of distortions in your thinking.

The Lethargy Cycle - Your self-defeating negative thoughts make you feel miserable. Your painful emotions in turn convince you that your distorted, pessimistic thoughts are actually valid. Similarly, self-defeating thoughts and actions reinforce each other in a circular manner. The unpleasant consequences of do-nothingism make your problems even worse.

All your emotions and actions are the results of your thoughts and attitudes.

Similarly, your feelings and behavior patterns influence your perceptions in a wide variety of ways.

It follows from this model that all emotional change is ultimately brought about by cognitions; changing your behavior will help you feel better about yourself if it exerts a positive influence on the way you are thinking.

Thus, you can modify your self-defeating mental set if you change your behavior in such a way that you are simultaneously putting the lie to the self-defeating attitudes that represent the core of your motivational problem.

Similarly, as you change the way you think, you will feel more in the mood to do things, and this will have an even stronger positive effect on your thinking patterns. Thus, you can transform your lethargy cycle into a productivity cycle.

**Mindsets associated to Do-nothingism and Procrastination**

1. Hopelessness
2. Helplessness
3. Overwhelming Yourself
4. Jumping to Conclusions
5. Self-labeling
6. Undervaluing the Rewards
7. Perfectionism
8. Fear of Failure - Remind yourself: You can only control the INPUT not the PRODUCT of your efforts. So don’t judge your success according to your PRODUCT.
9. Fear of Success
10. Fear of Disapproval or Criticism
11. Coercion and Resentment
12. Low Frustration Tolerance - Change your expectations. Not reality.
13. Guilt and Self-Blame

Do you know why virtually any meaningful activity has a decent chance of brightening your mood? If you do nothing, you will become preoccupied with the flood of negative, destructive thoughts. If you do something, you will be temporarily distracted from that internal dialogue of self-denigration. What is even more important, the sense of mastery you will experience will disprove many of the distorted thoughts that slowed you down in the first place.

As you review the following self-activation techniques, choose a couple that appeal most to you and work at them for a week or two. Remember you don’t have to master them all! One man’s salvation can be another’s curse. Use the methods that seem the most tailored to your particular brand of procrastination.

**Methods to Battle Do-Nothingism**

1. The Daily Activity Schedule
2. The Antiprocrastination Sheet
3. Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts
4. The Pleasure Predicting Sheet
5. But Rebuttal
6. Self-Endorsement

***7. TIC (Task Interfering Cognitions) - TOC (Task-oriented Cognitions) Technique***

If you are procrastinating about getting down to a specific task, take note of the way you are thinking about it. These TICs, or Task-Interfering Cognitions, will lose much of their power over you if you simply write them down and substitute more adaptive TOCs, or Task-Oriented Cognitions, using the double-column technique. A number of examples are shown in Figure 5–8. When you record your TIC-TOCs, be sure to pinpoint the distortion in the TIC that defeats you. You may find, for example, that your worst enemy is all-or-nothing thinking or disqualifying the positive, or you may be in the bad habit of making arbitrary negative predictions. Once you become aware of the type of distortion that most commonly thwarts you, you will be able to correct it. Your procrastination and time-wasting will give way to action and creativity.

You can also apply this principle to mental images and daydreams as well as to thoughts. When you avoid a task, you probably automatically fantasize about it in a negative, defeatist fashion. This creates unnecessary tension and apprehension, which impairs your performance and increases the likelihood that your dreaded fear will actually come true.

In the left-hand column, record the thoughts that inhibit your motivation for a specific task. In the right-hand column, pinpoint the distortions and substitute more objective, productive attitudes.

***8. Little Steps For Little Feet***

A simple and obvious self-activation method involves learning to break any proposed task down into its tiny component parts. This will combat your tendency to overwhelm yourself by dwelling on all the things you have to do.

Here’s how you can beat the boredom, defeat the distraction, and increase your ability to concentrate: Break the task down into its smallest component parts!

This technique will enable you to maintain a more effective level of overall concentration. Giving yourself permission to dwell on distracting thoughts for short periods will diminish their power over you. After a while, they will seem ludicrous.

An extremely useful way to divide a task into manageable units is through time limitation. Decide how much time you will devote to a particular task, and then stop at the end of the allotted time and go on to something more enjoyable, whether or not you’re finished. As simple as this sounds, it can work wonders.

Do you tend to bite off bigger pieces than you can comfortably chew? Dare to put modest time limits on what you do! Have the courage to walk away from an unfinished task!

***9. Motivation Without Coercion***

“Can’t Lose” System

It’s your thoughts and only yours that are making you feel terrible; you’re the only person in the world who can effectively persecute yourself.

# Chapter 6

- Overcoming your fear of criticism will require a moderate amount of practice. But it is not difficult to develop and master this skill, and the positive impact on your self-esteem will be tremendous.
- You must realize that it is not other people, or the critical comments they make, that upset you.
- No matter how vicious, heartless, or cruel these comments may be, they have no power to disturb you or to create even a little bit of discomfort.
- Only one person in this world has the power to put you down—and you are that person, no one else!
- When another person criticizes you, certain negative thoughts are automatically triggered in your head. Your emotional reaction will be created by these thoughts and not by what the other person says.
- The first step in overcoming your fear of criticism concerns your own mental processes: Learn to identify the negative thoughts you have when you are being criticized. It will be most helpful to write them down using the double-column technique described in the two previous chapters. This will enable you to analyze your thoughts and recognize where your thinking is illogical or wrong. Finally, write down rational responses that are more reasonable and less upsetting.
- To put it succinctly, if people criticize you the comments they make will be right or wrong. If the comments are wrong, there is really nothing for you to be upset about. Think about that for a minute!
- Why should you be disturbed if someone else makes the mistake of criticizing you in an unjust manner? That’s the other guy’s error, not yours. Why upset yourself? Did you expect that other people would be perfect?
- On the other hand, if the criticism is accurate, there is still no reason for you to feel overwhelmed. You’re not expected to be perfect. Just acknowledge your error and take whatever steps you can to correct it. It sounds simple (and it is!), but it may take some effort to transform this insight into an emotional reality.
- Of course, you may fear criticism because you feel you need the love and approval of other people in order to be worthwhile and happy. The problem with this point of view is that you’ll have to devote all your energies to trying to please people, and you won’t have much left for creative, productive living. Paradoxically, many people may find you less interesting and desirable than your more self-assured friends.
- The crux of the matter is that only your thoughts can upset you and if you learn to think more realistically, you will feel less upset. Right now, write down the negative thoughts that ordinarily go through your head when someone criticizes you. Then identify the distortions and substitute more objective rational responses. This will help you feel less angry and threatened.

**Verbal Techniques**

What can you say when someone is attacking you? How can you handle these difficult situations in a way that will enhance your sense of mastery and self-confidence?

1. Empathy
2. Disarming the Critic - Whether your critic is right or wrong, initially find some way to agree with him or her./ You will notice you have a profound, almost irresistible tendency to defend yourself when you are unjustly accused. This is a MAJOR mistake! If you give in to this tendency, you will find that the intensity of your opponent’s attack increases! You will paradoxically be adding bullets to that person’s arsenal every time you defend yourself.
3. Feedback and Negotiation - Explain your position and emotions tactfully but assertively, and to negotiate any real differences./ You can express your point of view objectively with an acknowledgment you might be wrong. Make the conflict one based on fact rather than personality or pride. Avoid directing destructive labels at your critic. Remember, his error does not make him stupid, worthless, or inferior./ In many cases you will be just plain wrong, and the critic will be right. In such a situation your critic’s respect for you will probably increase by an orbital jump if you assertively agree with the criticism, thank the person for providing you with the information, and apologize for any hurt you might have caused./ “The crucial point is not whether or not you express your feelings, but the manner in which you do it./ If you defend yourself from negative feedback in a defensive and vengeful way, you will reduce the prospect for productive interaction in the future.

The third option requires that you either have self-esteem or at least act as if you did. It is based on the premise that you are a worthwhile human being and have no need to be perfect. When you are criticized, your initial response is investigative. Does the criticism contain a grain of truth? Just what did you do that was objectionable? Did you in fact goof up?

Having defined the problem by asking a series of non-judgmental questions, you are in a position to propose a solution. If a compromise is indicated, you can negotiate. If you were clearly in the wrong, you can admit it. If the critic was mistaken, you can point this out in a tactful manner.

But whether your behavior was right or wrong, you will know that you are right as a human being, because you have finally perceived that your self-esteem was never at issue in the first place.

**Irritability Quotient**

The amount of anger and annoyance you tend to absorb and harbor in your daily life. “If you have a particularly high IQ, it puts you at a great disadvantage because you overreact to frustrations and disappointments by creating feelings of resentment that blacken your disposition and make your life a joyless hassle.

**Scale**

0—You would feel very little or no annoyance.

1—You would feel a little irritated.

2—You would feel moderately upset.

3—You would feel quite angry.

4—You would feel very angry.

**Two Primary Ways To Deal With Anger**

1. Anger turned inward
2. Anger turned outward

**Cognitive Solution to Anger**

Stop creating your anger. You don’t have to choose between holding it in or letting it out because it won’t exist.

**Who Is Making You Angry?**

- Other people really cannot make you angry.
- No matter how outrageous or unfair others might appear to you, they do not, never did, and never will upset you. The bitter truth is that you’re the one who’s creating every last ounce of the outrage you experience.

**How Anger Happens**

- Anger, like all emotions, is created by your cognitions.
- Before you can feel irritated by any event you must first become aware of what is occurring and come to your own interpretation of it. Your feelings result from the meaning you give to the event, not from the event itself.
- Plenty of genuinely negative events do go on every day, but your feelings about them are still created by the interpretations you place on them. Take a careful look at these interpretations because anger can be a two-edged sword. The consequences of an impulsive outburst will frequently defeat you in the long run. Even if you are being genuinely wronged, it may not be to your advantage to feel angry about it. The pain and suffering you inflict on yourself by feeling outraged may far exceed the impact of the original insult.
- In many cases your anger is created by subtle cognitive distortions. As with depression, many of your perceptions are twisted, one-sided, or just plain wrong. As you learn to replace these distorted thoughts with others that are more realistic and functional, you will feel less irritable and gain greater self-control.

**Cognitive Distortions Common To Anger**

***1. Labeling***

- When you label someone, you create the impression that he or she has a bad essence. You are directing your anger toward what that person “is.”
- When you write people off this way, you catalog in your mind’s eye every single thing about them you don’t like (the mental filter) and ignore or discount their good points (disqualifying the positive). This is how you set up a false target for your anger.
- In reality, ::every human being is a complex mix of positive, negative, and neutral attributes.::
- Labeling is a distorted thinking process that causes you to feel inappropriately indignant and morally superior. It’s destructive to build your self-image this way: Your labeling will inevitably give way to your need to blame the other person. Your thirst for retaliation intensifies the conflict and brings out similar attitudes and feelings in the person you’re mad at. Labeling inevitably functions as a self-fulfilling prophecy. You polarize the other person and bring about a state of interpersonal warfare.
- What’s the battle really all about? Often you’re involved in a defense of your self-esteem. The other person may have threatened you by insulting or criticizing you, or by not loving or liking you, or by not agreeing with your ideas.
- You cannot enhance your own esteem by denigrating someone else even if it does feel good temporarily.
- There is one and only one person in this world who has the power to threaten your self-esteem—and that is you. Your sense of worth can go down only if you put yourself down. The real solution is to put an end to your absurd inner harangue.

***2. Mind Reading***

- You invent motives that explains to your satisfaction why the other person did what he or she did. These hypotheses are frequently erroneous because they will not describe the actual thoughts and perceptions that motivated the other person. Due to your indignation, it may not occur to you to check out what you are saying to yourself.
- Common explanations you might offer for the other person’s objectionable behavior would be “He has a mean streak”; “She’s unfair”; “He’s just like that”; “She’s stupid”; “They’re bad kids”; and so forth.
- The problem with these so-called explanations is that they are just additional labels that don’t really provide any valid information. In fact, they are downright misleading.

***3. Magnification***

- \-If you exaggerate the importance of the negative event, the intensity and duration of your emotional reaction may get blown up out of all proportion.

***4. Should and Shouldn’t Statements***

- When you find that some people’s actions are not to your liking, you tell yourself they “shouldn’t” have done what they did, or they “should have” done something they failed to do.
- When you insist on perfection from others, you will simply make yourself miserable and become immobilized.
- Irrational should statements rest on your assumption that you are entitled to instant gratification at all times. So on those occasions when you don’t get what you want, you go into panic or rage because of your attitude that unless you get X, you will either die or be tragically deprived of joy forever (X can represent love, affection, status, respect, promptness, perfection, niceness, etc.). This insistence that your wants be gratified at all times is the basis for much self-defeating anger. People who are anger-prone often formulate their desires in moralistic terms such as this: If I’m nice to someone, they should be appreciative.
- Other people have free will, and often think and act in ways that aren’t to your liking. All of your insistence that they must fall in line with your desires and wishes will not produce this result. The opposite is more often true. Your attempts to coerce and manipulate people with angry demands most often will alienate and polarize them and make them much less likely to want to please you. This is because other people don’t like being controlled or dominated any more than you do. Your anger will simply limit the creative possibilities for problem solving.
- There is no such thing as a universally accepted concept of fairness and justice. There is an undeniable relativity of fairness.
- “Absolute fairness” does not exist. “Fairness” is relative to the observer, and what is fair to one person can appear quite unfair to another. Even social rules and moral strictures which are accepted within one culture can vary substantially in another. You can protest that this is not the case and insist that your own personal moral system is universal, but it just ain’t so!”
- Fairness is simply a perceptual interpretation, an abstraction, a self-created concept.
- In spite of the fact that “absolute fairness” does not exist, personal and social moral codes are important and useful. I am not recommending anarchy. I am saying that moral statements and judgments about fairness are stipulations, not objective facts. ”
- If you fail to act in a manner that takes into account the feelings and interests of others you are likely to end up less happy because sooner or later they will retaliate when they notice you are taking advantage of them.
- A system which defines “fairness” varies in its generality depending on how many people accept it. When a rule of behavior is unique to one person, other people may see it as eccentric.
- When a rule is nearly universally accepted it becomes part of a general moral code and may become a part of the body of law.
- Nevertheless, no amount of general acceptance can make such systems “absolute” or “ultimately valid” for everyone under all circumstances.
- Much everyday anger results when we confuse our own personal wants with general moral codes. When you get mad at someone and you claim that they are acting “unfairly,” more often than not what is really going on is that they are acting “fairly” relative to a set of standards and a frame of reference that differs from yours. Your assumption that they are “being unfair” implies that your way of looking at things is universally accepted. For this to be the case, everyone would have to be the same. But we aren’t. We all think differently. When you overlook this and blame the other person for being “unfair” you are unnecessarily polarizing the interaction because the other person will feel insulted and defensive. Then the two of you will argue fruitlessly about who is “right.” The whole dispute is based on the illusion of “absolute fairness."
- Because of your relativity of fairness, there is a logical fallacy that is inherent in your anger. Although you feel convinced the other guy is acting unfairly, you must realize he is only acting unfairly relative to your value system. But he is operating from his value system, not yours. More often than not, his objectionable action will seem quite fair and reasonable to him. Therefore, from his point of view—which is his only possible basis for action—what he does is “fair.” Do you want people to act fairly? Then you should want him to act as he does even though you dislike what he does, since he is acting fairly within his system! You can work to try to convince him to change his attitudes and ultimately modify his standards and his actions, and in the meantime you can take steps to make certain you won’t suffer as a result of what he does. But when you tell yourself, “He’s acting unfairly,” you are fooling yourself and you are chasing a mirage!

**Two Criteria to Determine Whether Anger Is Productive Or Not**

Actually, anger can be adaptive and productive in certain situations. So the real question is not “Should I or should I not feel anger?” but rather “Where will I draw the line?

The following two guidelines will help you to determine when your anger is productive and when it is not. These two criteria can help you synthesize what you are learning and to evolve a meaningful personal philosophy about anger:

1. Is my anger directed toward someone who has knowingly, intentionally, and unnecessarily acted in a hurtful manner?
2. Is my anger useful? Does it help me achieve a desired goal or does it simply defeat me?

The adaptive and positive effects of your anger differentiate it from hostility, which is impulsive and uncontrolled and leads to aggression.

**Anger Management Methods**

**1. Develop the Desire**

*The Anger Cost-Benefit Analysis*

The first step: Use the double-column technique to make a list of the advantages and disadvantages of feeling angry and acting in a retaliatory manner. Consider both the short-and long-term consequences of your anger. Then review the list and ask yourself which are greater, the costs or the benefits? This will help you determine if your resentment is really in your best self-interest. Since most of us ultimately want what’s best for us, this can pave the way for a more peaceful and productive attitude.

It is crucial that you perform this same type of analysis as a first step in coping with your anger. After you list the advantages and disadvantages of your anger, give yourself the same test. Ask yourself, if the upsetting situation that provokes me doesn’t change immediately, would I be willing to cope with it instead of getting angry? If you can answer yes, then you are clearly motivated to change. You will probably succeed in gaining greater inner peace and self-esteem, and you will increase your effectiveness in life. This choice is up to you.

**COOL THOSE HOT THOUGHTS**

Once you’ve decided to cool down, an invaluable method that can help you is to write down the various “hot thoughts” that are going through your mind when you are upset. Then substitute less upsetting, more objective “cool thoughts,” using the double-column method.

You can also use the more elaborate chart, the “Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts,” to deal with your anger. You can describe the provocative situation and assess how angry you feel before and after you do the exercise.

**IMAGINING TECHNIQUE**

One helpful technique is to transform them in a creative way so they become less upsetting. Humor represents one powerful tool you can use.

A second method involves thought stoppage. As you notice the images crossing your mind each day, remind yourself that you have the right to turn the projector off. Think about something else. Find someone and engage him or her in conversation. Read a good book. Bake bread. Go jogging. When you don’t reward the anger images with your arousal, they will recur less and less often. Instead of dwelling on them, think about an upcoming event that excites you, or switch to an erotic fantasy. If the upsetting memory is persistent, engage in vigorous physical exercise such as pushups, rapid jogging, or swimming. These have the additional benefit of rechanneling your potentially hurtful arousal in a highly beneficial way.

**REWRITE THE RULES**

You may frustrate and upset yourself needlessly because you have an unrealistic rule about personal relationships that causes you to be let down all the time.

If your relationships are characterized by this cyclic tension and tyranny, you may be better off rewriting the rules. If you adopt a more realistic attitude, you can end your frustration. It’s much easier than trying to change the world.

It’s an undeniable fact that human relationships, including marriages, are rarely spontaneously “reciprocal” because people are different. Reciprocity is a transient and inherently unstable ideal that can only be approximated through continued effort. This involves mutual consensus, communication, compromise, and growth. It requires negotiation and hard work.

If you have a “should” or “shouldn’t” rule that has been causing you disappointment and frustration, rewrite it in more realistic terms. You will notice that the substitution of one word—“it would be nice if” in place of “should”—can be a useful first step.

**LEARN TO EXPECT CRAZINESS**

**ENLIGHTENED MANIPULATION**

In addition to motivating the people you care about to want to be around you, it will improve your mood because you learn to notice and focus on the positive things that others do rather than dwell on their negatives.

**SHOULD REDUCTION**

Because many of the thoughts which generate your anger involve moralistic “should” statements, it will help you to master some “should” removal methods. One way is to make a list, using the double-column method, of all the reasons why you believe the other person “shouldn’t” have acted as he did. Then challenge these reasons until you can see why they are unrealistic and don’t actually make good sense.

The rationale for eliminating your “should” statement is simple: It’s not true that you are entitled to get what you want just because you want it. You’ll have to negotiate.

**NEGOTIATING STRATEGIES**

If you want to exert your influence in an effective way instead of moping angrily and creating inner turmoil, a calm, firm, assertive approach will usually be the most successful.

As you stop consuming your energy in anger, you can focus your efforts on getting what you want.

1. Compliment then negotiate.
2. Disarm him by agreeing to him.
3. Clarify your point of view again clearly and calmly.

Repeat the above three techniques over and over in varying combinations he gives in or an acceptable compromise is reached. Use ultimatums and intimidating threats only as a last resort, and make sure you are ready and willing to follow through when you do.

Avoid labelling him in an insulting way or implying he is bad, evil, malignant, etc. If you decide to tell him about your negative feelings, do so objectively without magnification or an excess of inflammatory language.

**ACCURATE EMPATHY**

# Cognitive Distortion

**1. ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING:** You see things in black-and-white categories. If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.

**2. OVERGENERALIZATION:** You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.

**3. MENTAL FILTER:** You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that colors the entire beaker of water.

**4. DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE:** You reject positive experiences by insisting they “don’t count” for some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences.

**5. JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS:** You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support your conclusion.

**a. Mind reading.** You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you, and you don’t bother to check this out.

**b. The Fortune Teller Error.** You anticipate that things will turn out badly, and you feel convinced that your prediction is an already-established fact.

**6. MAGNIFICATION (CATASTROPHIZING) OR MINIMIZATION:** You exaggerate the importance of things (such as your goof-up or someone else’s achievement), or you inappropriately shrink things until they appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or the other fellow’s imperfections). This is also called the “binocular trick.”

**7. EMOTIONAL REASONING:** You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: “I feel it, therefore it must be true.”

**8. SHOULD STATEMENTS:** You try to motivate yourself with shoulds and shouldn’ts, as if you had to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything. “Musts” and “oughts” are also offenders. The emotional consequence is guilt. When you direct should statements toward others, you feel anger, frustration, and resentment.

**9. LABELING AND MISLABELING:** This is an extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: “I’m a loser.” When someone else’s behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to him: “He’s a goddam louse.” Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded.

**10. PERSONALIZATION:** You see yourself as me cause of some negative external event which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.

# List of Distorted Thoughts

***I feel so alone. After I left the church I was not able to establish good relationships. I am not part of an invested community. I tried to establish several communities after my depression but I failed. Right now I am alone and my relationships are also not healthy. That’s why I am lonely and depressed. I’m stuck. I won’t be able to feel better.***

Being part of the church does not make one insulated from loneliness. If that is the case then you should’ve had depression. Even people inside churches feel left out and alone. Yes, being part of a church gives you a lot of chance for group events and gatherings which is important for your health but it doesn’t mean you will never be lonely when you are at church.

What you are doing right now which is nurturing your relationships one person at a time is the right thing to do. Real intimate relationships last. It’s a form of service and your self is also served. Conversations with purpose which you are doing right now feels genuine.

You don’t need to be part of a church to feel happy. Do not compare where you are now from where you were before and conclude that life was better before. No. You are more free right now. It’s something you didn’t have before. Yes, you are alone most of the time but doesn’t mean you always will be. You are doing the right things. Just be patient and continue. Get more confident with yourself slowly but surely. You will soon find your tribe your community. Remember what Dave told you, you are on your path, just be patient.

***Every afternoon, I’m left with so little energy and so few things to do.***

Why not cook instead and share what you’ve made?

---

My family, where I live in right now doesn’t talk much with each other. It makes me uncomfortable and forces me to be judgemental about them most of the time - because I feel uncomfortable. We’re eating together and yet almost no one talks. We’re inside the house together but no one really cares to ask how did my day went or how do I feel or what do I want to do with my life. It makes me sad because I went through depression because of these very reasons and wanted to kill myself. I feel like by that fact alone they should have learned their lesson and take better care of me now. But I feel not. They’re still the same. Especially my father. He doesn’t care one thing about what I am passionate about, he doesn’t support me or follow up on whatever expressions of support he made in the past. It saddens me because I want to get angry and get back on him but I know it’s wrong. And yet he should change, he should be better than this. That’s my problem.

1. I’m a victim and I lost the fight. I was not able to give justice to all the maltreatment that they did to us. Because instead of fighting, I withdrew and refused to bring the matter to the authorities.

Labeling

All-or-Nothing Thinking

I am not a victim. I just chose to follow a peaceful path. I chose not to make the issue bigger and bring it to the authorities because I value EMOTIONAL HEALTH and I know that this venture will cause me a lot of stress. I think what I did is in resonance with what Jesus Christ, Mahatma Ghandi, and the Buddha did. They chose to forgive and follow the peaceful path. Because of this, I think I deserve to be called a victor!

There is no one way of attacking this problem. There are many ways. It doesn’t mean that if I was not able to bring justice or bring a measure of revenge or punishment to them, doesn’t mean that my method of dealing with the problem is a failure. I did not fail in this issue. I simply chose a better way of doing things. And this decision brought me peace of mind, self-confidence and self-control. I think my decision was a personal success!

2. This place is no longer a good place to stay in. I hear the voices of the neighbours and every time I do so, I feel like they are living a good life while we don’t. Because they were able to impose their will and do what they want to do and we were not able to do that to them. Because they were able to do this in the past, they will do this in the future and this place will be even worse.

Nope. This place has positive things in it. In fact, before all of these happened, you like it here. Your family lives here. All your childhood memories happened here. Food is good here. Internet is good here. The wind is good here. The temperature is better here. You can play basketball and ride your bike here. Your dogs are here. Your cozy bed is here. Your room is here. Your guitar is here. This place is wonderful. You just don’t see the positive because you filter them out simply because of the fact that the neighbours are bothering you.

Just because you feel like you don’t live a good life like they do doesn’t mean it is true. You know for a fact that you have a lot of good things in your life right now. Happiness is within ourselves anyway. It is not outside of us.

You don’t know what is in the mind of the neighbours. They were stressed about what happened the same way as you did. That’s a fact. You saw it from their tears. You saw it from their anger. Their lives has not been the same after what happened.

There are some evidence that after what happened they are trying to minimise the chance of things getting worse again. They may or may not do bad things. But you don’t know that. That is irrational and is lacking of evidence. It’s unintelligent of you to predict the future and read their minds.

Disqualifying the Positive

Jumping to Conclusions (Mind Reading)

Emotional Reasoning

I don’t know 100% what’s happening inside her brain. I have to remember that according to her, Sandee was good until she and Eric worked together. She also suffered during that time. That’s a fact. And maybe, somehow, because of that suffering, she brought with her a tendency to defend her interests before that of others.

But she does not think of herself ONLY. She does think of me and our team EVERY TIME we work. She might act defensive SOMETIMES. But not ALL THE TIME. She volunteered to train me. She sent materials that could help me understand the work. And she even stated, “I will never leave you like Eric did to me.” That statement is reassuring and sincere.

When I feel I am offended by her actions, it doesn’t mean that she really offended me.

I want to keep things good between the two of us not just for the project but also for both of our EMOTIONAL HEALTH.

Relationship

4. I hurt her with my words and my actions, therefore I am not a good boyfriend. Our relationship is doomed because we had similar problems in the past. Frequent similar problems. She can’t think of anything but herself. All we are doing is trying hard to find common ground. But we are struggling. Because we are very different.

Disqualifying the Positive

Jumping to Conclusions (Mind Reading + Fortune Teller Error)

I can’t predict the future. All I can do is focus on this day. My efforts should focus on trying to fix things today and not delving on what could happen in the future. What happened yesterday or in the past should is not be a viable evidence that this relationship is doomed. We have a lot of good memories and enough evidence that this relationship has worked. We can sit down and talk about our problems. We haven’t done that yet seriously. We ought to do that.

I have to stop reading her mind. It’s wrong to make inferences from her actions. I have to give her the privilege of doubt and instead, ask her what really is in her mind. Then I have to trust what she tells me.

It’s not true that she only thinks of herself. She thinks about me, her family, my family, and other people in her life. All of us think of ourselves to some extent. I know people who are self-conceited. And she is not one of them.

Self-esteem

5. I am nobody. I am an underachiever. After my depression, all my potential to be great is gone. Yes I am living a simple life. But I feel like I am exaggerating it. Because I am afraid of success. I don’t have confidence to go out there and be someone. I feel like my social skills are gone. Ever since I left the church, I got very few chances to talk in front of many people. My public speaking skills are gone. And I am growing old as time passes by. I won’t be the same Vincent who achieved a lot at an early age.

Labeling

Overgeneralization

Disqualifying the Positive

Emotional Reasoning

You are not an underachiever. There is no such thing! Your depression is as valid a challenge as the contests you joined before or the achievements you worked hard to conquer. Treat it as that - a challenge. And when you recover fully - treat it as the best victory you’ve ever had.

Just because you feel that you are exaggerating your desire to live a simple life by limiting yourself to achieve things, doesn’t mean it is true. What is true is that the loss of self-confidence is a symptom typical of Depression and there are ways to battle it.

There is a way to recover from what happened. Thousands of people did it. You can to.

Prioritize. First things first. After your Personal Renaissance, set small goals that build up your confidence to achieve bigger goals. If being popular or known by people is a goal of yours, then pursue it later on.

Focusing on your health does not mean you are limiting yourself. It simply means you know your priorities.

Your social skills and public speaking skills are not gone. They are still there. You are still able to connect with people. And remember that when you went back to school, you did a lot of “connecting” and you met a lot people. The truth is, you can connect with people if you want to. Of course it is a little difficult because of what happened, but by no means are your skills gone! Like any other skill, social skills and public speaking skills develop though practice. Have you practice them yet? If not, then that is a noble goal to pursue next.

Age should not be a measure of being successful. You should have learned that from Depression itself. Juggling a lot of responsibilities and problems caused you a lot of pain and suffering. What you are doing now is being careful, wise, and practical. You choose to live like this because health is your primary value.

It is not too late to achieve things. Many people have proven that even with old age, they can be successful. Come on, you’re just 23! You can still do a lot of things. And you can only do them if you take care of your health, which is what you are doing now, right?

6. Bernice is around and she is not talking, she doesn’t want to talk to me because she is not interested in me, because I am no longer a JW.

Mind Reading

Disqualifying the Positive

Jumping to Conclusions

You are reading her mind. It’s true she doesn’t talk much when you are around but it doesn’t mean she is avoiding you or are not interested to you. You won’t know because you don’t ask her. And even if you ask her, you can’t know what she is thinking exactly on a given time.

The truth is, your sister is shy and always will be. She is fully aware of this. You read her personal notes. Instead of judging her for being this way, emphatize with her. It is difficult to build self-esteem as you are experiencing today. Your sister is in the same situation.

The truth is she is trying her best not to be shy and to talk with you. She smiles at you when she feels good and starts conversations sometimes. You have to appreciate these positive things about her and elevate them rather than judge her based on the times when she doesn’t talk much.

Rather than concluding that she doesn’t want to talk with you or she is avoiding you, you can do the following to improve your relationship with her:

1. Strive hard to talk with her and show that you are interested in her whereabouts.
2. Offer help so she can find a job.
3. Respect her need of privacy.
4. Don’t disturb her.
5. Appreciate her doing more of the housework.
