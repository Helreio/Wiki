Hi, I'm Vince

My personal vision is to live a mindful, playful, and peaceful life that is kind to the earth, to all sentient beings, to the people who inhabit the planet, and most especially, to the Self.

This website is home to the philosophy and life story that embodies this vision.

Hi, I’m Vince Imbat.

I love to ask the big questions, think about them while walking, trying them out in my life, then sharing what I learn through essays, poetry, and photographs in my weekly newsletter.

## Hi, I’m Vince Imbat.

Every day, I try to reflect on the question, “How should I live?” This question brings me to a lot of places. I write about this personal odyssey. I’m still unsure where this will lead me, but I am hoping to deepen my understanding and experience of the world and my place in it.

Hi there. I’m Vince Imbat. This website is the home of my life’s work. The central question I try to answer in my work is, “How should I live?” To answer that question, I study a wide variety of disciplines. Whatever I learn, I apply in my everyday life. I then report my findings on this website.

I study Ginhawa, or the Filipino concept of well-being, and its application to self and society.

Hi, I’m Vince Imbat.

I’m an author, contemplative, and activist. I write about the pursuit of a good life through the interconnections of science, spirituality, and social change in the context of Filipino culture.

I study a wide variety of fields - science, philosophy, art, and literature - and employ different methods of knowing to uncover specific ways in  which we can be better in the things that really matter - compassion, mindfulness, and health. Whatever I learn, I share in my email newsletter.

I don’t have all the answers and I myself am also a work in progress, but I’m happy to share what I’ve learned so far. Here is my full story. (—> link to [vinceimbat.com/about](http://vinceimbat.com/about))
