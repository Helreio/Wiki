# Coding as escape from difficult social situations - Ullman

“Until I became a programmer, I didn’t thoroughly understand the usefulness of such isolation: the silence, the reduction of life to thought and form; for example, going off to a dark room to work on a program when relations with people get difficult.”

Ellen Ullman, Life in Code: A Personal History of Technology
