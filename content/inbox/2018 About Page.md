What will I believe in?

How do I live according to my beliefs?

What kind of world do I want to see and how do I create it?

These three questions guide me and they represent the three crucial parts of my mission:

a search for truth

a personal transition towards a better way of living, and

an active participation in advocating that way of life

These three parts can be encapsulated in a single question:

“How should I live?”

I recognize that answering this question is an individual pursuit. There are as many ways of living life as there are people. Therefore, I try to view my work as a personal mission: a self-directed learning project that aspires to uncover my very own worldview.

How It All Started: My Story

In my past life, I was groomed as a young pastor. But a tragedy came to me in March 2011 which completely changed my life. At age 19, I was diagnosed with severe depression which later on evolved into dysthymia, a less severe but chronic and persistent form of depression. My condition forced me to stop schooling as I was about to begin my last year in college at that time.

It was a very painful experience, one that made me leave my former religion, loose faith in God, and reject all forms of spirituality. Along the way, I also lost most of my friends, but most devastatingly, I lost meaning and purpose in life.

After a year of struggling to live with my condition, something changed within me which motivated me to live again. So, I went back to school, finished my degree, and helped a community of people with disabilities organize themselves.

After graduation, I deviated from conventional work and started a freelance writing and editing practice. I purposefully chose this path so that I could dedicate more time to my recovery. As I did so, I also embraced a creative and multifaceted life grounded in my desire for freedom, vibrance, and contribution.

Slowly, I began to feel a sense of purpose and connection to the world around me again. And as I learned mindfulness practices like meditation and yoga, I built a more intimate relationship with my mind and body.

Perhaps more importantly, the experience helped me realize that what I once called "spirituality" has a more down-to-earth variant—a variant that whilst more humble and ordinary, is far deeper than my earlier ideas about organized religion.

I was convinced that what I once called "spirituality" is simply how I live my life in accordance to how I perceive the reality behind the universe.

But this realization posed new challenges. What is real in the universe? How do I perceive it? How can I be sure that what I perceive is true? And from what I perceive, how do I translate them into a practical guide to living what seems to be a meaningless life?

These questions brought me inevitably into my mission.

The Mission

Today, my work constitutes answering the most fundamental questions of life, aligning my life with what I learn, and sharing the lessons I've learned to everyone who might find them useful.

I am not yet ready to call myself an independent scholar, but I have been pursuing knowledge for quite some time now. I am not yet ready to call myself a farmer, but I have volunteered in a permaculture community and I grow a few vegetables of my own. I am not yet ready to call myself a teacher, but I have written about my beliefs and talked about them to quite a few people who told me I helped them.

I think, research, and write about what constitutes a “good life” in the context of living in the Philippines. I study a wide variety of fields to uncover specific truths about how we can be better in the things that really matter to us as essential parts of the web of life.

Studying is only one part of my mission. Whatever I learn, I apply to my life to see its practicality. Then, I document experiences and share them here in this website. I don’t intend to convince anyone of anything. I write primarily to make more sense of the world around me.
