## Agreeableness: Moderately Low

**You are moderately low in agreeableness, which is the primary dimension of Interpersonal interaction** in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Agreeableness has two aspects: compassion and politeness, which will be explained separately. Agreeableness is a very complex trait, with marked positive and negative elements all along its distribution. Because of this, higher scores and lower scores need to be explained at the same time.

People high in agreeableness are nice: compliant, nurturing, kind, naively trusting and conciliatory. However, because of their tendency to avoid conflict, they often dissemble and hide what they think. **People low in agreeableness are not so nice: stubborn, dominant, harsh, ::skeptical::, competitive and, in the extreme, even predatory. However, they tend to be straightforward, even blunt, so you know where they stand.**

Your score puts you at the **35th** percentile for agreeableness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less agreeable than **64** of them and more agreeable than **35** of them.

![Aggreeableness.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DE7F2838-C07C-4217-8B36-E2517051F061/66D0E7DC-F13A-454B-8D67-EF0DAA1A8347_2)

People with moderately low levels of agreeableness are seen by others as somewhat **competitive, colder and less empathic**. They are **less likely to look for the best in others**, and are **not particularly tolerant** (an attitude that is much valued by agreeable people). They are **less concerned about the emotional state of others**, **willing to engage in conflict**, and **will sacrifice peace and harmony to make a point or (if conscientious) to get things done**. People find them **straightforward, even blunt**. They **tend towards dominance, rather than submission (particularly if also below average in neuroticism)**.

People with moderately low levels of agreeableness are **not particularly forgiving, accepting, flexible, gentle or patient**. They **don’t easily feel pity for those who are excluded, punished or defeated**. They are also **not easily taken advantage of** by disagreeable, manipulative or otherwise troublesome people, or by those with criminal or predatory intent. **Their skepticism plays a protective role, although it may interfere with their ability to cooperate with or trust others whose intentions are genuinely good.** They can **appreciate cooperation, but like competition**, with its clear losers and winners. They **will not easily lose arguments (or avoid discussions) with less agreeable people**. They **tend to be good at bargaining for themselves, or at negotiating for more recognition or power**. They are likely to have higher salaries and to earn more money, in consequence. They are therefore **less likely to suffer from resentment or to harbour invisible anger, although this tendency may be increased, if they are very high in neuroticism**. In addition, **because of their tendency to engage in conflict, when necessary, moderately disagreeable people tend not to sacrifice medium- to long-term stability and function for the sake of short-term peace. This means that problems that should be solved in the present are often solved, and do not accumulate counterproductively across time.**

**Women are higher in agreeableness than men.** The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 61.5. For men it is 38.5. The fact that men are lower in agreeableness than women helps explain their much higher rates of criminal incarceration (90% male). The primary difference between criminals and non-criminals is disagreeableness. If the typical criminal is more disagreeable than 98% of people in the general population, then almost all those criminals will be male. This difference in agreeableness between men and women is largest in countries such as Norway and Sweden, where the most has been done to ensure equality of outcome between the sexes. This provides strong evidence that **biological factors rather than environment and learning account for the dissimilarity.**

Agreeableness, per se, is not strongly associated with political liberalism or conservatism, but this is because the aspects of agreeableness predict such political belief in opposite ways, and cancel each other out. Liberals are higher in aspect compassion, and conservatives in aspect politeness. However, alliance with the category of belief that has come to be known as politically correct is strongly predicted by agreeableness (particularly compassion). What this appears to mean is that **agreeable people strongly identify with those they deem oppressed, seeing them, essentially, as exploited infants, and demonize those they see as oppressors, seeing them as cruel, heartless predators.**

There are large differences between men and women in terms of spontaneous interest, and these also appear associated with agreeableness. Agreeable people, caring as they do for others, are more likely to enter professions associated with people, such as teaching and nursing, which are dominated by women. This is true even in the Scandinavian countries, where attempts to produce gender-equal societies has reached a maximum. **::Disagreeable people, by contrast, appear to prefer systematizing over empathizing, and are more interested in things – machines and technology::.** In consequence, professions such as engineering and trades associated with construction and machinery tend to be dominated by relatively disagreeable men.

Agreeableness has two aspects: compassion and politeness.

### Compassion: Moderately Low

**You are moderately low in compassion**, which is one aspect of Agreeableness. Your score puts you at the **25th** percentile for compassion. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less compassionate than **74** of them and more compassionate than **25** of them.

Less compassionate people are **::not primarily oriented towards the problems of other people or other living things::**. They are less swayed by cuteness. They are **willing to make other people experience negative emotion by engaging in conflict and competition**. They **like to win**, and are ::**less concerned about helping other people**. **They make sure their own needs and interests are attended to**::, and are **::less likely to sacrifice for the sake of other people::**. This can make them appear harsh and unsympathetic. **::People might turn to them for the truth, but not for a soft, patient, eternally-listening ear::.** They are not markedly empathetic and caring. However, because they are not primarily other-oriented, they can often negotiate effectively on their own behalf, and are likely to get at least what they deserve (for their hard work, for example). In consequence, they are unlikely to harbor feelings of resentment or hidden anger.

![Compassion.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DE7F2838-C07C-4217-8B36-E2517051F061/3CC0F427-F789-4D67-AA73-54CC046756F6_2)

Those who are liberal, politically, score somewhat higher in compassion than conservatives.

Women are also higher in compassion than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 61. For men it is 39.

### Politeness: Typical or Average

**You are typical or average in politeness**, which is one aspect of Agreeableness. Your score puts you at the **52nd** percentile for politeness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more polite than **52** of them and less polite than **47** of them.

Typically polite people can be **::deferential to authority, but can also be challenging, when necessary::**. They are **::not particularly obedient::**. They **can be respectful, but will also push back if pushed**. They are **not made uncomfortable by the necessity of standing up to other people**. Typically polite people **::will avoid conflict, reasonably, but are not completely averse to confrontation::**.

![Politeness.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DE7F2838-C07C-4217-8B36-E2517051F061/1C6FF701-E4B4-4145-BE08-D3809043DE1A_2)

Those who are liberal, politically, score somewhat lower in politeness than conservatives (the opposite pattern is seen with compassion).

Women are higher in politeness than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 59. For men it is 41.

## Conscientiousness: Typical or Average

**You are typical or average in conscientiousness, which is the primary dimension of dutiful achievement** in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Conscientiousness is a measure of obligation, attention to detail, hard work, persistence, cleanliness, efficiency and adherence to rules, standards and processes. Conscientious people implement their plans and establish and maintain order.

Your score puts you at the **49th** percentile for conscientiousness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more conscientious than **49** of them and less conscientious than **50** of them.

People of average conscientious levels **generally do their duty, although they are not sloggers**. They are **reliable, but waste some of their time and have some proclivity to procrastinate (particularly if they are also above average in neuroticism)**. Most of the time, however, a person of average conscientiousness **will deliver what he or she promises, and usually close to or on time and schedule**. They are **reasonably decisive, neat, organized, future-oriented, and reliable**. They **can maintain focus, but have some trouble fighting off distraction**.

![Conscientiousness.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DE7F2838-C07C-4217-8B36-E2517051F061/7D4AD5E4-423F-4222-AD06-02B2F714C04E_2)

Typically conscientious people tend to obtain more moderate grades in academic settings (unless they are also highly intelligent). They make reasonably competent administrators and managers. Their performance in such situations would be improved by more diligence and focus, and through the use of careful scheduling. They **::mildly prefer to have everything in its proper place, but are by no means obsessed with detail::**.

Typically conscientious people are **::not particularly prone to guilt:: (although they may let things slide to the point where they have something to feel guilty about)**, and they are **relatively free of shame, self-disgust and self-contempt**.

Individuals who are typically conscientious **do not react too negatively to failure**. They **can let themselves off the hook**, and **tend not to be too judgmental about their own faults, or those of others**. They will suffer some shame and guilt when unemployed or otherwise unoccupied, particularly when that occurs through no fault of their own. People of average conscientiousness are **::reasonably committed to personal responsibility, but also believe that there is more to life than diligence, orderliness and duty::**. They **think that those who work hard should and usually will be rewarded, but also note that luck and chance play their role**. They are **::not excessively preoccupied with hygiene, moral purity or achievement::**, and are **unlikely to be micro-managers or over-controlling**.

People with typical levels of conscientiousness are no more likely to be political conservatives or liberals (although they will tilt towards the former if low in openness and the latter if high).

Women are very slightly more conscientious than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 51.5. For men it is 49.5.

Conscientiousness has two aspects: industriousness and orderliness.

### Industriousness: Typical or Average

**You are typical or average in industriousness**, which is one aspect of conscientiousness. Your score puts you at the **44th** percentile for industriousness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more industrious than **44** of them and less industrious than **55** of them.

People of average industriousness are somewhat likely to be successful in school and in administrative and managerial positions (particularly if they are intelligent). They **do not live to work**, however, and **::do not always have to be doing something useful::**. They **::like their leisure time::**. Typically, they **will do their duty, but they can put things off, and sometimes mess them up**. Usually, but not always, **they finish what they start, and they do it more or less on schedule, with some exceptions**. They are **no more concerned than average with efficiency or savings**. They **can focus on the task on hand, when there are high levels of motivation or pressure, but often find themselves distracted by something more entertaining, or interesting, or worrisome**.

![Industriousness.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DE7F2838-C07C-4217-8B36-E2517051F061/C35382D9-EF25-45FD-AF6E-22509E8DB435_2)

People of average industriousness are **::not particularly judgemental to themselves or others::. They like to live and let live.** They are **somewhat likely to believe that people fail because they don’t apply themselves or work hard enough, but know that other considerations play a role.** They **tend to feel guilty, but not to an overwhelming degree, if they do not do their duty.** They can, however, **find themselves in a guilty position because they failed to perform a task on time or properly.**

Those who are liberal and those who are conservatives appear equally industrious.

Men are slightly more industrious than women. The mean percentile for men in a general population (women and men) is 51.5. For women it is 49.5.

### Orderliness: Typical or Average

**You are average or typical in orderliness**, which is one aspect of conscientiousness. Your score puts you at the **54th** percentile for orderliness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more orderly than **54** of them and less orderly than **45** of them.

Typically orderly people are **neither particularly disturbed nor disgusted by mess and chaos**. They **keep everything moderately tidy and organized**. They **::don’t think in terms of simple black and white; in their world, there are many shades of grey::**. They **don’t rely overmuch on schedules, lists or routines, preferring to take things as they come**. They are **not overly oriented toward detail, rigidly rule-abiding or judgemental**.

![Orderliness.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DE7F2838-C07C-4217-8B36-E2517051F061/F31FED9E-8F5D-4C56-B61E-7281B088388E_2)

They **::like routine and predictability, under some circumstances, but don’t mind if such things are disrupted::**. They **can manage complex, sensitive processes** when supervised properly and carefully, but **may have to be reminded to pay proper attention and maintain focus**. They **can, however, ::tolerate the mess, disruption and intervening periods of chaos that may accompany creative endeavor::**.

Those who are average in orderliness are no more likely to be political conservatives or liberals, although they will tend toward the former, if low in openness to experience and the latter if high.

Women are more orderly than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 54.5. For men it is 45.5. This may account for some of the trouble in relation to housework between women and men. Since women are, on average, more orderly, household disorder will trigger disgust and discomfort in them faster. This may happen with sufficient frequency so they end up doing a disproportionate share of such work (even though if they waited a bit longer their less orderly partners, often men, might end up equally troubled and motivated to fix the problem). Orderly people are more likely to have items such as event calendars, drawer organizers, laundry baskets, irons and ironing boards in their immediate environments.

## Extraversion: Low

**You are low in extraversion, which is the primary dimension of positive emotion** in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. You could also think of yourself as **high in introversion**. **Extraversion is a measure of general sensitivity to positive emotions such as hope, joy, anticipation and approach, particularly in social situations**.

Your score puts you at the **12th** percentile for extraversion. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less extraverted than **87** of them and more extraverted than **12** of them.

People with low levels of extraversion are **much less enthusiastic, talkative, assertive in social situations, or gregarious**. They **find social contact somewhat draining and tiring**, and **crave time alone to recharge**. They are much less likely to plan parties, tell jokes, make people laugh, or volunteer for community activities. They are **more likely to be depressed and to have lower levels of self-esteem (particularly if they are high in neuroticism)**. They tend to be **much less optimistic about the past, present and future**.

![Extraversion.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DE7F2838-C07C-4217-8B36-E2517051F061/AF435D4A-6D2C-4606-8CBB-6C52A05ED509_2)

People who are low in extraversion **::find it easy to keep things to themselves::**. They are **by no means compelled to share everything with everyone**. They are **not self-disclosing and do not warm up quickly to other people**. They are **::much more comfortable with one-to-one interactions than in a group-oriented situation::**. They **rarely speak up in meetings**, and are **particularly unlikely to speak first, although they will express an opinion if asked**. They are **::much less likely to captivate and convince, especially in groups::**, and **will rarely be the first to act in an ambiguous situation**.

People who are low in extraversion are **much better suited to occupations that require work alone or with a few other well-known individuals** (such as computer programming or accounting). **::Jobs involving sales, persuasion, work in groups and public speaking are quite unlikely to appeal to them, and they are less likely to be successful at such things (particularly if they are also high in neuroticism).::**

People low in extraversion are **::unlikely to be impulsive, even when offered the opportunity to do something exciting or fun::**. They are therefore **unlikely to sacrifice the future to the present, when something social or group-oriented beckons**. They **find it relatively ::easy to be alone to study and work::**. They are **not easily distracted by opportunities to chat, joke and socialize**. **This is particularly the case if they are also high in conscientiousness.** However, **when people are introverted and conscientious, they are less productive than when extraverted and conscientious, perhaps because they have lower levels of energy**. **When introverted and comparatively unconscientiousness, however, they are more productive than when extraverted and unconscientious.**

People low in extraversion are ::**less dominant in social situations, particularly when they are also low in agreeableness**.:: **::Less agreeable extraverts tend to be self-centered – something that can be made worse if they are also low in conscientiousness. More introverted people are somewhat protected against such tendencies.::**

Those who are politically liberal are slightly less extraverted than conservatives.

Women are slightly more extraverted than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 52. For men it is 48.

Extraversion has two aspects: Enthusiasm and Assertiveness.

### Enthusiasm: Very Low

**You are very low in enthusiasm**, which is one aspect of extraversion. Your score puts you at the **6th** percentile for enthusiasm. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less enthusiastic than **93** of them and more enthusiastic than **6** of them.

Individuals who are very low in enthusiasm are **quiet and un-excitable**. They ::**can be very hard to get to know, as they are not at all chatty or bubbly**.:: **::When they do talk – and they do so comparatively rarely – it tends to be about things in which they find exceptional interest.::** They **open up to other people with difficulty, particularly in larger social gatherings or parties**. They laugh very much less frequently than others. They **typically prefer solitude** and **find it difficult to enjoy themselves around other people**. At most, they **::can handle social contact in small doses::.** They are **private people, on the loner side of the distribution, and tend not to be positive or optimistic**. They ::**actively avoid the spotlight**:: and, **if creative, may find performing very much less desirable, even draining**. They **::very rarely seek out stimulation, excitement, activity or fun (and, if they do so, much prefer quieter activities)::**. People very low in enthusiasm are **solitary, finding it uncommonly difficult to generate a felt sense of excitement when offered the opportunity to engage in something that others might find engaging or entertaining**.

![Enthusiasm.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DE7F2838-C07C-4217-8B36-E2517051F061/486CD847-4050-4A31-A67D-3B8DA21B9B9C_2)

Enthusiasm is not strongly associated with political preference, either conservative or liberal.

Women are higher in enthusiasm than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 55. For men it is 45.

### Assertiveness: Moderately Low

**You are moderately low in assertiveness**, which is one aspect of extraversion. Your score puts you at the **31st** percentile for assertiveness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less assertive than **68** of them and more assertive than **31** of them.

Somewhat less assertive people are **not known to be “take charge” types**. They **put their own opinions forward with reservation**, and **rarely attempt to dominate and control social situations**. Somewhat less assertive people are **generally not influential or captivating in social groups**. They have ::**less of the communication style that is often associated with leadership**. **This can be somewhat of a handicap when they are knowledgeable, competent and able, but causes less trouble when they aren’t.**:: Those moderately low in assertiveness are **less likely to be people of action**. They rarely in heedlessly and, in consequence, **tend to allow others to lead the way**. They are **not typically impulsive**, in consequence, and **rarely act without thinking**.

![Assertiveness.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DE7F2838-C07C-4217-8B36-E2517051F061/00C4A0EF-3B46-412D-823E-7EA091686496_2)

Liberals tend to be slightly less assertive than conservatives.

Women are slightly less assertive than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 48. For men it is 52.

## Neuroticism: Typical or Average

**You have typical levels of neuroticism, which is the primary dimension of negative emotion** in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. **Neuroticism is a measure of general sensitivity to negative emotions such as pain, sadness, irritable or defensive anger, fear and anxiety.**

Your score puts you at the **56th** percentile for neuroticism. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in neuroticism than **56** of them and lower in neuroticism than **43** of them.

People with typical or average levels of neuroticism have a **balanced view of the happiness and sadness of the past, present and future**. **::Sometimes they are unhappy, anxious and irritable, particularly when facing a genuine problem, but they generally cope well and don’t worry too much::**.

![Neuroticism.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DE7F2838-C07C-4217-8B36-E2517051F061/B88D9B99-63AD-4687-A85E-C71384A17FD2_2)

They have normal levels of self-esteem, particularly when they are also average or above average in extraversion. They are not **particularly at risk for developing anxiety disorders and depression**.

People with average or typical levels of neuroticism are **able to experience the consequences of success and to be appropriately satisfied in relationships and career**. Average levels of neuroticism are **associated with no more than average concern about mental and physical health**, a typical number of physician and emergency room visits, and an expected degree of absenteeism at work and at school (unless accompanied by very low levels of conscientiousness).

People with average levels of neuroticism **appear to neither seek risk out, nor avoid it**. They are **interested in security, but can also handle recreational, career, financial and social situations where the possibility of loss is higher**. Such people **::appear to be concerned both with maintaining their current status, as well as enhancing it. This is a reasonable strategy in genuinely dangerous or uncertain times and better times alike.::**

Neuroticism is not a powerful predictor of political belief, either conservative or liberal.

Females tend to be higher in neuroticism than males. The typical woman is higher in neuroticism than 60% of the general population of men and women combined. In part, this may be why women report more unhappiness in their relationships, at work, in school and with their health than men, on average, and why women initiate 70% of all divorces. This difference in neuroticism between men and women appears to emerge at puberty. It is largest in countries such as Norway and Sweden, where the most has been done to ensure equality of outcome between the sexes. This provides strong evidence that biological factors rather than environment and learning account for the dissimilarity.

Trait neuroticism is made up of the aspects withdrawal and volatility.

### Withdrawal: Typical or Average

**You are typical or average in withdrawal**, which is one aspect of neuroticism. Your score puts you at the **57th** percentile for withdrawal. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in withdrawal than **57** of them and lower in withdrawal than **42** of them.

Individuals average in withdrawal **::may occasionally suffer from anticipatory anxiety, but are generally not impeded by it::**. They **::can handle new, uncertain, unexpected, threatening or complex situations quite well::.** They are **not more likely to avoid or withdraw in the face of the unknown and unexpected.**

People with average levels of withdrawal **::sometimes feel sad, lonesome, disappointed and grief-stricken, but not too deeply, and not for too long.::** They **experience normal levels of doubt and worry, embarrassment, self-consciousness and discouragement in the face of threat and punishment.** They are **reasonably but not excessively sensitive to social rejection, and don’t feel hurt too easily.** **Even when hurt, frightened, or anxious, they can recover in a reasonable amount of time.** People with typical levels of withdrawal are **not particularly concerned that something bad is going to happen.** Technically, withdrawal has been associated with activity in the brain systems that regulate passive avoidance.

![Withdrawal.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DE7F2838-C07C-4217-8B36-E2517051F061/F67ED030-1307-47F9-8209-E3BC0DD2402E_2)

Those who are liberal, politically, are slightly higher in withdrawal than conservatives.

Women are higher in withdrawal than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 60. For men it is 40.

### Volatility: Typical or Average

**You are typical or average in volatility**, which is one aspect of neuroticism. Your puts you at the **53rd** percentile for volatility. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more volatile than **53** of them and less volatile than **46** of them.

Individuals average in volatility **tend to not to vary abnormally in their mood**. They are **not particularly irritable, and feel no more than typical levels of disappointment, frustration, pain and social isolation**. They **express their frustration, disappointment and irritability reasonably and not excessively often**. **Even when stirred up and upset or angry or irritated, they calm down relatively quickly.** They are **no more argumentative than average and infrequently lose their composure.**

**If provoked in a dispute, a person of average volatility may react in kind (particularly if also low in agreeableness).** However, **such people generally remain calm and unperturbed, even when stressed.** Volatile people tend to get upset if something bad does happen, while people high in withdrawal (the other aspect of neuroticism) tend to be concerned that something bad might happen. Technically, volatility has been associated with activity in the brain systems that regulate fight, flight or freeze.

![Volatility.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DE7F2838-C07C-4217-8B36-E2517051F061/F1C3C7EE-0997-40DC-A049-B62E50A3BAC5_2)

Volatility is not strongly related to political preference, either liberal or conservative.

Women are higher in volatility than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 57.5. For men it is 42.5.

## Openness to Experience: Moderately High

**You are moderately high in openness to experience, which is the primary dimension of creativity, artistic interest and intelligence (particularly verbal intelligence)** in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. **Openness to experience is a measure of interest in novelty, art, literature, abstract thinking, philosophy as well as sensitivity to aesthetic emotions and beauty.**

Your score puts you at the **64th** percentile for openness to experience. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in openness to experience than **64** of them and lower in openness to experience than **35** of them.

People with moderately high levels of openness to experience are **somewhat more likely than average to be characterized by others as smart, creative, exploratory, intelligent and visionary.** They **tend to be more interested in learning and in acquiring new abilities and skills**. They are **curious and exploratory**. They **find themselves interested in abstract thinking, philosophy, and the meaning of belief systems and ideologies.** They **attend cultural events such as movies, concerts, dance recitals, plays, poetry readings, gallery openings and art shows.** They are **likely to enjoy writing**. They **enjoy complex, abstract ideas more than the average person, and like to confront and solve problems.**

![Openness to Experience.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DE7F2838-C07C-4217-8B36-E2517051F061/30ADE039-61F2-418D-B5CC-ED5A7A7863C3_2)

They are **likely to be readers, with a wider range of interests.** They have a **broader and deeper vocabulary**. They can **think and learn quite quickly**. They are **comparatively proficient at formulating new ideas, and tend to be articulate (particularly if average or above in extraversion)**. People moderately high in openness **can sometimes see old things in new ways.** They can **formulate problems in a diverse range of ways**, and **can typically generate a reasonable number of problem-solving solutions**. They **enjoy change, often to make things better, but also just for the sake of change.**

People who are moderately high in openness to experience are **::somewhat less well adapted to situations or occupations that are routinized and predictable::**. They **have some** ::**trouble fitting in at the bottom of hierarchies**.:: They are **::less suited to entry-level, repetitive, rote positions::, because they often think up new ways to do things, and such ideas are seldom welcome from someone at the bottom**. They are **creative thinkers**. They **tend to shake things up a bit, particularly if they are also disagreeable and assertive**, and **may be attracted to more revolutionary ideas** (particularly if below average in conscientiousness).

Individuals moderately high in openness to experience **tend to be entrepreneurial in spirit, as well as smarter and more creative**. They **have more than average interest in creating new ventures, sometimes for profit, sometimes for curiosity, and sometimes for personal transformation**. At least moderately high levels of openness to experience appear necessary to the formation and leadership of business and other forms of complex organization, although conscientiousness appears required for the attention to detail and process management that such organizations also always need.

**::People moderately high in openness to experience tend to be interested in many things. However, they can still typically settle on a single path in life, to specialize to a necessary degree, and to create an integrated identity (unless they are very high or above in neuroticism and/or very low or below in conscientiousness).::** People characterized by the combination of moderately high openness to experience and very high or above levels of neuroticism can undermine their own convictions and beliefs by questioning and making themselves lost and anxious. Open, unconscientious people tend to be “under-achievers” (particularly if also above average in neuroticism). Such people appear to have the capability to succeed, can learn quickly, and are creative, but they can have some trouble implementing their ideas.

Openness to experience is the dimension that best predicts political allegiance (with conscientiousness, particularly the aspect of orderliness, coming in at second place). Those who are liberal, politically, are very much more likely to be high in openness to experience than conservatives.

Women and men differ very little in openness to experience at the trait level, although there are differences in the aspect levels.

Trait openness to experience is made up of the aspects of intellect and openness.

### Intellect: Moderately Low

Note: **Do not confuse the personality aspect of Intellect with IQ. Intellect is a measure of interest in abstract ideas, essentially, while IQ is a measure of processing speed, verbal ability, working memory, and problem solving capacity, and is better measured with a formal IQ test. It is perfectly possible to have a high IQ and a low score on the personality trait of Intellect.**

You are moderately low in intellect, which is one aspect of openness to experience. Your score puts you at the **28th** percentile for intellect. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in intellect than **71** of them and higher in intellect than **28** of them.

People moderately low in intellect **are less likely to evince interest in ideas and abstract concepts.** They **tend not to appreciate learning about philosophical ideas.** **::They don’t want to be overloaded with information::, particularly if it is complex.** They are **less intellectually curious**, and will **rarely voluntarily tackle and solve complex abstract problems.** They are **less likely to engage in issue-oriented discussions, or to enjoy idea-centered books**. They can **be ::somewhat less articulate (particularly if average or lower in extraversion) and may have some difficulty formulating and communicating their ideas::.** People moderately low in intellect may **have a vocabulary of somewhat less than normal breadth and depth,** and **like to stick with the tried-and-true, rather than learning new ideas and skills**. They will be **less likely to seek out or generate novel, creative concepts or finding and adapting to new experiences and situations.**

People moderately low in intellect **find complex, rapidly changing occupations less to their liking** and are **less likely to do well at them (unless high in conscientiousness and low in neuroticism)**. They are better suited to stable, straightforward and more traditional occupations, where the rules for success are well-defined and tend not to change.

Liberals are higher in intellect than conservatives (although the biggest difference between the two is openness to experience at the trait level).

Women are lower than men in intellect (although not in IQ). This is probably a difference in interest: people high in intellect, compared to openness, are more likely to prefer the sciences to the arts. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 45. For men it is 55.

### Openness: High

**You are high in openness**, which is one aspect of openness to experience. Your score puts you at the **87th** percentile for openness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in openness than **87** of them and lower in openness than **12** of them.

**The closest synonym for openness (rather than openness to experience, which encompasses openness and intellect) is ::creativity::.** Highly open, creative people **::love beauty::**. They **need an outlet for their creative ability, or they have difficulty thriving**. They **::want to be surrounded by art:: or beautiful crafts**. They are **::sensitive to color and architectural form::**. They **like to collect things**. They are **::imaginative::, and like to daydream and ::reflect on things::**. They are **::affected comparatively deeply by music, often of many genres, and may be musical or artistic themselves::** (both of these are rare in the general population). They **::can get thoroughly immersed in a book, or a movie, or in their own thoughts, and become somewhat oblivious to the outside world. They respond strongly to beauty, creativity and art.::**

Highly open, creative people **can be impractical and flighty**, however (particularly if low in conscientiousness). It can be extremely difficult to transform creativity into money, or into a career. **High levels of openness are, furthermore, necessary for entrepreneurial success, and often prove useful at the top of hierarchies, even in very conservative occupations** such as banking, accounting and law, which need creative people in leadership positions to provide new vision and direction.

Liberals are higher in openness than conservatives (although the biggest difference between the two is openness to experience, at the trait level).

Women are higher in openness than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 56.5. For men it is 44.5.
