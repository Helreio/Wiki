# Running Lean

# Meta-Principles

Running Lean = Right action. Right time.

Listening to customers is important but you have to know how to do it.

**3 Steps to Running Lean**

1. Document your Plan A.
2. Identify the riskiest parts of your plan.
3. Systematically test your plan.

Write down your initial vision then share it to at least one person.

Your product is not the product. The business model is the product.

Tackle the riskiest parts first.

The bigger risk for most startups is building something nobody wants.

**3 Stages of a Startup**

1. Problem/Solution Fit
2. Problem/Market Fit
3. Scale

*Problem/Solution Fit*

Key Question: Do I have a problem worth solving?

- Is it something customers want? (must-have)
- Will they pay for it? If not, who will? (viable)
- Can it be solved? (feasible)

Tools to answer:

1. Qualitative customer observation
2. Interviewing techniques

Goal: To derive the minimum feature set to address the right set of problems (MVP)

*Product/Market Fit*

Key Question: Have I built something people want?

- Problem Validation [Done]
- MVP [Done]
- Next step: Test how well your solution solves the problem.

Goal: Achieve Product/Market Fit (traction). Customers are signing up, you are retaining them, and getting paid.

*Scale*

Key Question: How do I accelerate growth?

**Pivot Before Product/Market Fit, Optimise After**

Before Product/Market Fit -> Focus: Learning and pivots.

After Product/Market Fit -> Focus: Growth and optimisations.

Pivot - experiment to validate parts of the business model (course correction).

Optimization - refine the business model (efficiency).

You stand to learn the most when the probability of the expected outcome is 50%; that is when you don’t know what to expect.

Maximise learning by picking bold outcomes rather than incremental improvements.

Don’t get funding before product/market fit.

Bootstrapping + Lean Startup = Low-Burn Startup

**Systematically Test Your Plan**

Conduct a series of experiments.

Experiment = one cycle of the validated learning loop.

**BUILD** -> Product -> **MEASURE** -> Data -> **LEARN** -> Ideas

Build = artifact in front of customers

Measure = qualitative (microscale) + quantitative (macroscale)

Learning = validate or refute hypothesis

**Iteration Meta-Pattern**

Iteration = Multiple experiments together toward achieving a specific goal (getting to product/market fit)

(Problem_Solution Fit) ***UNDERSTAND PROBLEM*** -> ***DEFINE SOLUTION*** -> (Product_Market Fit) **VALIDATE QUALITATIVELY** -> **VERIFY QUANTITATIVELY**

# Create Your Lean Canvas

Be open to exploring multiple models.

Start by brainstorming the possible customers for your product.

## Distinguish between customers and users.
Split broad customer segments into smaller ones.
