# To immediately conclude that there is a god, for me, is premature. But so is dismissing the idea.

What we do know is that there seems to be laws that the universe follows. These laws are discoverable. They were there even before there was man. Man didn't create or conceive of these laws.

Now, laws seem to require a law-giver - a form of intelligence. These laws are not about design, they are simply seemingly given organizing principles that explain the behaviors of entities.

To interpret these laws as the makings of a lawgiver involves leap of faith. I don't have to leap if I can simply say that an intelligence exists in the universe even before I came to it. I don't even have to leap even if I am awed by this intelligence. It is enough for me to be in awe with what is obvious to me and live my life according to that awe.
