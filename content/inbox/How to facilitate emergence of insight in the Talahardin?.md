# How to facilitate emergence of insight in the Talahardin?

[[The purpose of thinking is to produce insight]], and this is where the Talahardin comes in. [[Talahardin facilitates the emergence of insight]]. But when in the Talahardin, what is the general process we follow to produce insight? [[Thinking is asking and responding to questions]].

If this is the case, [[Evergreens]] should be divided into different types that facilitate asking and responding to questions:

1. Concepts or definitions ([[Aspire to write atomic notes but not to the expense of understandability and utility]])
2. Problems: Write problems in the form of questions. These questions should be those you donâ€™t know the answer to. Write why the question is relevant to your thinking.
3. Solutions: There are multiple solutions to one problem. Include assumptions, prediction, wild guesses, hypotheses, or theories.
4. Evidence: Take note of logice and empirical information that support your solutions.

How do you organize these types of permanent notes?

When starting a learning project, you can start with a question. Use this question as the title of the structure note. In this structure note, add links to notes containing solutions and evidences. At the end of the note, add your insights.

To write insights, state your position to the problem. List other problems that emerged, which should trigger more questions, research, learning, and wisdom.

## Example

A simplified example of a structure note:

- Title: How does X influence Z?
- Relevance: This question is relevant because of A, B, and C.
- Solutions:

> [link to Solution 1]

> [Link to Solution 2]

> [Link to Solution 3]

- Evidence:

> [Link to evidence 1]

> [Link to evidence 2]

- Insights:

Based on the available evidence, I believe Solution 1 is the most feasible because W, T, and R. If that is the case, it will also be important to respond to questions B [link to question B], C [link to questions C], and D [link to question D].
