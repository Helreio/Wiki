# Three fundamental hallmarks of philosphical works

According to [[Napoleon Mabaquiao Jr.]], in the strict use of the word philosophy in the academe ([[Strict use of “philosophy”]]), there are three fundamental hallmarks of philosophical works:

1. Topic: [[A philosophical work asks questions about foundations]]
2. Methodology: [[A philosophical work uses methods from philosophical traditions]]
3. Arguments: [[A philosophical work uses argumentation to advance ideas]]

However, I think these [[Three fundamental hallmarks of philosophical works are restricting]].
