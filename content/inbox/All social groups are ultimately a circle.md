# All social groups are ultimately a circle

All social groups are ultimately a circle. But whether there is something in the center of that circle and what it is makes that circle distinct.

If it's a state at the center, it's called a nation.

If it's a guru, it's a cult.

I am less interested about these circles where there is one single individual, group or concept at the middle and more interested about circles where there is no center.
