# Lenient use of “philosophy”

According to [[Napoleon Mabaquiao Jr.]], unlike in the [[Strict use of “philosophy”]], the lenient use of the word “philosophy” becomes a synonym for words like idea, belief, opinion, tip, reason, principle, etc. Here the word [[thoughts/philosophy]] refers to something that may not be “philosophical” in the strict sense.

This simply means that [[Philosophy as belief is different from philosophy as discipline]].
