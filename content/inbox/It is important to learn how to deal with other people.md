# It is important to learn how to deal with other people

To live a good life, it is so important to learn how to deal with other people. We have goals and we want to go after them, but so do other people, and sometimes, our goals intersectâ€”either someone is an obstacle or a support towards getting to what we want. Either way, we need to deal with people.

A wise strategy in life, therefore, is to build and cultivate relationships with people that would:

1. Help you get to what you want easier
2. Not get in your way

That is why conversations are so important to learn. They are the avenues for negotiation, communication, asserting boundaries, and building relationships.

It is easier to ask for help or request for someone to allow us to do what we want to do without hassle, if we have a relationship with that person.
