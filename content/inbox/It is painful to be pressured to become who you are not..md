# It is painful to be pressured to become who you are not.

If years and years of this struggle continues, its accumulated power is enough to change one's brain chemistry and become depressed.

To some extent, I agree with ADB's argument that a relationship is a place where partners or parties could learn from each other and be better.

However, there are elements of a person's personality which could never change or will only change with a lot of pain. It is wise to identify these elements and embrace them instead of changing them. These are the raw materials of a person, they are what we commit to.

This could be said in a couple as well as between parent and child.

For partners, we should learn how to identify these before we commit to the person.

For parents or children, we couldn't commit, we could either disown them or embrace them. If we follow the latter path, we should learn the traits to change and those to let be.
