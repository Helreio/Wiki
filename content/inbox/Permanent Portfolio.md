# Permanent Portfolio

This portfolio was created by [[Harry Browne]] during the 1980s. It was explained in his book Fail-Safe Investing in 2011.

It consists of the following:

- 25% Total US Stock Market
- 25% [[Long-term bonds]]
- 25% Cash
- 25% Gold

This portfolio is very similar to the [[All Weather Portfolio]]. The reason why it is called Permanent Portfolio is because it doesn't need rearrangement.

The four assets correspond to four economic climates:

- Stocks - economic expansion
- Bonds - deflation
- Cash - economic recession
- Gold - inflation
