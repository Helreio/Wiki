# Rationalization does not automatically lead to suffering

A lack of rational thinking also leads to sufferingâ€”perhaps even a large chunk of suffering. It is not true that intuition creates this inescapable magic that suddenly changes the world. The problem of the world should be cured through exploring solutions and using human creativity. Then we work around political structures to lobby for their solutions. There is no magic here. Everyting is understandable. [[Suffering is avoided by seeing things as they are]].

We have both intuitio and reason. We should not reject any. We should get them to work together.
