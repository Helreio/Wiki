# Infopreneur in 5

# *Lesson 1 - Decide what you teach. Decide how you teach.*

**INTRODUCTION**

**Decide what you teach**

Nailing that encompassing idea of what you want to teach -> Content Plan

**Decide how you teach**

There is more to value than just content.

Content is important but there are so many ways to build value than just content.

Layer 1 Building Block for Value = Content

Layer 2 Building Block for Value = Your Voice (personality, tone, the way you present things)

Layer 3 Building Block for Value = Functionality (how does your product function? website, course, ebook, email)

Layer 4 Building Block for Value = Organization (is it arranged in a way that makes sense? lead your reader to the content so it won’t loose value)

Layer 5 Building Block for Value = Presentation (can develop their impression of you)

You have to add value in all of these 5 areas. Not just content.

---

**Step 1: Use the CLARITY worksheet to lay out what you teach, the goal of your brand, and your general categories of content.**

***What do you teach?***

I teach:

- How to live (inner)
- How to help (outer)
- How to live a creative life
- How to establish a career as a light worker
- How to make a living to support oneself in this path to light work (sustenance)

***What is the goal of your brand for you and your life?***

Ultimately, the goal is to:

- Help me and others live according to our most authentic nature, according to the spiritual truths and reality behind the Universe.
- Bring change into a much larger scale through “light work” to help society live in a more natural way of living.

***Why do your topic and teachings matter?***

They matter because truth matters, life matters. And this life is about that. Service through words. Service through teaching the truth and helping others live according to it.

***Who does your content help?***

I call them Sage Types.

People who are:

- Spiritual (sees the oneness and the divine in humanity)
- Service-oriented
- Creative

***What is the goal of your brand for your audience?***

- Help them live consciously and more attuned to the Universe.
- Help them know how to contribute in this Universe.
- Help them tap into the Divine within them through doing any form of creative work.
- Help them establish a career as a light worker.
- Help them support themselves financially so they can continue working in their purpose.

Ultimately, of course, this brand shall help others:

- Live according to our most authentic nature, according to the spiritual truths and reality behind the Universe.
- bring change into a much larger scale through “light work” to help society live in a more natural way of living.

***Can you clearly explain what you do and what you help people with? Try it below:***

I help spiritually-minded, service-oriented and creative individuals live more consciously, contribute to the healing of the world, tap into their most creative and divine selves, and support themselves while pursuing a career that matters.

***What are the categories of content you create under your general topic or niche?***

Conscious Living

Contribution

Creativity

Career

Sustenance

**Step 2: Write down 5 solid product ideas in your teaching area on a notepad or in a document (or on the NOTES sheet in your worksheet set).**

1. PODCAST: A podcast interviewing the key light workers in the Philippines (and maybe across the globe) to help/inspire aspiring light workers live their purpose.
2. COACHING: A one-on-one coaching program that aims to help light workers construct a unique and specific plan of attack to their individual lives.
3. ONLINE COURSE: An online master course that helps light workers tackle the three most important areas of their lives: SUSTENANCE, INNER SERVICE, and OUTER SERVICE.
4. WORKSHOP: A small group workshop on Creativity.
5. A book.

**Step 3: Fill out the CONTENT worksheet with your product ideas. Place them in the row that applies to the category/type of product. Take 10 minutes to fill in as many additional content ideas as possible in their proper rows.**

**Educational Content**

**Opt-in Gifts or Upgrades**

**Video Content**

**Workshops**

**Share-worthy Content**

**Courses**

**Tools**

**Events**

**Other products or content**

Light Workers Podcast

Book

Creativity Workshop

The Life Triangle Online Course

Coaching

**Step 4: Complete the VALUE worksheet with elements/features you like and don’t like about other brands in the five areas of value discussed in the video above.**

# *Lesson 2 - Create a Content Plan. Create an Editorial Plan*

**Step 1: Lay out your levels of content (both free and paid).**

In the download set you'll see a PRODUCT PYRAMID for you to take notes on the ideas and features of each level in the pyramid (explained underneath the image below). You'll also see an EXAMPLE PYRAMID (where I've outlined the products a copywriter might develop) and a worksheet titled PLAN (for you to have space to write your own ideas).

A product pyramid is a graphical way of laying out your overall product vision and grand plan. It's an important step in building a business model because you're able to clearly see how you're monetizing and what content you're using to encourage people to check out your product offerings.

**P.S. Why is This a Pyramid and Not a Funnel?**

I like to draw out your products graphically as a pyramid instead of a funnel because I believe it's a more human representation of the decision people are making to buy from you. People have to consciously decide to spend money and time with you (which is represented by going up a floor/level in the pyramid) and I believe that choice should be honored with great products.

In the funnel mindset, many people present a system that makes it seem like customers are being led mindlessly through a path they have no control over. It's always good to humanize your audience and keep in mind that people are spending hard-earned money with you and deciding to invest in themselves and trust in you.

**The Bottom Layer: Popular Products**

The bottom layer/floor of your pyramid is the "popular" category. This is where people first become aware of your brand. Your popular products should be free, informative, and valuable because they are built for:

- **a beginner audience**
- **or, those with a slight** **interest in your** **topic/skills**
- **or, people feeling out** **your abilities and** **learning to trust** **you**

You can create popular products such as:

- **blog posts**
- **free eBooks**
- **communities**
- **free email courses**
- **Periscopes**
- **Q+As or virtual office hours**
- **webinars or workshops**
- **podcasts**
- **weekly emails**
- **and so much more**

When building out your popular section, ask yourself:

- **What do beginners need to know?**
- **What can I do to be valuable to people at this level?**
- **What will be on par with and/or surpass what other people are doing at this level?**

As you fill in your popular section, give big ideas (like an epic free email course) their own space on the bottom level, but record recurring pieces of content (like your blog posts and weekly emails) as categories. You'll fill out your specific ideas in your content queue--which is Step 2 of today.

**The Middle Layer: Practical Products (or Scalable Products)**

Once people have consumed your popular products and enjoyed them, they may make the decision to move up a layer_floor and consume your "practical" products. They're /practical_ for your audience because they are generally affordable but more detailed than your popular content, and they're *practical* for you because though they take a while to develop, they can be sold to multiple people at once and they don't require a ton of maintenance or supervision. Your practical products are for:

- **people who have consumed your popular stuff and liked their experiences with you**
- **those who have a moderate to high** **level of interest in your topic**
- **those who want to work with you** **personally but can’t afford it yet**
- **people who want more attention** than your popular products provide

You can create scalable and practical products such as:

- **boot camps**
- **group coaching**
- **online classes**
- **eBooks or workbooks**
- **in-person events**
- **subscription services**
- **and so much more**

**The Top Layer: Personal Products**

The final layer of your pyramid, the top portion that takes up the least space, is reserved for one-to-one or one-to-few products that are not scalable but can have high value for the client and high price points for you.

Personal products are for:

- **people with a high sense of urgency for their goals**
- **people who are interactive and auditory learners**
- **people who have consumed your products at other levels and are convinced you are the truth**
- **those who want/need more hand-holding and guidance than they believe your other products provide**

You can develop personal products such as:

- **coaching packages**
- **audits/reports**
- **certain IRL events**
- **freelance work**
- **consultations**
- **and more**

*Hint: Try to really stretch your thinking when you fill out each section. Just because you see it done elsewhere in your niche, doesn't mean you need to pursue it. And on the other side of that, just because you haven't seen it done in your niche (perhaps you've seen it done in other unrelated industries), doesn't mean you can't try it on and see how it fits.*

#### Step 2: Create a content queue.

With all your epic and creative content ideas (both free and paid) in mind, create a content queue with each overall category of content you'll create (emails, Periscopes, office hours, blog posts, podcast episodes, etc.). You probably already started this process in Lesson 1 on the CONTENT worksheet. Now it's time to transfer those lists of content ideas to your Evernote account, your blog planner, your notebook, or a Google spreadsheet--whatever place you want to store your content ideas so that you can pull from them and fill in your editorial calendar.

If you keep your content queue updated each time you have a new idea, then when you're ready to create something new, you can simply go find the applicable type_category of content, and pull the most pressing_exciting piece of content. You'll be able to either create it or pop it into your calendar to create at a later time.

Having a running queue and an active imagination are some of the biggest keys to success for creators of information products. Always keep the wheels turning, and get in the habit of recording ideas as soon as they pop in your head. Even if you're unsure whether you'll pursue them or not, write them down--they may be just what you need later on or they may spark something else that's epic.

**Step 3: Create an editorial plan that starts with a product you want to release in 3 months. Work backward from there.**

Head to the [Calendar Creation](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/d0uzed0d4amu4z2l/x1zvjk/aHR0cDovL2VsMi5jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9jL3ByZXZpZXcveDF6dmprL2FIUjBjRG92TDNkM2R5NTBhVzFsWVc1a1pHRjBaUzVqYjIwdlkyRnNaVzVrWVhJdlkzSmxZWFJsTG1oMGJXdz0=) portion of *Time and Date* to create a rough draft calendar for the next 3 months. You'll be able to select your date range and then print calendars for the months you select. *Psst:* You can optionally do 6 months or more, but the exercise below is for 3 months.

1. Pick a date about 3 months away on which you'll release one of your "practical" or "scalable" information products. **Write down your product release on your chosen day.** *We will learn more about creating certain types of products during this course, but pick whichever product you think makes the most sense for your business goals.*
2. **Select the content ideas from your content queue** (from all the different types of content you plan to create--emails, blog posts, Periscopes, etc.) **that most relate to the product you're releasing in 3 months.** These can either be "lead-in pieces" that help to guide people toward your product or they can be "building pieces" that help you actually create and test portions of the product (ex: part of a chapter of a book, a tutorial video that will later be a part of a class, etc.).
3. **Calculate how many pieces of each type of content you will need to fill in your editorial calendar** from now until your product release date by multiplying how often you plan to post each type of content (ex: weekly emails, twice-a-week blog posts) by the number of weeks on your calendar.
4. **Dedicate 1/4 to 1/3 of the slots** you calculated **to your content ideas from No. 2 above**.
5. **Spread out your content ideas related to your product evenly over the next three months**, leaving a few more pieces for the end when you'll be promoting and launching your product.
6. **Fill in the remaining 2/3 or 3/4 of content slots with content that varies from the topic of your upcoming product release** (so that people won't forget the other topics you talk about). Make sure these are all dispersed throughout your editorial plan so that your audience doesn't get overwhelmed with only one aspect of one topic.
7. When the time comes and your product is released, **don't forget to go back to previously published content and link to the sales page of your product** where you can.

# *Lesson 3 - Create Books on Books on Books*

Okay--Day 3. How ya feeling so far? Instead of traditional "steps" with worksheets today, we have more of a lesson, but presented in the ideal order you might want to complete things in. I guess, that's kinda like steps, huh? Whatever. Don't judge me.

*Let's get started.* We'll be talking about creating different types of books and the process of publishing them yourself, so it's a semi-intense lesson. You may want to start with the introductory chapter from my book ( **Zero to Self-Published Book** ) that's coming out next month. [Here it is for free.](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/e5udp0903t0up9dr/l178yv/aHR0cDovL2VsMi5jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9jL3ByZXZpZXcvbDE3OHl2L2FIUjBjRG92TDJKNWNtVm5hVzVoTG1OdmJTOWliMjlyTFdOb1lYQjBaWEl0YjI1bA==)

Another good resource is my free post on [self-publishing as a business model](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/e5udp0903t0up9dr/x1zvjk/aHR0cDovL2VsMi5jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9jL3ByZXZpZXcveDF6dmprL2FIUjBjRG92TDJKNWNtVm5hVzVoTG1OdmJTOXpaV3htTFhCMVlteHBjMmd0ZVc5MWNpMWliMjlyTHc9PQ==). We'll get into some of that post in this lesson, but our lesson has some additional important information, and that post goes into more detail on a few different things. I'd really recommend checking out both.

---

#### Step 1: Decide what you want to create and what format(s) best complement that.

If you want to create something that people can work through, then a workbook, printed book, or eBook that's printable might be best. If you want to create something portable that you can make revisions to often (ex: a book on something that changes frequently--like social media does), then an eBook might be your best option. Think through what you'll be communicating, and decide:

- Will it work as an eBook? Does it need to be limited to just an eBook? Will offering an eBook version make it more affordable/accessible for parts of my audience?
- Can it work as a printed book? Is it something I'd prefer to have printed for my audience or can they print it themselves from their home printer?
- Will the material be best complemented by worksheet pages? If so, which format works best?
- Will people want to listen to this book as an audio file? Will any of the book lose its meaning or value if translated into audio instead of being seen/read? How can I compensate for those changes if necessary?
- In which ways would my audience be used to consuming this type of information? What will be the easiest format(s) for them?
- What can I get to market quickly yet professionally? Should I consider all the formats?

*Hint: It's perfectly acceptable to release one version (say: print) first and wait a certain amount of time before the digital, audio, etc. versions are ready.*

---

#### Step 2: Decide your position and selling points. Give your book a clear place in the market.

Positioning is all about making sure your book stands out, making sure it has a recognizable position and differences from other books on the same topic, making sure there are benefits and qualities that make your book more attractive to certain people than your competitors' books.

**What's your book's position?**

When first starting out, I like to suggest one of two approaches:

- creating a very niche or very specific guide for your audience (ex: **A Graphic Designer's Guide to Getting Your First Client** )
- creating a very ultimate guide to something (ex: **The Only Book You'll Ever Need on Starting and Running a Graphic Design Business**–*but with a way better title, eh?* )

Taking a niche or ultimate approach will help you define, explain, and build your book's position--to the benefit of your customer and your business profits.

---

#### Step 3: Outline and research your book.

If you've known me for even a day, you've probably heard me talk about my index card outlining method. If not, I'll simply say: use whatever tool you feel most comfortable with to get a rough draft outline of what you want to cover with your book based on its topic, format, and position. Have that outline in mind when you turn to part B of this step--research.

Head to the bookstore, to [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com), or to your competitor's websites and begin to get a solid idea of what others have built into their books (and even workshops/courses) on your topic. Pay attention to their positioning and pricing.

Are you missing anything obvious? Is there any section/portion that seems unnecessary now that you see it elsewhere? What does your audience really need? What is too much or too fluff? What are areas of opportunity that others don't seem to be covering well?

My secret tip when creating information products is to read the Amazon reviews of other similar products, and see what reviewers are saying is missing, or is epic, or was disappointing, etc. This is a great place to do some research that will help you finalize your outline.

---

#### Step 4: Develop your book.

We won't dive deep into the details of writing, editing, and laying out your book here (mainly because there are so many details), but this is the step where you actually do the work of creating the book. What I want to discuss with you (below) are the avenues and platforms available to you based on the format(s) you've chosen for your book.

My course, [Zero to Self-Published Book (#ZeroToBook)](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/e5udp0903t0up9dr/e1pnyl/aHR0cDovL2VsMi5jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9jL3ByZXZpZXcvZTFwbnlsL2FIUjBjRG92TDNwbGNtOTBiMkp2YjJzdVkyOHY=), goes into more detail on writing your book, creating a book cover, laying out your book in Apple Pages, what each professional publication requires, how to set up a publishing company, launch ideas, and more--if you're interested in going much deeper into self-publishing.

---

#### Print Books + Workbooks (Tools and Software)

If you are going to be publishing something that you want to get printed for you (and perhaps even shipped out to the customer on your behalf), then these are the people, places, and things to look into:

**People:**

- **Substantive Editor (or a Peer Editor):** You will want someone who can look at the overall flow, layout, content, and style of your book to suggest major changes (missing sections, things that don't make sense, reorganization of your book, etc.).
- **Copyeditor:** Get a professional/freelance editor who can review your work. Especially when you are putting something in print, you want the fewest number of errors possible.
- **Proofreader:** Find someone (other than yourself--since you are so familiar with your work) who can take one last look at your work and check for remaining errors. Even professionally published books get released with a few mistakes, so you likely won't catch everything . . . but that last proofread will give you some extra peace of mind.

**Places:**

- **Printer:** Now it's time to find a print company. Look into places such as:
   - [CreateSpace.com](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/e5udp0903t0up9dr/41xkjn/aHR0cDovL2VsMi5jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9jL3ByZXZpZXcvNDF4a2puL2FIUjBjSE02THk5M2QzY3VZM0psWVhSbGMzQmhZMlV1WTI5dEx3PT0=) (I use them frequently; they also do order fulfillment through [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) and other retailers)
   - [IngramSpark.com](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/e5udp0903t0up9dr/ly60ym/aHR0cDovL2VsMi5jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9jL3ByZXZpZXcvbHk2MHltL2FIUjBjSE02THk5cGJtZHlZVzF6Y0dGeWF5NWpiMjB2) (great color printing options and prices)
   - [Blurb.com](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/e5udp0903t0up9dr/gykm1o/aHR0cDovL2VsMi5jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9jL3ByZXZpZXcvZ3lrbTFvL2FIUjBjRG92TDNkM2R5NWliSFZ5WWk1amIyMHY=) (magazines, photo books, etc.)
   - [Lulu.com](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/e5udp0903t0up9dr/vj52jo/aHR0cDovL2VsMi5jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9jL3ByZXZpZXcvdmo1MmpvL2FIUjBjRG92TDNkM2R5NXNkV3gxTG1OdmJTOWpjbVZoZEdVdlltOXZhM009) (calendars, photo books, and more)
   - [PrintNinja.com](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/e5udp0903t0up9dr/412oy0/aHR0cDovL2VsMi5jb252ZXJ0a2l0LmNvbS9jL3ByZXZpZXcvNDEyb3kwL2FIUjBjRG92TDNkM2R5NXdjbWx1ZEc1cGJtcGhMbU52YlM4PQ==) (comics, children's books, board games, wire-bound books, etc.)
- **Sales Channels:** Decide where you'll sell your book. Think about selling from your website, [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com), Etsy, or other online and real life retailers. With each decision, consider how involved you need to be and how much of your time + profits are being traded for each.

**Things:**

- **Layout Software:** Apple Pages, Adobe InDesign, Microsoft Word
- **Design Software:** Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Pixelmator

---

#### eBooks and aBooks (Platforms + Considerations)

Many of the people and things (discussed in the section above) remain the same when you publish eBooks or aBooks (audio books). But your places will likely change.

**Your first decision will be whether to offer your eBook in one or all of the following places/formats:**

- [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) (for the Kindle app)
- ePub (for other eReaders)
- PDF (to sell from your site or 3rd-party service)

**If you choose to sell a PDF version yourself, you'll want to look into:**

**For an audio book, you will want to decide where you'll offer it. Choose from places such as:**

- [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com)
- [Audible.com](http://Audible.com)
- iTunes store
- your site or a 3rd-party seller

**And if you decide to host + sell the audio file yourself, you'll want to decide if you're going to work out some custom delivery method, or use a service such as:**

- [Gumroad.com](http://Gumroad.com)
- [SendOwl.com](http://SendOwl.com)
- etc.

# *Lesson 4 - Create Tools + Physical Products*

When we think of infopreneurship, it's easy to picture courses, books, workshops, and other teaching-ish products. But, sometimes the best versions/applications of your knowledge and skills are to develop them as tools and physical products.

The way I see it though . . . is that the key is to not carry an inventory and to not have to do much (if anything) when an order comes through. If another company is doing order creation and/or fulfillment for you, your income can be very passive and not time-consuming for you.

By all means, you can still develop products that you create and ship out yourself, but in this lesson I'm going to focus on ones that require little to no involvement from you once the original product idea is developed.

Let's talk about creating digital tools as well as physical tools and products.

---

#### Creating digital tools.

There are multiple digital tools/products that you can create outside of the traditional information products:

1. Software
2. Apps
3. Templates (for blogs_websites, contracts_documents, etc., or even printables and checklists)
4. Systems (think of developing organization systems, processes, methods)

When I was developing web templates and organization systems, the biggest lessons I learned on making your ideas useful and saleable, was that you have to find unique ways to apply your experience and knowledge to your digital tools in order to make them more valuable than other similar tools. As someone who had blogged for years, my blog templates would have certain features built in that someone who only reads blogs (or just develops websites) might not have considered.

If you have experience as a photographer and business owner, when you develop software for photographers to upload and preview shots to a client, you will naturally think of multiple features that someone who merely develops software might not.

If you're tempted to skim through this section (or this lesson as a whole) because you don't think creating tools applies to your business or would be worth your time, I really want to encourage you to at least try to write answers to the questions in [the worksheets below](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/75ug72l2nf2ukvxx/l178yv/aHR0cDovL2J5cmVnaW5hLmNvbS90b29scy1xdWVzdGlvbm5haXJl).

**Creating physical products and tools.**

As you will discover in the worksheets above, you may be able to brainstorm and create:

- Digital tools that help your clients
- Software and apps that solve client pain points
- Physical tools or products that help your clients
- Physical products that have branded themes or fun messaging
- Printed books, workbooks, etc. that customers can use (from Lesson 3)

And the awesome thing is there are ways for you to get other companies/providers to process your client orders, create the products, and ship them to customers for you. This is called 3rd-party fulfillment. What kinds of things can you get created for you?

**Here are some ideas of products you can create (and get fulfilled for you):**

- Tote bags
- iPhone + iPad skins
- Art prints
- Wall art
- Mugs
- Posters
- Canvases
- T-shirts
- Throw pillows
- Hats
- Fabric
- Leggings
- Board games
- Laptop sleeves
- Wallpaper
- Calendars
- Planners
- Aprons
- Bibs
- Sunglasses
- And so, so, so much more

What do you think? Are there any physical products or digital tools you can see yourself creating after doing the worksheets below and checking out some of the sites above?

You can use a plugin like [WooCommerce](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/75ug72l2nf2ukvxx/vj43y5/aHR0cDovL3d3dy53b290aGVtZXMuY29tL3dvb2NvbW1lcmNlLw==) or a shop template from [Shopify](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/75ug72l2nf2ukvxx/7yw413/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2hvcGlmeS5jb20v) to integrate products from some of the companies above. Take a look at my niece's recently launched lifestyle shop for entrepreneurs as an example: [The Because Shop](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/75ug72l2nf2ukvxx/x1rx19/aHR0cDovL2JlY2F1c2VzaG9wLmNvLw==). It's a Shopify site, and whenever an order comes in, a separate company prints up her artwork on the shirt, pillow, etc. you ordered, then ships it directly to you. How cool is that? I'm so happy she's been letting me help with that business because I've been learning a lot about product-based businesses as we go. I hope you get excited as well as you go through the resources and work in this lesson.

So don't forget to try your hand at today's worksheets--and [tweet me](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/75ug72l2nf2ukvxx/wy0ly7/aHR0cDovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL2J5cmVnaW5hdHY=) any ideas you come up with, please

Awwwwwww yeah! InfopreneurIn5 has just 1 lesson left. How ya feeling? Tomorrow we'll be talking about hosting popular and profitable workshops as an infopreneur. I hope you're ready! If you think of anything you want to share or ask before then, please [tweet me](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/75ug72l2nf2ukvxx/oyvzjz/aHR0cDovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL2J5cmVnaW5hdHY=).

# *Lesson 5 - Host Popular and Profitable Workshops*

Today, I have a treat for you.

Not only do we have tips on planning a great workshop, but I also have a special page for you with a sweeeeet training on infoproducts and workshops if you want to go even further. The training is 2.5 hours long (whoa!) and it comes with a 15-page workbook. What?!

---

So, you can either jump straight into the [training here](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/o8udk8m86twuk30e/x1e516/aHR0cDovL2luZm9wcmVuZXVyd29ya3Nob3AuY29tLw==) and the [workbook here](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/o8udk8m86twuk30e/l178yv/aHR0cDovL2J5cmVnaW5hLmNvbS9pbmZvcHJvZHVjdC13b3Jrc2hvcC13b3JrYm9vaw==), or you can continue on below with some workshop tips and come back to this later.

In this lesson, we are chatting all about a fantastic form of content you can utilize to connect with your audience on a new level. Whether you’re doing live video or video you’re pre-recording and playing at specific times, using online workshops, seminars, or webinars can seriously up your business game.

In my [\#InfopreneurNinja](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/o8udk8m86twuk30e/q1opyg/aHR0cDovL2luZm9wcmVuZXVybmluamEuY29t) course, I have tons of lessons and worksheets on hosting workshops (there's so much you can do), but I've tried to include a few of my favorite key questions you’re going to want to ask yourself (to help direct and plan your online content) and a few tools you can use to host epic workshops.

While working through this info, you may want to take notes in a doc, blank sheet of paper, Evernote, etc. to jot down your answers. Also, try to keep your mind open in deciding what type of content to develop as you uncover answers to these guiding questions.

### Questions to Ask Yourself as You Plan Your Online Workshop

**1. What is the brand purpose of your event?**

Answering this questions will help you to set goals with and give purpose to your online workshops. For example:

- Is this video a gateway into a free/paid product?
- Is it a gateway to a service or string of other events you want followers to attend?
- Do you want to increase awareness of your blog or website?
- What is the point of your brand, and how does this event help you to accomplish that purpose?

Write down at least two brand purposes to make sure this event is a good way to spend your time.

**2. What is the purpose for the viewer?**

Most viewers are coming:

- to be able to asses their own interest in what you’re talking about
- with a specific intent or question
- to get a good overview of what they should be doing
- to get a good idea of what they want out of this sort of content

**3. What information will be communicated?**

For example, I once did an online workshop covering how to use Apple Pages ‘09 — I couldn’t teach the whole program in the hour, but before executing, I needed to think through what my audience's goals were in this. They probably need to learn the basics of how to create a worksheet or document, then they might need to know how to change colors, import a logo, etc.

So, think about what specific information will fit the needs of your audience. What do you think these needs are?

Take this answer and use it to plan out what you need to communicate based on these needs. If you need to map it out on index cards, do it!

**4. How long will it reasonably take to communicate the information?**

Once you map out your information, decide how long you think it will take to effectively communicate it.

Consider:

- Will there be an introduction?
- How long will it take to screenshare certain portions?
- Will there be a Q+A portion?

**5. How are you going to deal with questions?**

*Pro-tip: if your video is live, typically people like the ability to ask questions, so decide if this may or may not be appropriate for the type of video you think would be best.

- Will you only take questions before the event?
- Will you take questions throughout the event?
- Will you only take questions at a certain time toward the end of the event?

**6. How should you structure your time?**

If you decided it will reasonably take an hour, for example, how should you split up that hour to most effectively communicate the information?

Break down your content into an outline that will allow you to easily communicate to your audience. P.S. Don't forget to check out the workshop I included at the beginning of this lesson for an example workshop flow and all the collateral you'll want to develop for your workshop.

**7. What can you add in to accomplish your brand goal?**

For example, if this is going to be a gateway into a paid product:

- Do you need offer a discount?
- Sample of your first 5 pages free?
- What do you need to do to drive people to your brand goal?
- Maybe you want signups, test-outs, downloads?
- How will you get people there?

Think of anything extra you can add to get people to where you want them based on your brand goal from earlier.

**8. What can you add to help audience accomplish their purpose?**

Some examples:

- worksheets, checklists, agendas
- links or other resources
- slides to keep you on track and focus your audience

*Pro-tip: I find that worksheets are exceptionally effective if you have pre-submitted questions as well. It's super helpful to add in questions you’ll answer to any worksheets or materials you will provide so that people can jot down the answers.

**9. How long will it take to develop the content of the webinar plus any additional materials you’ll develop to accomplish your brand goal?**

When thinking through the time it will take, also consider how you will actually communicate your information—will you memorize your content, wing it, or make bullet points to go off of?

Some methods:

- apps that scroll your words like a teleprompter
- poster board behind camera
- small index cards
- notes on your notepad, laptop, etc.

There are a spectrum of options you can use to deliver a great presentation—I use bullet points so I don’t have to memorize everything (because that would stress me out), but still have the freedom to think through information and add/subtract as needed.

**10. Which platform makes the most sense for your event?**

There are many platform options you can utilize for your video content, so with your audience and brand goals in mind, think through which platform will make the most sense for you:

Some examples:

- pre-recorded and loaded on your website
- Google+ Hangouts On Air (on your site or embedded using [LeadPages](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/o8udk8m86twuk30e/x1zvjk/aHR0cDovL2J5cmVnaW5hLmNvbS9sZWFkcGFnZXM=) )
- [GoToWebinar](http://el2.convertkit.com/c/o8udk8m86twuk30e/e1pnyl/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nb3RvbWVldGluZy5jb20vd2ViaW5hcg==)
- Periscope

Do you have the software that meets your needs? For example, do you need to screen-share? Would you like questions to happen in a way that requires extra apps/software?

Take some time to sit down and really let these questions guide how you go about constructing your online workshop, seminar, or webinar. I truly do believe that this content is one of the best investments in your business you can make, especially if you think through how to create online interactions with you audience in a way that best fits their needs and lines up with your brand’s personality and goals.
