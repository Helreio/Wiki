Arguments

1. Writing is just a form of expression and communication.
2. Because writing allows us to express and communicate it also allows us to build connections and relationships with others.
3. When we express ourselves and try to communicate, there is always a risk of not being heard, being taken lightly, being ignored, or worse being criticized.
4. When a medium of expression always exposes us to feelings of being ignored, taken lightly, or criticized, we start associating it with these feelings and gradually distance ourselves from it.
5. Since expressing ourselves through writing is so important, we need to do something to be able to: express ourselves in this medium of our choice in a context where we feel heard and connected with others.
