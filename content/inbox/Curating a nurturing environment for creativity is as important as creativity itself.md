# Curating a nurturing environment for creativity is as important as creativity itself

Pursuing a creative life seems to involve two mutually exclusive categories of actions:

1. Developing one's prowess in the creative art itself, and
2. Curating a nurturing environment for the creative art.

The former is the main category, while the latter is a supportive category. A good way to differentiate primary actions from supportive actions is [[thoughts/purpose]]. [[Purpose organizes your life]] and [[Purpose differentiates between primary and secondary interests]].

However, working on supportive actions are as important as the main actions. This is because our minds are context-dependent.

In my case, supportive actions include projects like:

- Curating my information diet
- Building my ideal community
- Relocating to a better location
- Designing a nurturing workplace
- Improving my health
- Improving my finances
- Establishing a fun creative process
- Performing different experiments to resolve my current issues concerning my creative life

Life is not separate from creative work. Life is the environment from where creative work becomes possible.

To do:

- Research evidence that minds are context-dependent.
- Create a separate note on this: Our minds are context-dependent.
- Connect this with insights in your blog post on being a professional multipotentialite.
