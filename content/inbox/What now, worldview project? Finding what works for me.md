# What now, worldview project? Finding what works for me

So what do I do now?

With my worldview project?

I need to take note of the things that I am sure of.

I am sure of that most knowledge I want to learn are practical - meaning knowledge that is relevant for me.

The nature of this knowledge is subjective.

Therefore, it shouldn't be prescriptive.

People may find it helpful that is why I will share it.

But it is a mistake to prescribe it or claim that it is absolute.

At least not yet. Because I am not 100% sure that it is right to prescribe it.

So, my worldview project is really about finding "what works for me."

That's it.
