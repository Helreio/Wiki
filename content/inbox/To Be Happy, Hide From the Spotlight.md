# To Be Happy, Hide From the Spotlight

According to one 2012 [study](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0026369), fame is the biggest goal in life for children in the U.S ages 10 to 12. In a 2017 [survey](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/forget-law-school-these-kids-want-to-be-a-youtube-star.html) of 1,000 British children, [the most popular choice for a future career was](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3617062/children-turn-backs-on-traditional-careers-in-favour-of-internet-fame-study-finds/) “YouTuber.” Grown-ups are less willing to directly admit that they want to be famous, but according to Gallup, 92 percent of American adults [say](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59153bc0e6f2e109b2a85cbc/t/5d939cc86670c5214abe4b50/1569955251457/Populace+Success+Index.pdf) that *other* people believe “a person is successful if they are rich, have a high-profile career, or are well-known.”

“Fame is … That last infirmity of noble mind." - Johnu Milton

fame militates against the ingredients of well-being. The sooner we can take this lesson to heart and teach it to our kids, the better off we all will be.

fame might seem like an abstract problem. The thing is, fame is relative, and its cousin, [prestige](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11384884/)—fame among a particular group of people—is just as fervently chased in smaller communities and fields of expertise.

some of our drive for fame can likely be explained by simple evolution: Being known and admired by others makes us more likely to attract a mate and pass on our genes in a competitive environment.

One 2012 [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mar.20554) found a high correlation between wanting fame and a stated desire for social recognition, financial success, and an attractive appearance, and to appear on reality television. According to a 2013 [survey](http://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FAME-Greenwood.pdf), people might want to be famous in order to be seen and valued, even by strangers; to have an elite, high-status lifestyle; or to be able to do good for others, such as by being a role model.

Even if a person’s motive for fame is to set a positive example, it mirrors the other, less flattering motives insofar as it depends on other people’s opinions. And therein lies the happiness problem.

“Happiness is in the happy. But honor is not in the honored.”

fame is not found within ourselves but based on what scholars [call](https://doi.org/10.1002/mar.20554) extrinsic rewards, which research overwhelmingly shows bring less happiness than intrinsic rewards.

Worse, scholars say, [fame has become a form of addiction](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-008-9764-6). This is especially true in the era of [social media](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460316301095), which allows almost anyone with enough motivation to achieve recognition by some number of strangers, and as everyone in the world knows at this point, can be [highly addictive](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/)

The 19th-century philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer [said](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00009189#:~:text=Wealth%20is%20like%20sea%2Dwater,same%20is%20true%20of%20fame.&text=Every%20separation%20gives%20a%20foretaste,a%20foretaste%20of%20the%20resurrection.&text=Every%20man%20takes%20the%20limits,the%20limits%20of%20the%20world.) fame is like seawater: “The more we have, the thirstier we become.”

It is “like a river, that beareth up things light and swollen,” [said](https://books.google.com/books?id=Qo_Mhkcu8iAC&pg=PA269&lpg=PA269&dq=source+%22The+advantage+of+being+known+by+people+of+whom+you+yourself+know+nothing,+and+for+whom+you+care+as+little%22&source=bl&ots=v4T9Yw1jKe&sig=ACfU3U0GCqBk3HY5KMbrLvc9twCHvjF-Ww&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjOo5zG0r3zAhUAl3IEHQ-pCbsQ6AF6BAgOEAM#v=onepage&q=source%20%22The%20advantage%20of%20being%20known%20by%20people%20of%20whom%20you%20yourself%20know%20nothing%2C%20and%20for%20whom%20you%20care%20as%20little%22&f=false) Francis Bacon, “and drowns things weighty and solid.” Or take it from [Lady Gaga](https://twitter.com/ladygaga/status/1187543926678228993): “Fame is prison.”

Seeking out fame is a glitch in the happiness matrix: an urge that promises contentment and delivers the opposite. To defeat it, we need to be aware of our impulses and committed to countering them.
