# Moral abolitionism

In [[Amoralism]], moral abolitionism is the position taken by amoralists who thinks we need to get rid of all moral languageâ€”to reject the illusion of morality in its entirety. Their position is in contrast with [[Assertive moral fictionalism]] and [[Nonassertive moral fictionalism]] both of which believe on the usefulness of moral language. Moral abolitionists rejects this alleged usefulness, arguing that believing on an illusion is actually harmful.

[[Richard Garner]] is a moral abolitionist.
