# Tools should be embedded in a system to be effective

Tools by themselves are not enough to improve processes. They need to be embedded into a system to be effective.

In [[Personal knowledge management]] and [[Productivity]], tools need to be part of intelligently designed routines and workflows in order to make a difference.

This is why, when we design routines ([[My daily routine]], [[My weekly routine]], [[My monthly routine]]) or when we [[Use a note-writing system]], we need to start with the principles first before the tools. Tools need to help us execute our systems. An efficient system is a holistic system.
