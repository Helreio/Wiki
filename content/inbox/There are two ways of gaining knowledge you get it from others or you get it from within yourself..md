There are two ways of gaining knowledge: you get it from others or you get it from within yourself.

The problem with the bulk of our schooling is that we got most of what we were taught from "others." While obviously helpful in many circumstances, this method conditioned us to depend on the knowledge of others more than our own.

Say I didn't read a single word that Descartes wrote. I went to a hike and while walking I came to the conclusion that "I think therefore I am." I realized that the thought I discovered had profound consequences and therefore I wrote an entire essay about it. Upon publishing, people were quick to point out that what I discovered while walking was not "my thought." It wasn't original. It was Descartes' discovery.

I am expected by society to read everything I could read about a certain topic before I can create an original
