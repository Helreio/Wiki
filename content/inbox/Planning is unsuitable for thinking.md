# Planning is unsuitable for thinking

A plan makes you inflexible. It requires you to exert willpower, which is demotivating and incongruent with the open-ended process of thinking. [[The purpose of thinking is to produce insight]]. You cannot force the arrival of insight nor direct it towards a preconceived path. [[Insight cannot be predetermined]].

Thinking requires that you adjust your next actions based on new insight, which arrives frequently but not according to schedule. This constant adjustment means that you switch from one action to another when following an insight. It also means that you need to [[Use curiosity to guide your thinking]].

[[Writing that aims at insight must be organized in a flexible system]]. Instead of a plan, you need a workflow that optimizes freedom ([[A good workflow optimizes freedom]]) because [[Freedom motivates us]]. A workflow that involves a close cooperation with a collection of notes such as [[Zettelkasten]] and [[Talahardin]] is far superior than planning.

In a related note, even the [[Natural planning model]] outlined by David Allen is not really planning but an open-ended process.
