# 2020-11 Monthly report

## Summary

This was the first month I started writing my monthly highlights. It was a particularly creative month. I started the month by presenting an introduction to Thoreau’s creative life and process to three friends and Lea. I also revived my Weekly Newsletter alongside daily blogging, trying to imitate Austin Kleon. My goal was to use unschooling as an approach to my daily and weekly creative process, where in I create a little structure, which then allows me to enjoy lots of freedom within that structure. It was also a month of insights. I realized that while I do a lot of things, there are some things that are more important than others because of their closer proximity to the organizing principle or overarching mission of my life. Through Rem’s workshop on facilitation, I also understood that poetry and storytelling are more facilitative ways of writing as compared to essay writing.

- There’s the main work and there are supporting works.
- Learned about eliminativism.
- Rofel Brion, “I don’t take my writing seriously.”
