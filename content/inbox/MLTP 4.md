Any question that only she can answer is a question you need to get out of your mind

It doesnt matter if you know that it meant something to her.

This info is useless.

Love yourself to attract people who love themselves.

You can only love again if you are no longer afraid.

You will no longer be afraid if you know how to pick yourself up from the ground.

To find the right person you have to be the right person.

To love someone you have to love yourself.

Understand this: you can love somebody and they leave you for no reason.
