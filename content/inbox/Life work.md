# Life work

Life work is that thing we are called to do that also make us feel very good. It is what makes us different and unique from others. It is what we are able to do once our basic lower-level needs are met.

Life work is the collection of all these sources of self-actualization.

For my sources, see [[Characteristics of Self-Actualization Scale]].
