# Sea Change Quitting a Bad Habit

# *A Guide to Choosing a Bad Habit to Quit*

Choosing a bad habit for our Quit a Bad Habit module might be a bit difficult for some of you … so I’d like to give you some guidance as we prepare to get started.

For some of you, the choice is an obvious one: you want to quit smoking, or finally stop biting your nails. For others, there are too many choices, or you’re not sure what your best choices might be.

Or maybe you’re worried because you’ve failed at quitting the same habit multiple times.

Before I give you any guidance, you should answer one question: how good are you at habits?

Depending on how you’ve done with habits, you’ll be at one of three levels:

1. Level 1: You haven’t successfully formed a lot of new habits in the last year or two, have had trouble quitting bad habits, or have failed at many habit change attempts in the past.
2. Level 2: You’ve successfully formed new (good) habits more than once, perhaps 3-4 times, in the last year or so. You’ve had mixed success before that, but you’re definitely getting the hang of habit change.
3. Level 3: You’re pretty good at habits — perhaps you’ve formed multiple good ones, and even quit a bad habit or two. Maybe you’ve quit a bunch of bad habits, like smoking and junk food and procrastination. You’re ready for a new challenge.

Please be aware that quitting bad habits (like smoking and nail biting) is harder than starting a new one (like writing or meditating), because the old habit is ingrained and we can have addictions to break in some cases. This is an advanced skill, so **it’s important that you be honest about your habit abilities**, and choose the right level for you.

If there’s any uncertainty, **choose a lower level** rather than a higher one, so you don’t bite off more than you can chew and stack the odds against yourself. It’s much, much better to choose an easier habit and succeed than choose a more challenging habit and fail.

OK, we’re ready to pick a habit based on your level!

### Level 1 Habits

These are the most basic habits, but don’t underestimate them — they’re still hard. They’re just not as complicated.

Level 1 habits only occur once a day, maybe twice, or are pretty predictable. Also, ideally, they’re physical habits. And not super addictive.

Here are some examples:

- Checking Reddit when you first start work each day.
- Oversleeping
- Snacking on junk food in the mid-afternoon
- Coffee in the morning
- Watching TV at night
- Beer every evening
- Staying up late

These are not easy, but they’re more predictable than ones in Level 2 and 3, and usually less addictive — some of them have addictive properties, like beer, coffee and junk food, but they’re not as hard as cigarettes in my opinion.

I highly recommend most people choose something from this category.

### Level 2 Habits

This level is less predictable, but still a physical habit. They can be more addictive too, though not necessarily. The unpredictability of these habits and the frequency that they occur can make this a more difficult habit change, because you have to be more aware of your urges and be constantly vigilant.

Some examples:

- Smoking
- Biting nails
- Constantly checking your phone
- Online (or real-world) shopping
- Drinking soda
- Binge drinking
- Fast food
- Watching too much porn
- Video games
- Cracking knuckles
- Eating candy
- Eating when you’re not hungry

These habit changes require a higher skill level, because you need to not only be more aware, but willing to deal with messing up if you forget. This is something most people are *not* good at — most of us tend to give up on a habit change if there’s failure.

### Level 3 Habits

I only recommend these to people who have done some of the Level 1 and 2 habit changes successfully. They’re more difficult because most of them are mental habits, or they’re very addictive. Mental habits are harder to break because you can’t see them, which means you have to be aware of your own thinking a lot of the time. They’re not impossible to change, but you won’t be able to change them without some failure.

Some examples:

- Perfectionism
- Negative self-talk
- Snapping at other people with impatience
- Procrastination
- Criticizing other people
- Online distractions
- Fidgeting
- Sugar
- Painkiller and sedative addiction

Please note that this last one, or any real drug addiction, is beyond the scope of this course. I just wanted to list it for those wondering, but honestly, I don’t think you should choose a drug addiction for this course, other than lesser drugs like caffeine or nicotine.

OK, so those are the three levels for habits you might want to quit – and of course, there are many other habits that I haven’t listed, but you should be able to get the idea of what goes where.

If in doubt, choose an easier level than you think you might be capable of, at least for this month’s module. You can always tackle a harder habit later.

**ACTION STEP**: Today, you should pick a habit to quit in August. I’ll have more action steps in the next few days.

# *Join My Experiment in Quitting Habits*

I have two theories about quitting a bad habit — and they’re diametrically opposed.

The theories revolve around these two methods:

1. Quit cold turkey — put all your focus into quitting entirely, not allowing yourself a single exception. Just stop one day, and do everything in your power not to do the bad habit again.
2. Gradual quit — cut back a little on your bad habit (go from 20 cigarettes a day to 15), so that it’s not that hard. Then cut back a little more, and a little more, so that each step is not super hard.

I actually quit smoking with the first method (“Cold Turkey”) and it was very hard but it worked. This is the method I’ve been advocating for years.

But a psychologist told me last year about research around gradually cutting back, and I really like this idea. I’ve done the gradual method with my diet, and it works really well.

So which method is better? I don’t know.

I suspect that they both work, and it might depend on the habit, or the person.

I’d like to do an experiment this month, if you’re up for it.

### Our Quitting Experiment

Here’s how it will work:

1. You’ll choose a group — Cold Turkey or Gradual Quit — and sign up via this form.
2. You’ll report regularly (if you like) to one of two different forum threads. This is optional but recommended.
3. I’ll be giving you articles on quitting habits, but some articles will have different instructions/recommendations based on which group you’re in.
4. At the end of the month, you’ll report back to me (via another form I’ll send you) and tell me how you did.

With this very, very unscientific experiment, I think we’ll all learn more about what works best. I’ll report the results back to all of you. It’ll be fun!

Here’s how to sign up:

1. [Join the experiment using this form](http://goo.gl/forms/OHOSvRd9eV).
2. Say hello (and report regularly) to one of these two open teams: [Cold Turkey](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/forum/index.php?/topic/3938-quit-a-bad-habit-cold-turkey-open-team/) OR [Gradual Quit](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/forum/index.php?/topic/3939-quit-a-bad-habit-%E2%80%94-gradually-%E2%80%94-open-team/)

**PLEASE NOTE**: You won’t be quitting your habit starting Aug. 1 — I’d like you to use the first three days to monitor your habit, and write down what your triggers are. We’ll be actually quitting a few days into the month.

---

# *Track Your Triggers*

For the first few days of this month, I’d like you to *not* quit your habit yet. Instead, it’s important that you learn what your triggers are.

You might already have an idea, but for three days, I’d like you to be like a nature scientist, observing an animal’s habits in the wild. Just watch without interfering, and take notes.

What are you watching for?

1. Anytime you do the bad habit.
2. Anytime you have the urge to do it.
3. A situation, action, or feeling that precedes the first two (this is one of your triggers).

Basically, you want to be more aware of when you do the habit (or get the urge to do it), and what triggered that urge.

So if you bite your nails, you might notice that you get the urge to do it about 10 times a day, and that the urge comes after 1) you get nervous or anxious, 2) you have an upcoming meeting, 3) you are bored or lonely, and 4) when you’re hungry.

Record your triggers for three days, along with the approximate number of times you do the habit. This is essential for quitting your habit!

### Example Triggers

Just to give you an idea of triggers you might find, here are some ideas:

- An argument with someone
- Stress
- Other people drinking or smoking around you
- Being in a bar
- Going out to a restaurant
- Attending a meeting
- Anxiety about an upcoming event/meeting
- Boredom
- Loneliness
- Feeling bad about yourself
- Feeling overwhelmed
- Eating
- Feeling hungry
- Waking up
- Having coffee
- Having alcohol
- Eating sweets
- Eating salty or greasy food
- Sex
- Watching TV
- Turning on your computer
- Quiet time with nothing to do

These are just a start — you might find others. Have fun observing yourself in the wild!

# *Create a Simple Quit Plan*

Many people make the mistake of just trying to quit a habit without giving it much thought — they think it’ll be as simple as, “OK, I’m just going to stop today!”

And if they’re lucky, it can be that easy. Most of us aren’t as perfect at it as that, so for the rest of us, we need to give some thought to triggers, replacement habits, reminders, accountability, and more.

Enter the simple Quit Plan.

I’ve created a [template for creating your Quit Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rFlNPkRt5q-IWgC5GDFDQelfdjZ3aKNDSFQQgnTNDKQ/edit) … just know that it’ll take you about 10 minutes to fill out, and you should start doing it today. You can add to it as you go.

### Your Powerful Reason for Quitting

The biggest mistake a lot of us make is quitting a habit because it sounds like a good idea. This doesn’t work. You have to have a really good reason.

For example, here are two of my failed quits:

- I quit coffee because I thought it would be nice to be unattached. But coffee wasn’t causing any major problems in my life, so after a month of being coffee-free, I started again. This happened to me twice, and now I’ve decided not to try to quit it because I don’t care enough.
- I quit alcohol for a month because I overdid it a couple nights, but after about a month I went back to my more moderate habit of having 1-2 glasses of wine each evening. The real motivation was that I didn’t like overdoing it, not that having 1-2 glasses of wine was causing any major problems.

I’ve done similar things for sugar, white flour, etc. … I was able to quit them for a month, but I wasn’t incredibly motivated to change because doing these things in moderation doesn’t cause me problems. I don’t eat a lot of sugar, but a little doesn’t seem to harm me.

By contrast, I was able to quit smoking, meat, dairy & eggs, fast food and more when the reasons were more powerful:

- **Smoking**: My motivation was not only that smoking was killing me, but that it would cause my kids to smoke as adults if I didn’t stop. So I was doing it to save my life, and the lives of my kids.
- **Meat_poultry_fish**: I became vegetarian because 1) I thought it would help my health (it did, mostly because I ate more veggies and fewer calories), and more importantly, 2) I didn’t feel it was necessary to cause suffering and killing of animals for my pleasure. So it was for my health, but more importantly out of compassion for other beings.
- **Veganism**: I went from vegetarian to vegan, despite loving cheese (at the time, not anymore), when I learned of the horrible things that happen to dairy cows, baby cows (veal), egg hens, baby chicks, just so I could eat some cheese and eggs. It turns out that there’s horrible suffering and killing just for our pleasure, so I was motivated to not participate in this system of suffering. Quitting became easy.
- **Fast food**: I stopped going to fast food because it wasn’t good for my health, nor my kids. We haven’t been to McDonald’s (or Taco Bell, etc.) for probably 8 years or so. The health of my family was a powerful motivator.

Whatever habit you quit, make sure you have a very strong reason. And write it down in your Quit Plan. If you don’t have a good reason, dig deeper and find one, or find another habit to quit instead.

### ACTION STEPS

Today, I’d like you to do the following:

1. [Copy the Quit Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rFlNPkRt5q-IWgC5GDFDQelfdjZ3aKNDSFQQgnTNDKQ/edit) to your Google Docs, or download it to open in a text editor or Word.
2. Continue to track your triggers for the next couple of days. Write them on the plan.
3. Write down your Why and fill out a few other things on the plan.

You can see an example of a Quit Plan by [looking at mine here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ORc-lCC5FpWF4KEE924Cn9wFovrt1VQ0DZF6oy72cRU/edit).

# *Cold Turkey vs. Quitting Gradually*

OK, you’re ready to start your quit … but how do you do it if you’re quitting cold turkey vs. quitting gradually?

In this article, I’d like to briefly outline ideas for doing each of these methods.

If you haven’t yet, please [join our habit experiment here](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/quit-experiment/).

### Quitting Cold Turkey

So you’re one of the many who signed up to quit all at once … should be easy, right? You just stop.

Actually, you’ll increase your chances of success if you do more than that, and understand how quitting a habit works.

Here’s what I suggest:

1. **Pick a habit that’s at your level**. Read this [guide to choosing a habit to quit](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/choose-bad-habit/) if you haven’t yet. Don’t choose a habit that’s too hard for you.
2. **Track your triggers**. Before you go cold turkey, you should know that the urge will come up, and it will be strong. The urges come after certain triggers. Before you quit, [track your triggers for a few days](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/track-triggers/).
3. **Make a plan & understand why**. Create a Quit Plan that contains a powerful reason for quitting. If you don’t have a powerful reason, you won’t last.
4. **Have replacement habits for each trigger**. We’ll talk more about this tomorrow, but for now, think about what you’ll do *instead of* the habit, when each trigger comes up.
5. **Have reminders**. How will you remember to do your replacement habit when the triggers happen? Find reminders.
6. **Have accountability**. [Join the Cold Turkey Open Team](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/forum/index.php?/topic/3938-quit-a-bad-habit-cold-turkey-open-team/) on the forum, and report to them regularly. Ask for help if you’re having trouble!

Also know that you might fail, but that’s OK. Don’t let yourself give up just because you messed up. Figure out what the obstacle was, figure out a solution, put it on your Quit Plan, and get better and better at the habit!

### Quitting Gradually

I highly recommend you do *all* the steps listed above for quitting cold turkey. Seriously, go read them now if you haven’t yet! They all apply.

But instead of joining the Cold Turkey Open Team, please [join the Gradual Quit Open Team](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/forum/index.php?/topic/3939-quit-a-bad-habit-%E2%80%94-gradually-%E2%80%94-open-team/).

In addition, you’ll want to figure out a gradual schedule. Here’s one idea:

1. Figure out how often you normally do the bad habit now. It might be 15 times a day, or just 2 times.
2. Come up with a way to do less for the first week. For example, if you do the habit 15 times a day, try to do it 2 times less for the first week. So try to do your replacement habit 2 times a day for the first week.
3. Increase the times you do your replacement habit by a little each week. Maybe 4 times the 2nd week, 6 the third week, etc. Or maybe you just increase by 1.

Realize that this method takes patience, because you won’t be changing all at once. This can be a challenge for some of us who want to see amazing results right away. But with this gradual method just might be more long-term success, so stick with it!

Also realize that you might not be completely quit by the end of the month. That’s OK. You’ll be a lot farther along, and you should continue your focus on gradually quitting next month as well. Rome wasn’t built overnight!

# *Video: All About Replacement Habits*

This is a crucial topic, so I urge you not to skip this video and the accompanying article!

Today we’re going to talk about replacement habits — when your trigger happens, instead of doing your old bad habit, you’re going to do a new replacement habit.

Watch the video to learn all about choosing replacement habits and implementing them … then read below for more info. (Watch below or [download here](http://sea-change.s3.amazonaws.com/Replacement%20habits.mp4).)

OK, let’s talk about some ideas for replacement habits!

### A Handful of Examples

I can’t possibly give examples for every need (discuss it [on the forum](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/forum/)!), but here are a few examples …

Needs & possible replacement habits:

- Stress: meditate, go for a walk, exercise, have tea, take a bath, talk to someone.
- Boredom: Practice a skill, read, learn something new, help someone, work on a side project, collaborate with someone, train for a race.
- Loneliness: Go to a meetup, join a running club, make plans to hang out with friends, call a loved one, journal.
- Need personal space: Go for a walk, read in the park, meditate in your room or outdoors.
- Need to unwind: all the ones under stress (above) are good ideas.

These are just some examples, but you get the idea. The need is what your old bad habit is fulfilling when your trigger comes up, so your new replacement habit should meet the same need if possible.

**ACTION STEP**: Open your [Quit Plan](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/quit-plan/), and add your replacement habit(s) for each trigger. If you’re not sure what to do, [ask on the forum](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/forum/), and be willing to experiment until you figure out what works for you. Don’t be in a rush to figure it out on day one.

# *Remembering to Do Your Replacement Habit*

As you’ve been trying to do your [replacement habit](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/replacement-habits/) this week, many of you will notice that it’s hard to remember to do your replacement habit when [your triggers](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/track-triggers/) happen.

That’s been my experience this week: I’ve remembered to do my replacement habit some of the time, and forgotten most of the time. (Read my Quit Journal.)

This is the reason that I recommended that you [choose Level 1 bad habits](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/choose-bad-habit/) this month if you’re not already good at forming habits — these easier habits are mostly easy because it’s easier to remember to do your replacement habit when the bad habit is physical and predictable.

When the bad habit or triggers come at variable times, it’s hard to remember to do the replacement habit. When the bad habit is a mental habit (like negative thinking), it’s hard to notice you’re doing them, and it’s hard to notice the trigger, so you forget.

That said, here are some ideas for getting better at remembering to do your replacement habit:

1. Make remembering a big focus for your day. Think about it when you wake up, put a sign on your computer, talk to other people about it, think about it most of today. If it’s not important, you won’t remember.
2. Put up a sign or some other note around where your trigger normally happens.
3. Wear a rubber band or bracelet, or draw a smiley face on your hand, as a reminder to yourself.
4. Ask other people to remind you.
5. Put up a note on your mirror, so you’ll remind yourself at least once a day.
6. Send yourself email or phone reminders throughout the day.

The main thing is to put this at the forefront of your consciousness more often, and you’ll remember more. You won’t be perfect at it at first, if it’s a difficult habit to remember, but that’s OK. Get better each week.

---

# *Watch Your Urges, and Delay*

As you work on doing your replacement habit this week, you’ll likely notice that you get the urge to do the old habit, or the urge to not do the new habit.

These urges are very easy to follow, because we often do it without thinking about it.

The urge to pick your nose comes up, and without thinking, your hand moves to your face. It’s an automatic action that takes no conscious thought on your part.

The trick is to pause.

Start to become aware of your triggers, and the urges that follow the triggers.

See the urge, and then instead of automatically acting on the urge, *just pause*.

This pause is the key skill you want to practice this week.

Sit there (or stand there) and just watch the urge rise, getting stronger, rise some more. It will eventually crest, then start to fall, and fade away. Then it might come back, rise, crest, then fade away again. If you just pause, you can get through any urge.

If you’re having trouble with an urge, breathe. Go for a walk. Ask someone for help. Do some pushups. Drink some water, or have some tea. Do something to get your mind off the urge, but don’t let yourself follow it.

With practice, you can get good at recognizing the urge when it comes up, and delay, delay, delay. You’ll get good at the pause, and distracting yourself, or just meditating on the urge. You’ll become the master of your urges, instead of allowing them to master you.

---

# *Shining Some Light on Your Rationalisations*

If you’ve been [watching your urges](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/urge-delay/) and trying to delay acting on them … you might have run into some problems by now.

It’s not always easy to *not* follow your urges.

And the main reason is all in your head. The biggest obstacle most of us face is not physical addiction, but rationalizations that we make with our minds.

What you might be learning is that your mind (all of our minds, in fact) is an amazing rationalization machine. We’ve grown exceptionally good at rationalizing, our minds getting what they want, because it’s something we’ve been practicing daily since childhood.

It works like this: we get a craving for something (ice cream) and though we rationally know that we don’t *need* this ice cream, nor would it be good for our hearts … our minds start convincing us that we should do it. And because this rationalizing happens out of sight, we don’t even realize this is happening. It has a power over us that we don’t realize.

This happens too with exercise: the rationalizing part of our minds doesn’t like the discomfort of exercise, so it convinces us to skip the exercise.

The same thing happens with procrastination, with eating habits, with checking our phones and looking at distractions. Rationalizing has a hidden power over us.

The solution lies in shining a light on the rationalizations.

### Shining a Magical Light

When rationalizations live in the unseen dark corners of our minds, they have a power over us like nothing else. We are powerless if they are hidden.

So when we bring them out to the light of day, they lose their power.

Here’s how it works: when you notice an urge, and tell yourself to delay … and then you ignore that command and start to do it, realize that the rationalizing process is going on. Pause, and notice what excuses you’re giving yourself.

Examine those excuses. Are they true? Or are they just bullshit reasons so your mind can get what it wants? The mind wants to give in to cravings (pleasure), or avoid discomfort (pain). It will lie to get its way.

Some of the lies include:

- Just this once won’t matter.
- It’s not good to make yourself suffer.
- It’s OK to give in for now.
- You’re not as strong/disciplined as those other guys.
- You shouldn’t do this, you’re weak.
- This isn’t really cheating.
- No one will know.
- You deserve a break.
- This doesn’t count.
- You deserve a reward.

And so on. You’ll notice that these seem to make sense, in the moment of weakness. They *feel* true. But they aren’t.

The truth is that it does matter. You made a promise to yourself and breaking it matters.

The truth is that it’s not OK to give in, because that erodes your trust in yourself.

The truth is that no one is perfect, but you are plenty strong.

The truth is that you deserve to succeed at this. Your reward will be in a successful habit change, in feeling good about yourself.

The truth is that you will know.

Shine a light on the rationalizations, and have an answer to them *before* you get to that moment of weakness. Think about it when you’re feeling strong.

**ACTION STEPS**: Spend the next few days watching your rationalizations, and writing them down in your journal. Come up with an answer to each of them. Shine a light on the rationalizations when they happen, and see if you can call “bullshit” on them.

# *Webinar Recording: A Primer on Quitting*

In this webinar, I went over the mechanics of quitting a habit, how to choose a “bad” habit to quit, and how to overcome common obstacles.

The notes are below … you can watch the video here, or [download it here to watch on your computer/device](http://sea-change.s3.amazonaws.com/Webinar%20-%20A%20Primer%20on%20Quitting.mp4).

### The Notes

What are bad habits? Things that cause problems in your life — if the problem is bad enough, you’ll be motivated. Otherwise, you will probably not stick to the habit change

Basic mechanics are simple: Track your triggers, figure out needs, choose replacement habits, set up reminders, consciously do the replacement habits instead of the bad habit

But there are challenges – let’s talk about them and give some solutions:

1. Change is uncomfortable — do it gradually, or be in the right mindset
2. Forget to do the habit — put up visual reminders, maybe something on your wrist or hand
3. Don’t notice the urge — daily journaliing, make adjustments so you get better at it, have accountability
4. Setbacks/failures — don’t expect perfection, expect to get better at it with time
5. Wanting to quit the quit — set up accountability (“How not to die”)
6. Rationalizations — accountability

The things required to quit bad habits are skills, and they are learned with practice, not mastered in a day. Don’t expect to master these skills this month even, but think of this as a starting point, and work on getting better and better over time.

Some of the skills:

- Understanding triggers
- Being mindful of your urges
- Being mindful of your rationalizations
- Remembering to do your replacement habit
- Creating accountability
- Reviewing your habit progress and adjusting regularly

# *A Meditation on Coping with Difficult Feelings*

In this video, I talk about how our bad habits are a result of wanting to run away from, or avoid, the difficult feelings that we inevitably deal with on a daily basis:

- Stress
- Sadness/depression
- Anger_frustration_irritation
- Loneliness
- Feeling overwhelmed
- Feeling guilty
- Feeling bad about yourself

These are things we must cope with, and we usually cope by avoiding the feelings and trying to find pleasure in something else.

The meditation I share in the video is a way to deal with those feelings in a healthy way.

Watch the video below, or [download here to watch on your device/computer](http://sea-change.s3.amazonaws.com/Meditation%20for%20Difficult%20Feelings.mp4).

# *Getting Over the Three-Week Slump*

Over a number of habit changes, I noticed that there was always a period when my initial enthusiasm faded, and I struggled to stay with the habit change.

When it comes to changing habits, your best friend is complete focus, having nothing else in your life that matters while you concentrate on this one change.

Unfortunately, most of us actually do have other things that matter — family, job, friends, emergencies, travel, sickness. And so these pull away our focus, and anything that pulls your focus away threatens to derail the entire process.

You might be feeling that now. I call it the “Three-Week Slump.”

In fact, I’m going through it myself — I’m traveling at the moment, and getting out of my routine has made sticking to my new habit difficult. I still think about the habit every day, but mostly in the context of, “Oh darn, I’m not really doing the new habit because I’ve been so busy, and now I haven’t been updating my log in awhile and I feel guilty about that!”

So what’s the solution to this slump? Actually, it can be overcome, you just need to take a few steps:

1. **Recognize you’ve hit the Three-Week Slump**. I should note that the “three-week” thing is just an estimate … sometimes it hits in the 2nd week or 4th week, depending on what’s going on in your life. At any rate, recognize that you’re not as motivated, that you’ve messed up or are in danger of losing focus. Don’t panic! This is fixable.
2. **Quickly … make a commitment!** All it takes is an email to a friend. Tell them you’re in a slump, and you need their help. Promise to get back on track by doing your habit, updating your log, whatever … and promise to report to them every day for the next 3 days. This is an easy step — it’s just a quick email!
3. **Now that you’ve committed, follow through for three days**. You just need to take the first step. Open up your log. Get your running shoes ready. Put your yoga mat where you can’t miss it. Take a very small steps to get things going, and follow through on your commitment. Don’t mess up!

If you can get it going again for a few days, you’re back on track. Report to your friend every day. At the end of the three days, if you feel good again, no need to continue with your friend, but reach out to him or her whenever you feel the slump coming back on.

Now get to sending that email!

# *Dealing with Opposition from Others*

When you’re quitting a bad habit, sometimes the biggest obstacle isn’t you — it’s the people around you.

Those bastards.

The opposition can come in many forms:

- Your spouse/partner feels threatened by this new change you’re making and seems to resent it. Perhaps you both drink alcohol or smoke together and you’re trying to quit, or you both enjoy eating pizza together and you’re trying to eat healthier.
- Your friends give you a hard time because you’re not joining them in something you usually do.
- Your family thinks it’s weird that you’re changing like this, and feels defensive because it seems like your change is a criticism of their lifestyle (if you’re become vegetarian and they eat meat, for example).
- You might feel left out if you don’t join people in the things you normally do, or feel like an outsider.
- You might hear complaints, get into arguments, get the silent treatment, hear sighs or see the rolling of eyes.

I’ve experienced all of these, and I’m sure most of you have as well. Change is hard, including on those around us.

So how do we deal with this obstacle?

I don’t have any easy answers, unfortunately. What we have to realize is that the responses and feelings of other people are out of our control … you can’t *make* people support you.

Instead, you can focus on what’s under your control:

1. You can have compassion for their difficulty to deal with change.
2. You can have a conversation with them, to try to help them understand … and not be attached to the outcome of them actually understanding.
3. You can change what’s under your own control.
4. You can find others who will support you, or who are going through similar changes.

I’ve found these all to be great approaches for dealing with the opposition of others in my life to the changes I’m making.

### 1. Compassion for their difficulty

Have you ever had a hard time with someone you love changing something you shared together? Have you ever had difficulty with change? Chances are, we have all struggled with these issues. We know what it’s like to deal with loss — in this case, the loss of the life you’re used to, when someone in your life is changing.

It’s very helpful to try to understand the feelings that the people around you are going through, as you make your change. You might wish they could just understand and be supportive, but the truth is that they’re going through their own experience here, and they have legitimate feelings about the changes you’re making. Try to understand what those feelings might be. Ask them, if you have to.

When you think you know what those feelings are, remember a time when you’ve had similar feelings. It might not have been pleasant, right? How do you feel about someone you know and love going through these feelings?

Just this step can often be enough — to understand the other people in your life, to go from “I wish they’d support me” to “I wish an end to their difficulties”. This helps you, and might soften you to them.

### 2. Have a conversation

Once you’re in a place of compassion, you might try to talk to the people in your life who are having difficulties with your change. Tell them you understand they have trouble with your change, and ask about their feelings. See if you can hear where they’re coming from, before you start to defend or explain yourself. Seek to understand first.

Most likely, the first conversation you have with them won’t convert them to your side. Don’t be attached to that outcome. Share what motivates you, what inspires you, to make this change. What benefits do you hope to get?

Talk about their objections, and how you had the same worries too, and then share what helped you overcome those worries.

Ask if they’re willing to support you, but be prepared to be OK if they’re not.

Finally, realize that this is a process. You went through a process to decide to make a change, and you can’t expect everyone else to instantly understand. They need to go through their own process too, and it might take longer for them. You don’t control it, and you can practice being happy with what you can control — your own thoughts and actions.

### 3. Change what’s under your control

So if you can’t control others, what can you do? There are some things you can focus on instead:

- Practice mindfulness, noticing your breath, how your body feels, what the feelings are like, as you practice your habit change, and as you talk to others.
- Learn to see the ideals that are causing your frustrations — ideals that you’ll be a more perfect habit changer, ideals that others will support you more fully. These ideals aren’t real, and they are causing you to be unhappy. Try letting go of them and accepting the reality in front of you.
- Find things to be grateful about, in the moment of your habit change, in the moment you’re talking with others. Be grateful there are other people in your life to cause frustrations and complications!
- Practice understanding the others in your life better, even if they aren’t good at understanding you.

These are just a few examples, but you can see how a focus on these things that are under you control might be more helpful than being frustrated by the things out of your control.

### 4. Find others to support you

If your spouse or other loved ones won’t support you, you might find others who can meet that need. There are great online communities, from Sea Change to people who are quitting smoking, drugs, porn and more. People who are starting to run, to do yoga, to meditate.

Find these people, and say hello. Be bold, and jump in! Get to know them, share a bit about yourself. Be helpful, polite, kind, and friendly.

You might even be able to find people to support you in the real world — other friends, coworkers, people at running groups or classes or meetups in your city. It can be awesome to connect in person with others who are going through similar things.

The support you get from people online or in the real world can make all the difference in the world. You can create the support you need, instead of being unhappy with what you’re not getting.

# *Continuing Your Quit, & How to Manage Multiple Habits*

As we wrap up our month of Quitting a Bad Habit, the question is, “Where do I go from here if I haven’t completely quit yet?”

Even if all has gone well, you might not be completely over your bad habit. And for many of you, things haven’t gone “perfectly” (which is totally fine!), and so you need more work on this habit.

I have three options for you:

1. Continue your sole focus on this quit for another month.
2. Give up on the quit (if you’re not enjoying it) but remember the lessons you learned.
3. Start a new habit next month, but continue putting some focus on continuing to quit your bad habit.

Each of these is completely valid. I’ll talk about each briefly below, along with ideas about managing multiple habits at once, and finally, the temptation to keep adding new habits.

### Option 1: Make it a 2-month Quit

This is actually a great option for most people, and I do recommend it if this quit has been important to you. Doing the quit for another month will really cement the habit. However, for lots of us, it’s hard to keep up enthusiasm for one habit change for more than a month. So it depends on where you are with this quit.

I recommend you choose this option (continue for a 2nd month) if one or more of these are true:

1. You’re quitting a habit that is life changing — like smoking, or eating junk food — and really sticking to this quit will make a huge difference in your life.
2. You’re still motivated and think you can keep focus for another month with enough motivation.
3. You don’t like to do too much at once, and the thought of doing another habit next month sounds overwhelming or too fast for you.

Some people don’t like to overdo things, and others like to keep things fresh and add new habits each month. There’s no right way.

### Option 2: Give up on the Quit

If you’ve struggled with this quit, and you really don’t feel like continuing, there’s no shame in giving up. However, if you’ve done fairly well and you are just rationalizing going back to your old bad habit because you feel the urge … you might want to stick with it so you don’t waste all your hard work.

Even if you do quit, don’t just wash your hands of it all and forget about it. Try to take away important lessons from this quit … for example:

1. Awareness of your triggers, urges and rationalizations.
2. Knowledge of what replacement habits work for you.
3. The skill of remembering to do the replacement habit.
4. The importance of reviewing, journaling, and accountability.

You might have learned even more than this — I would take a few minutes to review your month, and write down your key lessons so you don’t forget.

It might be that you try this quit in the future. I would save your Quit Plan for your next time, and add your notes at the bottom for your future self, to make your next attempt more likely to succeed. Sometimes it takes several attempts (or more) for a quit to stick, but if we’re learning from each attempt, none of them are wasted efforts.

### Option 3: Continue the Quit, but also add a new habit

I’m guessing many of you will choose this option — you’ve done fairly well on the quit, and you want to continue, but you feel there’s room for more than one habit in your mindspace right now. That’s totally legitimate.

A few things to keep in mind:

1. You will still need to continue focus on this habit, even while starting a new habit (more on this in the section below).
2. I would still write down the lessons you learned, as in the section above, to cement your learning.
3. Help others who are trying to quit the same time — it’s a great way to go deeper into your learning and makes you more likely to stick with it for the long term.

More tips for you are in the next section — please read!

### Managing Multiple Habits

OK, so you’re going to take on a 2nd habit — or perhaps you already have multiple habits from previous months, and want to know how to manage them all.

This is an advanced habit skill, and many people ignore the complexities of it. I can’t tell you exactly how to juggle multiple skills in your life, as it depends a lot on your life circumstances, what motivates you, how good you are at focusing on several things (managing your focus), etc. But I’ll try to share what works for me.

Some things that I’ve found to work:

1. You’ll need to maintain focus on your previous habit(s), not just assume that it (or they) will continue without any effort. Have a regular reminder, put up visual reminders, so that you don’t forget.
2. Start a new habit with care. It shouldn’t be so difficult or overwhelming that it takes all your focus away from previous habits. Start easy, especially if you’re not already decent at doing more than one habit at once.
3. Be very careful about taking on more than one new habit (in addition to the old ones you’ve been doing from previous months). More on this below, but there are constant temptations to start new habits depending on things you read online or people in your life who are inspiring you to try new things.
4. Keep your social accountability for your old habit(s). In the 2nd month of forming a new habit or quitting a bad habit, you need less accountability, but not zero. You might continue with weekly reports, but not daily, unless you feel you need the motivation. But daily accountability takes work, and doing daily accountability for two habits is tough.
5. You might motivate yourself to stay accountable for previous habits by promising something big to other people — for example, “If I don’t stick to my Quit Smoking challenge for the 2nd month, I will allow you all to cover me in smelly slime, and videotape it!”
6. If you’re adding a new habit, it’s great to find one that will complement the previous one that you’re still working on. For example, if you’re trying to meditate, and you previously were trying to wake early, then meditating in the morning can work well with your old habit. If you were trying to quit smoking, and starting a daily walk or run will help you with stress relief (replacing smoking for that trigger), then those two habit changes are complementary.

In the end, managing multiple habits is an art rather than science, which means that you need to figure out what blend of motivation, focus, reminders, accountability, and complementary habits works for you. Don’t expect to get that mix right instantly — your life is an experiment where you’re trying to figure that out, and where you learn from failed attempts.

### Temptation to Do More & More Habits

Many of you will have the same problem I have: it’s hard to focus on only one habit at a time. As one Sea Change member writes:

> “I’ve come to realize my constant inability to really focus on one habit at a time. … There is a constant need or desire to become this perfect imagined self. I’m holding the years worth of knowledge of reading about habit change and healthy lifestyles that each time I cook, or decide not to exercise, I know a better choice exists.”

What a great observation! Understanding how to deal with this starts with the realization that you’re not good at stopping yourself from trying new habits all the time, and that you have an ideal self that you’re trying to realize, as soon as possible.

Another key realization that I’ve made is that while it’s easy to start a handful of new, healthy habits all at once … it’s not effective. I’ve found in many failed attempts that if I’m not focusing on one new habit at a time, I can’t keep focus or motivation on all of them at once. This is a great recipe for failure!

So realize that you’re trying to achieve an ideal self, that you’re not good at stopping from starting new habits, and that this method doesn’t work too well. This method won’t achieve your ideal self, because you’ll fail. (Actually, you’ll never achieve your ideal self, but you can definitely make improvements.)

The only method I’ve found to work is slow change, one change at a time. If you believe me, then make this a mantra. Slow change, one change at a time.

Make a habit list: what habits do you want to change? What have you already changed? At the top of the list, write the one small habit that you are currently changing. Only one. Every time you feel the urge to start a new habit, consider whether it should replace your current habit as your One Single Habit you’re working on right now. If not, then add it to the ones you want to change in the future. You might have two years’ worth of habits you want to change, but this is a much more effective method than trying to change them all this month, or even in the next few months.

One small change at a time, and you’ll change your entire life.
