# What will happen when I get home

I will see the dogs, spend time with them. But after a few days, perhaps even just a day, I will feel alone with my thoughts again, the dogs just backgrounds of my life.

My return home will not be the good thing I am expecting. I have been successful distancing myself from home and finding traction. I'm starting to feel happier. And I dont think going back home for a visit will help me in that distancing process. People there just don't see me and my values enough.

Therefore, this going home, which takes time, money, and effort should be something I really evaluate before I commit to it.
