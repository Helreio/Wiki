# Minimum Viable Productivity

I think I really need to research how James Clear does it (maybe even Scott Young).

The most important actions I want to take every day are few. These are actions I want to make sure I do.

If these things are things I want to do continuously and nurture, then I don't have to put them in my task management system. They need to have an entirely different tracking system. A habit tracker could do. Perhaps this is where PARA could work for me.

But I don't have to research every little technique or principle. What I need to do is work on what I already know, try, then tweak as I go.
