# How Craig Mod works

[[thoughts/craig mod]] show his behind the scenes ([[thoughts/work with the garage door up]]) to members of his Special Projects membership. People get to know him mostly through his finished products. But he does share his processes and life updates in his newsletter—although he doesn't do it messily. He shares it in a polish and edited manner.

Craig uses his entire morning either reading or writing. He publishes two newsletter weekly: Ridgeline, the walking newsletter, and Huh, the photo essay newsletter. I imagine that Craig Mod uses some of his mornings just writing and rewriting these newsletters (it is from him where I first realized the importance of rewriting one’s drafts, something [[David Sedaris]] is also a fan of). Once a month, he publishes another newsletter, which has a wider range of topics, Roden. This is a long newsletter, which would require some research. For sure, he does his research and rewrites in the morning.

Craig does not do daily IG posts—although he seems to be quite active in his IG stories. Most of his work are published in his newsletter and blog. He writes several essays for publications once in a while.
