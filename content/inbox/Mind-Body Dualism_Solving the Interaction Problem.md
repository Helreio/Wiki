# Mind-Body Dualism: Solving the Interaction Problem

If mind and body are in different ontological categories, then how could they possibly interact with each other?

Steve’s theory supports both substance dualism and substance pluralism.

**Theory of indirect interaction**

Mind and body do not directly interact, but they *effectively* interact – i.e. the state of one affects the state of the other.

Steve does not claim that he has discovered the real mechanism behind interaction. This theory only proves that “in principle” such interaction can be explained.

Here is a summary of the theory:

We start with atoms in space. The universe has information about the position of the atoms in space. That information is used as an input into a function that we call “the laws of physics.” It then generates a new output state – i.e. atoms change position. The universe has information about this new state, which then gets put back into the function to generate subsequent output states. The universe progresses.

If this theory works, then we’ve just solved the mind-body problem and the problem of interaction. All we’ve got to do is add mind.

**The states of ontological categories affect each other via an abstract mechanism**

**The pros of the theory of indirect interaction**

- In this theory, interaction is not limited between mental and physical objects only. All objects from all ontological categories could interact.
- In this theory, one ontological category can affect another and vice versa.
- The theory works even without free will.
- It broadens, not breaks, the laws of physics.

**A physical phenomenon is fundamental units of matter changing their positions in space**

Objects are simply indivisible fundamental units of matter arranged in a particular way and in a particular part of space.

Therefore, a moving object is simply “indivisible fundamental units of matter changing their positions in space.” (“At Time 1, atoms were in Position 1. At Time 2, atoms were in Position 2.”)

Questions

1. When an object A hits another object B, why does object B move?
2. Why is the movement of object B not random?

**The changes of position of moving objects are not random**

The changes in the position of moving objects follow a pattern. These are predictable and observable.

**The movement of matter if not random because it follows a law.**

Laws of physics govern the behavior of objects.

Questions

1. Are the laws of physics physical themselves? Do the laws of physics take up space or weigh anything?
2. What is the relationship between the laws of physics and the objects governed by them?
3. How do laws keep objects in order?

**Physical phenomena is distinct from the laws that govern them**

Indivisible fundamental units are not enough to explain their predictable behavior. Laws, which are distinct from these fundamental units provide a complete explanation of physical phenomena.

**The laws of physics are not physical**

The laws of physics do not take up space.

**A physical phenomenon is a series of states**

State 1 is followed by state 2. Each state is a particular arrangement of indivisible units of matter. The change between one state and another is not random. This change follows the laws of physics.

**Preceding states determine future states by means of the laws of physics**

State 1 is the input of output State 2.

**The laws of physics is a function from which an input state produces an output state**

**The physical universe follows an abstract formula: Input state + laws of physics → output state**

**An output state becomes an input state that the physical universe uses to churn a new output state**

1. What *connects* the physical states to the laws?

Why aren’t the physical states completely separated from the laws? What’s the glue between the laws and the physical states?

2. How do the laws of physics “know” the state of the universe? Why doesn’t the universe “get it wrong” when determining future states?
3. *How* are states treated as inputs? What’s the format?

**We can have abstract information about concrete physical states**

**Information is the glue that allows abstract laws of physics to interact with physical states**

The laws of physics uses information about physical states to produce output states.

**Information about a physical state, not the physical state itself, is the input that the laws of physics use to produce outputs.**

Is knowledge and information the same?

**Knowledge about a physical object is not the same as the physical object itself**

There’s a categorical difference between a physical object and our knowledge about the object. A physical object takes up space, while our knowledge of a physical object does not take up space. Also, our knowledge of a physical object is not embedded in the physical object. Our knowledge about a physical object is abstract.

**The theory of indirect interaction doesn’t require a particular answer for the metaphysical status of information**

Information does not imply consciousness. Our knowledge of something is in our mind. We can have a conscious experience of it. However, the universe does not need internal experience of knowing information about physical states. The universe is like a computer which can process information without having an internal experience of it.

TO DO

- Familiarize yourself with the discussions surrounding AI.

**A mental state is an output of the universal function generated with the correct input**

**An input from a certain ontological category could produce an output in an entirely different ontological category in the universal function**

**The universal function could receive input and generate outputs from and for all ontological categories (mental, physical, etc.)**

**When physical states change, the information inputed into the universal function changes, producing corresponding mental states**

It is not the physical state that generates mental phenomena. It’s information about the physical state that gets inputed into the universal function.

**Indirect interaction implies that brains do not secrete consciousness**

It is not the special atoms in the brain that produces consciousness. It is their arrangement and information about them that produces consciousness.

**The arrangement of the indivisible units of matter that compose the brain and information about this arrangement that gets processed in the universal function produces consciousness**

**Indirect interaction implies that atoms are not conscious**

Physical phenomena, the brain, the indivisible units of matter are not conscious since they do not generate consciousness.

**Physical states can affect mental states and vice versa**

Some desired states require the correct physical and mental state inputs

Example: placebo effect. A pill (physical) + belief (mental) = Placebo effect

**The laws of physics should be called the laws of the universe to include governance over mental phenomena**

If some mental states are volitional and they are used as an input into the universal function, they could produce an entirely different output characterized by the use of free will.

**Indirect interaction does not require the existence of free will**

The mechanics of indirect interaction gives us a concrete mechanism for minds to affect the world, whether that mind is controlling its mental states or is merely a predetermined output of the universal function.

**Indirect interaction allows emergence theory**

If might be the case that the universe began with only physical phenomena and laws. Then, over time, as matter rearranged itself, a pattern of information yielded the very first conscious output. If this actually happened, then other types of emergence might also be waiting to come into existence with the correct informational input.

**Indirect interaction works even if we think of mental states as epiphenomena of physical states**

It might be that the physical state of the brain entirely determines mental states. Mental phenomena can be purely epiphenomenal. Indirect interaction simply gives a causal mechanism for brain to affect mind.

**Indirect interaction could be causally one-directional or two-directional**

**Indirect interaction can be consistent with idealism**

If the laws of the universe govern only mental phenomena, because that’s all that exists, it might be that the underlying mechanics are the same: state + information + laws -> output.

**The interaction problem has lasted for so long because philosophers are looking for consciousness inside the brain**

You can’t find mental states like consciousness in the brain. You can only find correlating physical states. You can’t observe the interaction between mind and brain because their relationship is abstract. Information about a physical state cannot be found within the physical state.
