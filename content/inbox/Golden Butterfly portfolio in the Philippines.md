# Golden Butterfly portfolio in the Philippines

To experiment with investing in the [[Philippine Stock Exchange Index ]] (PSEI), I’m going to invest P40,000 out of my P140,000 emergency fund.

Instead of the original [[Golden Butterfly portfolio]], I am going to use the [[Modified Golden Butterfly portfolio with no gold]], which uses the following asset allocation:

- 20% Total World Stock Market
- 20% Total World Small Cap Value
- 20% Long-term Bonds
- 20% Short-term Bonds
- 10% TIPS
- 10% REITS

In the Philippines, a possible portfolio (with funds to use) to mimic this within the Philippine economy is the following:

- 40% (P16,000) FMETF: Because of the [[Problems with mutual funds]], I choose to invest on stocks via the [[FMETF ]], the only ETF in the country. Unfortunately, I am unable to invest in the small cap value index in the Philippines without investing in mutual funds or complicating my system.
- 20% (P8,000) Long-term Bonds: (For now this can’t be invested on as [[Bonds.ph]] does not accept new applicants.)
- 20% (P8,000) Short-term Bonds: (For now this can’t be invested on as Bonds.ph does not accept new applicants.)
- 20% (P8,000) REIT: Because there are no TIPS in the Philippines, I'll be investing 20% of my portfolio entirely to [[REIT]]. Here, I use [[ARIET]] or Ayala REIT.
