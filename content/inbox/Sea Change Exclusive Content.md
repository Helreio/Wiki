# *Getting Started With Sea Change*

When I started my sea change, more than seven years ago, there were a thousand things I wanted to change about my life.

I was overweight, addicted to junk food and smoking, deeply in debt and struggling to make ends meet, disorganized, cluttered, unproductive, sedentary, too busy for my family, unhappy. To name just the major problems.

But I couldn’t make changes, no matter how hard I tried. I’ve since learned that it’s not just a matter of how much effort you put into it, but a matter of doing it in the most effective way possible.

Making 10 changes at once is not effective, I’ve found, through my experiments. The most effective method is what I’m going to recommend for anyone starting the Sea Change Program: pick one change.

It doesn’t matter what change you pick, though I do have a few recommendations. What matters is that you pick one, and even if there are 4-5 you really want to do right now, right away, just randomly pick one. Which one are you most excited about? Which one will you enjoy most? Pick that. If there are a few that are tied, choose randomly. You’ll get to the others.

So today, pick a change you can make this month. The only absolute requirements:

1. **You have to pick just one**, and focus on that.

2.**You can only do it for 5 minutes a day**. That’s the maximum. There’s no minimum time, other than you have to at least start.

In addition, here are some of my best recommendations:

- **Pick something that’s positive** (a new good habit) rather than quitting a bad one. You’ll get to the bad ones later, but they’re harder. Let’s start with something easy.
- **Pick something you enjoy**. This is actually really important. Many people make changes because they think they should. And you can do some of those later. But for now, find something that you actually look forward to doing because you enjoy it. If you want to exercise, for example, find an activity that’s fun (and perhaps social).
- **Pick something that’s easy to start**. If it requires buying a bunch of new equipment or clothes or driving 10 minutes to do, it’s too hard to start. If you can do it at home or in your office at a certain time each day, then it’s much easier. You should be able to do it right now, or in the next 10 minutes, or it’s probably not easy enough to start.

So today, just pick something. Don’t worry, you won’t be married to it for life. You’re just going to use it to learn about change. And once you learn about effective principles of change, you can change anything.

# *Sea Change: Practicing the Skill of Change*

Changing something in your life, and having it stick, is a skill that most people aren’t good at. But it can be learned and practiced until you are good at it.

I’ve spent years practicing it myself, but in truth, I got decent at it within about six months of practicing it. The first few changes I made with this method stuck, and the more changes I made over time, the better I got at it.

What we’re after is not just the ability to make a change — anyone can do that — but to have it be a lasting change that will be a part of your life for as long as you want it to be.

You’ve already [picked one change to start with](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/sea-change-start/) — now let’s start practicing it.

**1. Pick a trigger**. A trigger for a habit is a physical event that immediately precedes the habit and sets off your urge to do the habit. Some examples might be stress as a trigger for smoking, or eating breakfast as a trigger for brushing your teeth, or waking up as a trigger for checking your email. You’ll learn more about triggers as you practice, but for now, pick a trigger that happens everyday without you having to consciously remember. Some examples include waking up, eating breakfast, eating lunch, eating dinner, brushing your teeth, arriving at work, drinking your first cup of coffee, leaving work, arriving home, going to bed, etc. Pick one for your new change.

**2. Commit to practicing it every day this month**. Tell a bunch of people about it, and ask them to hold you accountable. You can do this through Facebook, email, blogs, Twitter, our forum, or just physically telling people in your life. Fully commit to the change — don’t half do it or it won’t be important to you.

**3. Put visual reminders somewhere where you’ll see it when the trigger happens**. If your trigger is eating breakfast, put a note or some other cues in the area where you eat breakfast. You want to remember each time the trigger happens.

**4. Practice doing the new change**. Each time the trigger happens (ideally once per day), do the new change. It will have to be done very very consciously at first, but it will get easier to remember.

**5. Try to string together a bunch of days**. Mark your successful days on your calendar or on a log or do a journal in our forum. You should try to get as many consecutive successful days as possible.

**6. Enjoy the habit**. Don’t just do it to check it off your list or to get it done. Do it and enjoy it, so that you look forward to it each day, or your won’t stick to it for long.

That might seem like a lot of steps, but once you’ve picked a trigger and committed, it’s really just a matter of doing the change each day right after the trigger, and enjoying doing it.

So pick a trigger and commit to it today, and get to practicing! You’ll likely encounter a few problems, but we’ll learn how to deal with them as we practice. And through the practice, we’ll start to get good at changing anything about our lives.

# *The 9 Habits that Create Massive Change*

Always remember that the future comes one day at a time. **~Dean Acheson**

*Editor’s note: This is a guest article by Scott Dinsmore of* [*Live Your Legend*](http://www.liveyourlegend.net/)** **.**

Most life changes are simple to make.

Not at all easy, but quite simple.

Yet change continues to be one of the most challenging human actions on the planet.

And lasting change, well that’s an altogether bigger and stronger beast.

Buy why?

**Why is the formula for losing weight, for example, so basic (eat real food, eat a little less of it and work out a little more), yet the majority of our country (and much of the world) is obese?**

This puzzle has always blown my mind.

Over the past ten or fifteen years I’ve made a pretty deep study on change, motivation and what influences behavior. Granted, the majority of the tests have been on myself, but the results have been pretty powerful.

In fact what I’ve learned has allowed me to experience change in a way I would have never thought possible.

Some big changes include: switching from a meat-every-meal diet to mostly vegan, becoming a barefoot ultra-marathon runner, losing 20% of my body fat, building a career around helping people in a way I truly love, starting two successful businesses including a [highly-trafficked blog](http://liveyourlegend.net/), becoming fluent in a second language, overcoming a fear of the ocean, learning to mediate and winning a few Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu tournaments.

In looking at these accomplishments, I noticed a process, a handful of actions and habits, consistent in most all my change. And as I began to study more of the world, I noticed that most these habits were not unique to me (surprise, surprise). Most people who’ve been successful in making meaningful change, seem to do the same.

I’d like to share them with you with the hopes that they’ll be as powerful for you as they have been for me.

### The 9 habits for change

**1. Write down what inspires you.** Nine years ago I spent a summer studying at the London School of Economics. The culture and approach to life and the world was night and day from the U.S. What specifically stood out was meeting some people with jobs who really inspired me. One worked as a security consultant for the U.K. Government. Another studied Kung Fu in Shaolin. The list went on. As I came across these inspiring lives, I started to write them down in my notebook. Usually a paragraph or two (sometimes more or less) about what they did and what about it made me want that job.

From then on I wrote down every job and person that inspired me. Over the years I had complied a huge list of interests and possible career paths. This later had everything to do with me finding the work I am most passionate about at [Live Your Legend](http://liveyourlegend.net/). Our minds can only process so much bouncing around inside our own head. Ideas have to be given room to grow and thrive. Take constant note of what inspires you.

**2. Start very small.** A few years ago I started to get pretty interested in barefoot running. I had been a runner for years and was able to run 5-10 miles without much trouble. But when I picked up my first pair of Vibram barefoot shoes, I was given a huge warning to ease into it. The inclination was to strap them on and take off for another five or ten miles. But instead I started small. Very small. The first day I walked around in them for an hour. Then I jogged a quarter mile. Then a little more.

A friend of mine took another approach. He had recently completed an Iron Man (which includes a full marathon as the finish), so he made his first barefoot run a typical 8-miler. He had to stop after four, and the blisters and pain were so bad he couldn’t run for over a week. That was his first and only barefoot day.

Meanwhile I continued to slowly build up my miles. Over time I eased into a 32-mile ultra-marathon in the mountains for Lake Tahoe.

Frustration can kill most change before it even starts. I don’t care how confident or experienced you think you are, start as small as possible and build momentum.

**3. Get completely immersed.** Ever since I was about 11 years old I’d studied Spanish. I even took advanced Spanish in high school and had a minor in it in College. The problem was, after ten years of study, I couldn’t speak my way out of a paper bag.

Then I moved to Sevilla, Spain to live with a family for five months. They didn’t know more than three words of English. The first few weeks were absolutely brutal. But by the time I left, I could hold a conversation in most any situation, and I loved it. I was even dreaming in Spanish. And I didn’t take a single Spanish ‘course’ while I was there. I was just in a situation where the task at hand was a requirement. And it didn’t hurt that we spent most our nights drinking sangria, dancing and eating some of the best food I’d tasted…

Put yourself in a sink-or-swim situation and most of us will start paddling.

**4. Write down dreams.** In 2007 I attended Warren Buffett’s annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. He’d always been a model of mine, and my best friend and I wanted to experience it live. The weekend blew our minds. We spent three days inundated with people deeply passionate about Mr. Buffett’s style of business and his values-based approach to life. It was incredibly refreshing, especially given the type of people I was used to finding in most every other area of finance. It opened us up to a whole new world.

On the flight home we were literally bubbling with ideas and excitement. On that flight we told ourselves “One day we are going to build an investment business like so many of the inspiring people we met had done.” For the next four hours we mapped out the vision. Exactly what we thought the company would look like and all the reasons it was so important to us. We left that flight on cloud nine. The vision was incredible. We had no specific date of when we’d start, but we did have the idea, and that was all we cared about.

You know how long it took that life-time vison to become a reality? Less than a year from the day we stepped off that flight from Omaha. W’ve now been running our investment partnership for just over three years. When we first mapped out the vision, there was no timeline, and yet it ended up happening decades earlier than we would have expected.

It’s nearly impossible to stop an idea or vision once it’s caught fire. But you first must let it catch. Dream big. Write down what you want. I don’t care how crazy the idea is. Give it attention. Let it grow and watch what happens.

**5. Find someone you know you can beat.** Three years ago I got a call from a family friend asking me to join him for an Escape from Alcatraz swim – he wanted to swim 1.4 miles in the 56-degree San Francisco Bay from Alcatraz Island to the mainland. There was no way. I wasn’t a good swimmer, I hated cold water and I’d been deathly scared of deep dark water ever since I saw the *Jaws* movies when I was about seven.

Then I was told one more thing about the swim that changed my mind in an instant.

My friend’s 11-year old son was going to be swimming with us, and so were 60 other kids between 9 and 13 years old. The event was designed to get kids to expand their belief of what’s possible, and there was no way I was going to sit on the sidelines in fear while kids who were half or a third my age were excitedly doing it. Obviously if a 9-year-old could make the swim, then I could too!

We all know those unsuspecting people who have finished that race, quit that job or lost those pounds, whom we know we could outperform. There are examples everywhere of people with less opportunity, fewer resources and more of the deck stacked against them than you, who still manage to move mountains. Find them. Join them. And prevail together.

Btw, the swim was amazing – and this will be my third consecutive year!

**6. Take the pressure off.** I’m convinced that part of the reason why it’s so hard make changes like quitting smoking, losing weight, running a marathon or becoming a vegetarian, is because the world continues to reinforce how hard it is. The endless news stories of obesity and health problems, or even the talk about “the wall” people hit around mile 18 of a marathon.

The more we can disconnect from these mainstream ideas, the more likely we are to get results. This is why the road less traveled seems to be so powerful. The harder it is to compare to typical standards, the less pressure there’ll be and the more likely you’ll stick to something.

Last year my friends and I decided to run what we called “The Accidental Marathon”. We mapped out a course on Google Pedometer, picked a morning and five of us just started running. The only rule was either we finish together or no one finishes. This was not a race. It was an experiment. We’d done little training and half the group had never run more than 13 miles. But we were out there to have fun. We took pictures and videos, stopped for the occasional Snickers and Gatorade, and took in the gorgeous San Francisco day.

And then at a hair under 5 hours, we all crossed the finish line. There was no “wall” or any of the other hype you hear about these long runs. We just went out to have fun. No pressure. No psyching ourselves out. Just fun.

**7. Prove yourself wrong.** Most people don’t do things either because they don’t think they are capable of it or they don’t think they should. The more of these personal assumptions we can test, the better. As it turns out, most things we believe about ourselves (and even about the world) can usually be proven otherwise if we let them.

My whole life I’ve been a massive meat eater. Three meals a day had to have meat or I wouldn’t be full. That was my belief. Then one day I decided to see what I might be missing. I was challenged to go vegan for 10 days, so I accepted. I was convinced I’d starve.

I was dead wrong.

Not only did I not get hungry during the ten days, but I finished it feeling amazing. My whole life I had convinced myself of something that simply wasn’t true – that I needed meat to be full. I then began to learn all I could about the health benefits of eating mainly plants and I’ve been mostly vegan ever since. I’ve also gone back to some of my vegetaria friends to apologize for my lack of understanding in the past ;).

Realize your beliefs are not always correct. Be open to being wrong.

**8. Surround yourself with people doing the impossible.** Environment is absolutely everything. For years I’d had a dream of having an online business where I could write and help people, and get paid to do it from anywhere in the world (not a bad dream, right?). So I created a website and started writing. Then I waited for the magic to happen…

For the next four years I proceeded to make exactly zero progress. I managed to get 111 followers the first year (mostly friends and family who were just doing me a favor). Four years later the number was unchanged. I almost shut the site down.

But then I moved to San Francisco and started to make some new friends. A couple included Corbett Barr and our very own Leo Babauta. Then I met dozens more. I saw these people had literally built the type of businesses I’d dreamed of. I started hanging around with my new friends as much as I could – grabbing beers, doing workouts, having dinners and Skype sessions. All of a sudden having one of these businesses not only seemed possible, but it actually became the norm.

You know what happened in the next six months? My site grew by 10x. And less than two years from meeting these people, it had grown by over 160x, and had turned into a real business.

**Environment. Is. Everything.**

Get this right and the rest will follow.

If you notice, every one of the above habits comes down to surrounding yourself with the passionate people who turn the impossible into your new normal.

If you want to lose 40 pounds but everyone around you is massively overweight, you hardly have a chance. If you want to do work you love, but all your co-workers want to put their forehead through their computer monitor, odds are you’ll want to do the same.

If the people around you don’t support and inspire your dreams, then find new friends. There is no other way.

The fastest way to start doing things you don’t think can be done, is to start hanging around people already doing them.

### Remember, change is simple.

It’s no doubt incredibly challenging, but it’s still simple.

Combine a proven process with a group of people who elevate you to a new level, and over time the results will become obvious.

# *Finding Regular Inspiration for Change*

It’s really amazing how reading, watching and hearing about the stories of others can inspire us to change.

As a writer, there are times when I get discouraged, lose focus, get bored … but reading interviews with other writers, or articles or novels by great writers, can inspire me to start writing immediately. It’s lightning, able to energize you and power your change.

The trick is finding the lightning, and capturing it when you find it.

Inspiration works for any kind of change, by the way — not just writing. I’ve used the inspiration of others to help me lose weight, quit smoking, start (and keep) running, run my first marathon, get out of debt, and more. These days, my trouble is too much inspiration! Sometimes I have to resist doing something just because I’ve read an inspiring account of someone else doing something really amazing.

So use inspiration to keep you motivated throughout whatever change you’re working on.

### Where to Find Inspiration

Some good places to look for inspiration:

- Magazines
- Blogs by others going through your change
- Books about or by others who’ve made the same change
- Online forums related to your change
- Social media such as Facebook, Twitter & Google+ … follow others doing the same thing as you, or those who’ve done it

### Harnessing the Inspiration Regularly

Once you’ve found places to get your inspiration, you’ll want to incorporate it into your change on a regular basis, to keep yourself motivated and fueled.

Some ideas:

- Subscribe to blogs by others who are making the change, and either read them in your email regularly, or get into the habit of using an RSS reader (such as [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader/) ) regularly.
- Become an active participant in a forum related to your change. The key is to be regular and active. For example, I use [Fitocracy.com](http://fitocracy.com/) for fitness motivation. (Use the invitation code “zenhabits” if you want to join Fitocracy.)
- When you feel yourself slipping, go to a set of bookmarks you’ve created for inspiration.
- Follow people or blogs who inspire you using your favorite social media platform.
- Join (or create) a group of people who motivate and encourage each other. For example, there are runners’ groups in many areas. Form a writers’ group. Get a group of friends together to train for a triathlon or a 5K.

# *How I Wrote The Effortless Life Publicly*

I woke up one day while on vacation on Guam, with an idea in my mind: The Effortless Life.

I’d been tossing around some ideas in my head for months that I wanted to tie together: ancient ideas of letting go of goals and expectations, living mindfully, simplifying, living in the flow of things.

The phrase “The Effortless Life” struck me as perfect, as the exact unifying idea I was looking for.

I was super excited. I instantly opened a new Google Doc, started a quick rough outline of the book, which I wanted to keep short and simple.

I even started writing the intro, then looked up into the right corner of the document. There was the blue “Share” button. For some reason, I clicked on it, and wondered what would happen if I shared it publicly.

What would happen if I allowed everyone to watch me write the book? Then I noticed another option: Anyone with access CAN EDIT.

Now that was an interesting idea.

What if I allowed everyone in the world to edit the book as I wrote it? Maybe they would add contributions that would be better than my own. Maybe the book would be improved by the group writing process.

At the very least, it would be interesting. And there was really no downside — if it didn’t work, I really was no worse off than where I already was, but I would have learned a lot in the process.

So I tried it, and announced it on Twitter and Google+. The response was instantly enthusiastic. People by the dozens came to watch me write, and as I wrote, I could see their different-colored cursors wandering around the text. On the side, there were comments, and people were saying, “This is so cool! I can see Leo typing!”

Then they started to edit, and I suggested some rules — to prefer subtraction over addition. Delete rather than add stuff, unless what you wanted to add really really added something important. They listened, and for the most part, the additions were very useful, and the subtractions were intelligent. I was pleasantly surprised.

I wrote like crazy. The effect of having people watch you write is absolutely powerful. As writers, we write in isolation — the act of writing is a solitary one. But I transformed it to a public act. It can be a bit distracting at first, but also it motivates you to write quickly.

I wrote a ton that first day. At least half the book. I pulled material from previous posts, edited them, added new chapters, all while people were reading, watching me write, editing, and commenting. It was chaotic but so much fun.

Writing publicly motivated me to write quickly. I wrote half the book the first day, but only had an hour to write the second day (we had family engagements) but then mostly finished the book on the third day. Later I added a couple more chapters, but most of the book was written on the first three days.

### How I Wrote the Book Publicly

Here are the steps I took, in case you want to follow them:

1. Start a new Google Doc. Name it.
2. Write a short outline of chapters, plus an introduction.
3. Create some rules for your fellow contributors to follow. Be clear that this book will be published and sold, without compensation to the contributors. Create a section at the end where they can add their names if they like.
4. Share the document publicly, and allow anyone to edit.
5. Announce it on Twitter, Google+, Facebook, your blog.
6. Start writing, have fun.
7. Interact with others in the comments on the side, plus on social media.
8. Write like crazy. Keep the chapters short and fast.
9. Incorporate older material where appropriate, but rewrite.
10. When you think it’s done, close public participation. Shut off the public sharing, and announce that the public period is closed so that you can make final edits.
11. Read through the book, see if changes need to be made.
12. Hire a copyeditor to clean up the text.
13. Hire a designer, or do design/layout yourself.
14. Publish the book. I published it using the pay-what-you-see-fit model (see below).

### What I Learned

An encapsulation of some of the lessons I learned in this experiment:

The editing/contributions will be chaotic. It takes some getting used to. You have to learn to let go of control, and live with the distractions.

1. One of the biggest problems I faced was how to edit the book once I was done writing it, and had closed off public sharing/editing. While you can compare revisions in Google Docs, you can’t easily see what changes were made in dozens of revisions. This is a problem with Google Docs being used by such a large group. I couldn’t tell what had been changed — maybe something important had been deleted? I was stuck for a few months because I didn’t want to take on the grueling task of comparing dozens of revisions.
2. My solution: accept the wisdom of the group editing process, and just take whatever changes had been made by the last revision. So I just read the book over, and it seemed fine. I had a copyeditor go over it, and she had very few changes. It saved me a lot of headaches when I decided to just accept things as they were.
3. Converse with people as you write. It’s part of the public writing process, and it makes a group activity more fun. It’s also good for you to talk with people and set up some ground rules and expectations as they help out.
4. Writing publicly is very scary, very exciting, very motivating. I’ve never wrote more quickly.
5. People are really smart. We tend to think of the “crowd” as being dumb, but I haven’t found that to be the case.
6. I wrote some Zen Habits posts this way too, publicly, but closed editing so that people could watch but not edit. I allowed them to make suggestions as I wrote, via Google+, so there was interaction. This isn’t a bad model either, though less exciting.

I highly recommend that every writer with a decent audience give this a try. It can’t hurt to see what happens, and if you don’t like it, you can scrap it. But if you do like it, it can transform your writing and interaction with your audience. If you don’t have an audience, perhaps ask some friends or fellow writers to join you for some writing fun.

### The Pay-What-You-See-Fit Payment Model

When I published the book, I decided to try a pricing experiment — let people pay whatever they wanted. I used [e-junkie.com](http://e-junkie.com) as a shopping cart, and within e-junkie you can allow people to change the price. I set a suggested price of $16.95, but allowed people to change the price to whatever they wanted — including zero!

What I learned:

1. Some people will get the thing for free. That’s OK — they might not have bought it if you charged $10, so you get your book into a lot of people’s hands. They’re grateful for the free book, and are more likely to support you in the future.
2. Most people — the vast majority — will pay something. Some only paid 99 cents, others paid $1.99 or $2.99, but many paid $12 or the full price or sometimes a bit more. The average payment was about $5.50, even including all the free downloads.
3. I sold more books (not including the free downloads) than ever before. In the first few months, I outsold any other book I’ve ever sold. This was an incredibly successful.
4. By letting people set their own price, you’re effectively doing an experiment where you see what people really want to pay. Most of us selling books have no idea what people would want to pay, so this is a very enlightening experiment.
5. While some people do get the book for free, you have to let go of any resentment against these people. I honestly was happy that they got the book. I got a lot of messages from people who are poor and/or live in Third World countries where $1 is a lot of money for them, so if the book were for sale they would not have been able to afford it. My goal as a writer is not to make tons of money, but to help people. As a side benefit, I actually made a lot of money this way.

I highly recommend this method for every writer. It might be the only way I publish books in the future. I tried to change some of my old books to this pricing scheme but for some reason when I tried it, the price for the book was set at $0, not my suggested price. I can’t figure out why, but I’ll figure it out someday.

# *Habits You Shouldn’t Start With*

::I’ve long advocated starting very very small when creating new habits.:: Unfortunately, a lot of people pick tough habits, fail, and can’t understand why they don’t have any discipline. So in this article, we’ll look at habits you *shouldn’t* choose when learning to create habits.

The reason you shouldn’t choose these habits is that they’re more difficult. When you learn a skill — and forming habits is definitely a skill — you start with the easy version of that skill, not the hard version. When you learn to ski, you go on the beginner’s slope, not the advanced slope, or you’ll break your neck. When you learn carpentry, you learn to hammer nails and saw boards, not build a house on your first day — or the house will collapse.

::So start with the easy stuff. Skip the hard stuff, for now. **You’ll get to the advanced habit skills later**.::

Here’s the list, with brief explanations:

- **::Waking early::** — this is a difficult habit because 1) changing your body’s sleep patterns is very difficult, and lots of people fail to be consistent about waking early; and 2) the trigger is an alarm clock, which is not a natural trigger in your daily routine. If you do choose this habit for a 2nd or 3rd habit change (not your first one), do just 5-10 minutes earlier at first, then increase by 5-10 minutes as your body adjusts.
- **::Quitting a bad habit::** — whether it’s smoking or biting your nails or drinking or criticizing someone, quitting a bad habit is one of the most advanced habits there is. That’s because 1) there are usually multiple triggers instead of just one, and 2) you have strong urges to do the bad habit, and that’s tough to beat. It’s not impossible, but definitely not a beginner habit skill.
- **::Thinking habits::** — things like negative thinking, or anger, or positive thinking. The problem is that we’re often unaware of our thoughts, so it’s more difficult to change them. Not impossible by any means, but not the easiest of habit skills.
- ::**Habits that take longer than 5 minutes**.:: Some habits can’t be done in 5 minutes — if you’re revising a screenplay, for example, you might be able to just do 5 minutes, but if you have a deadline that won’t be enough, so you’ll want to do more — maybe 30 or 60 minutes. That’s not ideal for the first habit. Instead, choose to do some freewriting or write part of a blog post for 5 minutes.
- **::Habits with too frequent, or too infrequent triggers::** — ::the best trigger for your first few habits is exactly once a day, and one that is already in your daily routine.:: If you do a trigger many times throughout the day (like checking email), it’s hard to consistently remember to do the habit. If you do something only on weekends, or 2 or 3 times a week, that’s not often enough to build the habit in 4-6 weeks. It would take longer, and a very strong focus.
- **::Habits with inconsistent triggers::** — Some triggers are not regular at all, such as someone criticizing you — that might happen today, or it might not happen for a few days. If you aren’t sure if the trigger will happen exactly once every single day, don’t choose that trigger.
- **::Habits with triggers that aren’t already in your daily routine::** — let’s say you want to choose a trigger like “after I do yoga” but you don’t already do yoga every single day … that’s not a solid enough trigger for your new habit. If you want to set an alarm for your trigger, but that alarm doesn’t already go off every day, that’s not a good trigger. Then you’re basically creating two habits at once — setting the alarm, and doing the new habit.
- **::Habits you dislike doing::** — if you dislike running or meditation or mowing the lawn, don’t choose those for this first habit. Choose something you really enjoy doing, so there’s positive feedback built in. You can form the harder habits later, but for now, when you’re just starting out, make it very easy on yourself.

So what habits should you choose? Habits that are:

1. ::positive::

# *How to Land a Print Book Contract*

It had always been my dream to become a published author. The day I got a contract for a print book, from a major publisher, I was on top of the world.

The day I saw my name on the cover of a real book, [The Power of Less](http://thepowerofless.com/) – I was in heaven.

However, aside from the joys of the ego, getting a print book deal is a great idea for any blogger — both in terms of an income stream and getting more exposure for you and your blog. I would never have gotten my book deal for The Power of Less if it hadn’t been for the success of my blog — yet another example of why building the foundation of readership will lead to many opportunities to grow your income. Zen Habits had more than 20K subscribers when I started shopping my book around, and about 25K when I finally got my contract.

When my blog started taking off, it proved that I had something to say that people wanted to hear — this is pure gold to a publisher. It also showed that I knew how to write well, and that I knew how to market myself online — something most traditional print publishers know nothing about. So book publishers and agents started emailing me, asking if I was interested in writing a book.

Of course I was. I signed with one of the agents after doing some research, then wrote a book proposal. My agent shopped the proposal around to a number of potential publishers, and several made me an offer. I went with the highest offer and best match.

That turned out to be the easy part — actually writing the book, then going through the editing and layout and design process, was much harder. And marketing the book, including doing late night radio interviews all through the night (I live on Guam, and U.S. morning radio shows are on in the middle of the night on Guam), writing a ton of guest posts, and doing a ton of print media interviews — was a full-time job. It wore me out.

It was all worth it. Many people heard about Zen Habits who never would have without the book and its publicity, and my blog just continued to grow at an even faster rate. I’m not in love with doing print books, but it was an opportunity that paid off incredibly for me.

**Pros and Cons**

Let’s go over the pros and cons of getting a book deal, in case they aren’t all obvious.

Pros:

- You get a nice fat check when you sign the contract.
- You gain authority as an expert – a published author seems a little more credible than a blogger.
- You gain a wider audience – many people who read books might never have heard of your blog.
- You get opportunities for interviews, guest posts, and other publicity that you never would have without being a published author.
- Your blog’s traffic will grow at an even faster rate.

Cons:

- It’s a long and arduous process, getting a contract and writing the book and going through the editing process and getting the book printed and then … gasp … the marketing. It’s really a lot of work, especially compared to publishing your own ebook.
- Marketing the book is a full-time job, taking time away from your blog — which means your blog content and readers will suffer a bit. It’s hard to do both a blog and a book at the same time.
- Well, there aren’t too many cons. It’s almost all upside – worth doing!

**Key Steps to Getting the Book Deal**

I outlined the things that led to my getting a book deal above, but let’s go over those steps, and I’ll expand a bit on each one.

1. **Build the foundation**. The rest of the stuff on this list matters naught unless you build this foundation first. Write amazing content, be insanely useful, help people solve problems, and market your blog with more amazing content elsewhere (guest posts, Twitter, etc.). Grow your readership and prove your usefulness and marketability. Once you do this, you might just have the publishers knocking on your door.
2. **Do some research**. Look at what other books are out there on your topic — you want to be different from them somehow, put a twist on what’s been done before, be even more useful if possible. Check out the titles of these books and start brainstorming your own title — it doesn’t have to be the same as your blog (though it can be). Start writing up an outline for what should be in the book — what are you going to teach the reader, what problem are you going to solve, and how are you going to do it? Give careful attention to chapter titles — each chapter solves a sub-problem of the book’s main problem, and should have a good title.
3. **Write the proposal**. I just followed (roughly) a couple of suggested outlines for book proposals I found through Googling “book proposal”. There are a handful of good formats out there, but no single format that you need to follow. Basically, it’s a pitch that will show that you are going to write something amazing, that you know how to reach readers, and that you have great ideas for marketing the book.
4. **Get an agent**. The proposal will help get the agent. Shop around, do some research, talk to bloggers who have gotten book deals and see who they used. Contact the agent with a brief pitch — who you are, how successful you’ve been on your blog, your idea for a book, etc. If the agent shows interest, send over the proposal. It’s a good idea to talk on the phone with your potential agent before signing — you want to know if this agent is the right fit for you. Talk to some of the authors she’s represented, if possible, to see what their experiences have been.
5. **Shop the proposal around**. Once you sign with an agent, the agent will help you strengthen your proposal and even the title of your book if necessary. Then she’ll shop the proposal around to publishers who might be interested. If all goes right, you’ll get some offers, and perhaps talk with a couple of the interested publishers, and then you’ll need to choose one.
6. **Sign the deal**. The contract will be based on their offer, but you’ll also need to hammer out little details like the rights to the audio book, etc.
7. **Write the book**. This part ain’t easy. It’s a smart idea to put aside some time, take a break from your blog and even your day job if possible. The blog can go on running if you can line up some guest posts and run some “question” posts (where you pose a question to your readers and ask for answers in the comments). You can even write a few short ones in advance, and or run some classic ones from your archives (be sure to note this if you do republish old ones), and let your blog go on autopilot for the most part. Don’t moderate comments, or ask a blogger friend to do it for you. Hole yourself up, and just focus on writing. No email or social media until you’ve written at least a couple hours a day!!!
8. **Go through a bunch of crap**. After you submit the manuscript, you’re not done. Typically you have to go through some back-and-forth editing with your publisher, and you also need to work with the publisher on the cover design, page design, getting blurbs from other authors for the cover, planning a marketing campaign, and more. Yech.
9. **Market, and market some more**. In the month or two leading up to the launch of your book, you want to build up some anticipation for the launch, and line up guest posts on major blogs, and create a bunch of content to give away to go along with the marketing of your blog. You’ll also be setting up a ton of interviews, if all goes well, and when the launch comes you’ll be working day and night for at least a month or two. Have a blast!

# *Starting Frugally*

When I started Zen Habits, not only did I have zero money to invest in a small business, I was deep in debt. I couldn’t afford to hire a designer, pay for an expensive host, buy software, hire staff, pay for anything really. But I started. I didn’t let my lack of funds slow me down, and in fact I think it’s best to start with free or cheap.

**Start small, and grow your budget only as your audience and income grows.**

This kind of frugality is actually a good thing: you won’t invest money that won’t be paid back, as start-up businesses often do. They put a lot of money into a business before there’s even an income, and often the income doesn’t grow fast enough to repay the investment or debt.

Staying small also means you’re more nimble, adaptable to change. Low overhead means you’re lean, and it takes less revenue to succeed. You’re less susceptible to economic recession as well. So stay lean, even as you grow — the fewer the expenses, the better. Make every expense be completely justified, make every dime count.

### How to Start With Zero

You don’t need any money to be a blogger. Here’s how to get started with no budget:

- Use free blog software and a free host. I started on [Blogger.com](http://Blogger.com), because I felt it was easiest to learn, but these days I recommend [WordPress.com](http://WordPress.com) — it’s professional blogging software that’s free and not hard to learn, and you can expand upon it as you grow, unlike Blogger. Both [WordPress.com](http://WordPress.com) and [Blogger.com](http://Blogger.com) give you free hosting as well. There are other similar services and software out there, including Typepad and Tumblr.
- You don’t need to buy a domain. I didn’t, though eventually I did. However, if there’s one small investment you might make, it would be buying a domain. Not necessary, but at $10 for a year, it’s not too expensive.
- Use free services. I use the free Feedburner for serving up my RSS and email feeds, for example, and have since the early days. There are software packages for bloggers you can buy, but none are necessary.
- Use free blog templates. The free blogging software I mentioned above comes with a set of free design templates already installed, and if you use WordPress software, you can later choose from thousands of great, free WordPress themes. You don’t need a professional designer to get started.
- Use free images. For almost two years, I used Creative Commons licensed photos from Flickr for all my posts. There are lots of great ones, and they’re free. Eventually I switched to paid photos, but they’re not necessary.

There are other examples of free stuff you can use, but that’s pretty much all you need to get started.

### Stay Lean as You Grow

As your blog starts to grow an income, you can start paying for things, but only slowly, and as cheaply as possible.

- Get a cheap host. I used Bluehost after moving from Blogger, and it cost $8 a month. I could justify that because I was making more than that from Google Adsense, so I was still profitable. Dreamhost is another decent cheap host — there are a number of them. These days I pay a lot more for a host, but for well over a year, a cheap host was good enough for Zen Habits. It wasn’t until I had more than a million pageviews a month that I needed a better host.
- Buy a domain. As soon as you can afford it. Again, it’s only $10 a year.
- Use cheap services. I use [e-junkie.com](http://e-junkie.com), for example, to host, serve up, and sell my ebooks and other digital products.
- Give payments on the back end. For my first ebook, I was able to work out a deal with a designer, giving him a small cut of proceeds once the ebooks started selling, as I couldn’t afford to pay him up front.
- Only hire as needed. For a while, I hired a personal assistant to help me keep up with email and comments, as my blog’s traffic took off. Eventually I stopped that, and instead stopped email and comments. It’s better to simplify than to increase your budget.

I’ve since grown my income so that I can pay for more: a better host, a professional designer for my blog, people to help run courses I teach, etc. But at heart, I’m still a cheapskate, and Zen Habits is kept lean and profitable to this day.

# *Laying the Foundation for Your Blog*

You can put Google Adsense ads on your site from Day 1, and you can launch an amazing ebook in the first month of your blog’s existence … but let me spare you the suspense: you won’t make any money doing that.

Why not? Nobody’s reading your blog. Nobody knows who you are, or why they should trust you, or what authority or credibility you have. No one is looking at the ads, because no one is looking at your blog.

Many bloggers start out thinking they can make some money right away, and put up every ad they possibly can. They end up with disappointment.

The missing ingredient is readership. It’s the foundation for making any kind of money off your site.

Now, let me clarify: you shouldn’t gain readers just to make money. There are lots of more important reasons to grow your readership: to help more people, to connect with fantastic folks, to let your means of self-expression reach a wider audience, to grow your credibility, to open up possibilities. And this last one is important: when you grow your readership, you open up even more possibilities.

It wasn’t until I had 26,000 readers that I got a book deal — the readers proved to my publisher that I had something worth saying, and that it was resonating with people. It wasn’t until I had those readers that I made any noticeable money with ads or affiliate links (like Amazon affiliate links). It wasn’t until I had those readers that I sold a best-selling ebook (Zen To Done), or had the chance to write for some of the biggest blogs in the world, or start the A-List Blogging Bootcamps, or successfully launch a couple of other blogs.

A world of opportunities arise when you grow that readership — when you lay that foundation. It’s a platform from which you can launch all kinds of ventures, businesses, products, services. You can do almost anything, but first you need to build that foundation.

We’ll talk later about what you can do once you build that foundation, but right now, let’s look at the most basic thing of all: how to build the foundation.

### Most Important Factor

If you could do only one thing to grow your readership and build that foundation, it would be creating amazing and useful content. In fact, I strongly recommend that almost all your blogging time be spent on creating content, if you don’t have that foundation yet.

You could spend time on other things: checking your stats, putting ads on your site, checking your earnings, emailing, doing social media, responding to comments, adding new widgets and buttons to the site, tweaking the design, instant messaging, and more. There’s lots that goes into blogging … but none of that really matters, as much as creating amazing content.

Why?

To find the answer, you need to get into the head of the reader: why does she visit your site? To admire the great design, or check out all the widgets you’ve added to the sidebar? To admire how much time you’ve spent doing email or Twitter or Facebook or IM? No: the reader comes to check out the content, because the content will help her in some way — by teaching her how to do something, by inspiring or informing or entertaining.

So if the reader is coming for content, that’s what you should be focusing on. The content is what draws new readers and keeps old readers coming back and compels people to subscribe or dig through your archives.

Let’s briefly look at three ways how really useful and powerful content can boost your blog’s traffic:

1. Other bloggers will link to your posts and send their readers your way.
2. Readers who do find you (from other blogs or elsewhere) will find so much use in your content they’ll want to come back, or better yet subscribe so they can get regular updates of your great content.
3. Great content will be shared by readers on delicious, Twitter, StumbleUpon, Digg and other social bookmarking services.

The benefits of great content go far beyond these three things. When readers really love your content, they will bookmark you as a reference and keep coming back. They’ll share the content with their friends via email and social networks. They’ll start to look to you as an authority, ask you questions, buy your ebooks. Great content is the start of amazing things for bloggers.

And the good news is that while it definitely takes hard work creating great content, learning how to do it, isn’t the hardest thing in the world. We’re going to look at some ways you can turn an ordinary blog post into something powerful.

### How to Create Great Content, Briefly

Let’s look at what it takes to create great content that will draw readers.

Let’s start by remembering the goals of great content — you want the readers, and other bloggers, to find your content so useful and powerful that they will link to you, subscribe, bookmark the content, share it with others, and come back again and again.

So with that in mind, what does great content need to be? One or both of the following:

- Something extremely useful.
- Something remarkable.

A great post can be both, or one or the other. For example, I did a post on how to clear out the queues in your life (email inbox, to-do lists, social networks, etc.) and readers found it pretty useful. But a little while before that, I did a post called “Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway (Or, the Privatization of the English Language) — this post wasn’t very useful to readers, but was “remarkable”. It got hundreds of comments, Diggs, Tweets and bookmarks, and was blogged about many times. Being remarkable means saying something that people will take notice of, will talk about, will pass on. It catches people’s attention — not just to be flashy, but to get a conversation going.

Let’s look at how to do both of these things:

**1. Be extremely useful.**

It all starts with the topic of the post. You need to consider your reader, and center the topic of your post on your reader — not on yourself, your ads, your blogger friends, or anyone else but the reader. What are his or her needs, wants, hopes and dreams? What problems does he have in his daily life that you can solve? It helps to get to know your readers, and don’t be afraid to ask them to share their goals, dreams, problems with you. Think about the problems you’ve solved in your life, both personal and professional. Often, if you’re an experienced professional, you forget what it’s like to be just starting out, so you need to think back to the early days of your career and remember the problems you faced, the challenges you had to overcome, the uncertainty and ignorance you had. Remember those, and you have some extremely good post ideas.

Now choose a topic that will solve one of the reader’s problems, help him achieve something he’s always wanted to achieve. Create a resource for him: an extremely useful set of practical tips, links, tools to solve that problem. Again, it’s useful to have a beginner’s mind as you write this guide or resource: what does the absolute beginner need to know? What misconceptions does he have? What practical tips worked for you? What doesn’t work?

The more practical your tips, the better. It’s not enough to say that the keys to losing weight are eating less and exercising more. Those are both difficult things to do. Give the reader extremely useful ways of doing those things, and you’ve created a resource.

Creating extremely useful posts is a skill, but it’s probably the most important skill you’ll develop as a blogger. Read dozens of other extremely useful blog posts to give you some inspiration and guidance — learn from the best. And then imitate them — not in content but in style and depth. It’s in this imitation that you’ll get better. And with practice — writing dozens of in-depth posts of your own — you’ll get good at this skill, and develop your own style and voice.

**2. Be remarkable.**

To be a blogger is to be part of a large conversation that happens not only in the blogging world, but the Internet in general. To be a remarkable blogger is to make a strong contribution to that conversation, to say something worth listening to, to say something others will find worthy of talking about.

Start with bold ideas. Every post starts with an idea — take the idea you come up with for your post, and see if you can make it bolder. Be daring — aim for a big post, not just a regular one. Aim to say something huge, not just what everyone else is saying. Aim for a post that a major blog would link to, and that people will talk about. Get noticed!

Also see if you can take a stance on an issue that others are talking about … but make it something different. Not just different for the sake of being different, but different to be a devil’s advocate, to get people to think outside their normal patterns, to shake things up, to challenge traditional ideas.

Find a way to provide new information, a twist on what’s been done, or a fresh perspective. If you’re just doing what everyone else has done, in exactly the same way, people will yawn at your post.

### Other Factors Besides Content

Creating great content isn’t the only way to grow readership — it’s the most important, but there are other factors. The second most important factor, once you’ve created the content, is spreading the word about your blog. Now that you’ve created amazing content, you need other people to find out about it somehow.

Creating content, and spreading the word — these are the two things you need to focus on to create the foundation of readership. The other factors are extremely minor compared to these two. We’ll look at how to spread the word in the next section, below, but let’s go over a few other minor factors that help build that foundation:

- Design: Important only because you want people to believe you have a professional blog, which helps with your credibility. Why should they read you instead of the thousands of other amateurs posting worthless drivel? Because you have something to say, and you have credibility. Also, bad design distracts from the content — the best design showcases the great content, and makes it easy to find useful content.
- Responsiveness: I don’t do this well on Zen Habits anymore, but in my early days I was very responsive to my readers. I would respond to every comment, every email, and answer the best questions with a full post. Readers like to know that you’re connecting with them.
- Best posts: Readers won’t go through your archives to see whether you’re worth subscribing to — they want to make that decision with a glance down your front page. So they’ll look at your most recent posts, and then look at the sidebar to see your best or most popular posts, to see whether the posts look useful. Be sure that’s easily available in the sidebar, or you’ll lose a lot of potential subscribers.

### Spreading the Word

So you’ve created the great content — how do you get the word out? There are lots of good ways. Here are the best methods:

1. Network with other bloggers your size or preferrably larger. The more bloggers you know, and the better your relationships with them, the better. Make friends by reaching out, complimenting what you like about their blogs, offering to help in some way, offering to do a guest post for them. Help others, and it will come back to you eventually.
2. Do as many guest posts as you can. At least one per week, preferrably 2 or even 3 a week. The more, the better. An aggressive campaign of guest posts will help your blog reach tons of new readers. When you do guest posts, try to follow the above guidelines for extremely useful content. If you don’t, and you make the benefits obscure, the advice vague, and the text rambling, you will have the opposite effect — you’ll scare readers away from your site. If you make the post extremely useful and easy to read, you’ll attract new readers. Once they go to your site, they should find much more of the same kind of great content. Look to do guest posts on blogs with larger readership than yours, but with an audience that will be interested in your content.
3. Social media — focus on Twitter, StumbleUpon and Delicious, but do it in an organic and non-pushy way. Create amazing content and headlines — you need to do both — and you’ll have a greater shot of your posts spreading on these services.

### Growing Without Hype

Look, there are many who have grown rapidly by learning the art of hype. Unfortunately, readers can sense hype, and they begin to grow weary of it. You lose trust when you do too much hype.

I’ve been guilty of hype, and I always regret it. It doesn’t feel authentic, and the boost in popularity you get from it is temporary and empty.

A much better method is growing by helping others. Create great, useful, interesting content, and spread it authentically, through guest posts and growing relationships with other bloggers. Don’t try to “game” social media, or create posts just so they’ll get popular or linked. This is a fool’s game. Really try to help people, without making yourself out to be a god or tearing others down.

It’s possible to grow this way, and you’ll do it without making readers tired of your hype or distrustful of anything you say or do. That’s a good way to build the foundation.

### How Long It Takes

There’s no one answer. I grew pretty rapidly, because I was aggressive about doing guest posts and getting my content and brand out there as often as possible. I probably wouldn’t do it that way again, but my growth would be slower. I’m OK with that.

How fast you grow depends on a lot of factors — how well written your content is, how useful it is, how people perceive you, how well you connect with readers and other bloggers, how often you get out on other blogs doing guest posts and the like … it’s not easy.

I’d say you can’t build a really good foundation of 10K readers in less than 6 months, and for most bloggers, it’ll take much longer. A year or two years, if they’re creating great content. That might seem like a long time, but remember that you’re building a business, a brand, relationships, and trust. That doesn’t happen overnight.

# *How to Simplify by Automating*

As many of you know, I’m a big fan of simplicity. I don’t like doing a million tasks a day when half a dozen important tasks will do. I believe in effectiveness, not cranking out endless tasks and emails.

To that end, I’ve automated a lot of things on my blog and with my business. It’s saved me hours of work and tons of headaches. I’d like to share some things I’ve done, in the hope that it will inspire you. It’s not a step-by-step guide, as not everyone will be able to put these all into practice, but just a series of examples that show it’s possible, and to help you take a look at what you do and how it can be simplified or automated.

**1. Selling ads**.

When I started selling ads on Zen Habits, I set up an automated process. An advertising page on Zen Habits outlined my criteria for ads, as well as the process. I set up a Paypal button so the advertiser could just buy the ad automatically, and gave them a special email address to send the ad image and link url after they bought the ad. All I had to do was add the ad to my site once a month. Note: I don’t sell ads anymore — I simplified further by eliminating.

**2. Selling ebooks**.

My entire ebook selling process is done through [e-junkie.com](http://e-junkie.com) … I upload the ebook to e-junkie, set up a few settings, and then e-junkie handles the rest. Money is deposited in my Paypal account and I don’t have anything to do after that.

**3. Comments**.

Moderating comments can be a hassle — especially with so many spammers these days. I used to use a couple of different WordPress spam plugins, but once I got large enough the spammers got around them. I ended up getting rid of comments, and saved myself a lot of time, but another approach would be to allow readers to mark a comment as spam (several plugins can do this), so you don’t have to do it yourself.

**4. Email filters**.

Don’t spend a lot of time sorting through your inbox. If you get regular types of email that you don’t really need to see, set up filters or rules in your email program (I recommend Gmail) and get those emails out of the inbox automatically. Social media notifications are a good example, although changing the settings for these sites so they don’t send the notifications in the first place is an even better idea. In Gmail, you can also set up filters that will automatically respond to a certain keyword in the subject of an email with a canned response — so anyone asking about guest posts might get an automatic reply about your guest post policies, etc.

**5. Post your policies**.

Another good idea is to post policies on your site, and have them easily found in your sidebar/navigation bar, or on your About or Contact page. Policies could be about anything — advertising, guest posts, commenting, buying ebooks, contacting you, etc. This saves a lot of time answering repeat requests.

**6. Post an FAQ**.

Similar to posting policies, answering Frequently Asked Questions on a page or post on your site is a great idea ( [See the Zen Habits FAQ](http://zenhabits.net/faq/) ). It also helps cut back on answering the same questions over and over.

**7. Set up a guest post login**.

If you regularly accept guest posts, you can do what I did: set up a limited login for WordPress for guest writers, and only give the password out to someone who you’ve accepted to write a guest post. This allows your guest writers to login, put in their post, and format the post as needed. Regarding formatting, also consider using a style guide, as I have on [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.pbworks.com/Zen-Habits-style-guide). It saves a lot of editing.

Anytime you find yourself doing repetitive tasks for your blog or business, ask yourself whether it’s really necessary. Almost 100% of the time, it’s not — you just need to think of how you can automate, eliminate, or preempt those tasks.

Doing these things has made my business and blog almost hassle free, so I can work more on creating powerful content and connecting with friends.

# *How to Make Money from Your Blog with Integrity*

How can you make money from your blog – and keep your readers with integrity?

It’s a common question from bloggers, especially those who are really passionate about their blog: How do you make money from your blog?

I’ve been lucky with Zen Habits: fairly early on, I discovered how to make a living by doing what I’m passionate about, and within a year of starting my blog I quit my day job.

**Making money blogging seems to be a common dream, and also sounds like a bit of a scam.**

It’s a dream, because you can write about what you love, interact with others who love the same thing, and be free to work from anywhere, at your own pace.

It also seems like a scam, because there are millions of bloggers, and very few make any decent money doing it. I’ll be honest: it’s not easy, and it takes talent, skill, hard work, practice, and passion.

Unfortunately, there are many marketers out there who suggest an aggressive way of making sales through one’s blog by plastering ads all over it, or by selling all sorts of stuff that the reader may not like, or using all kinds of hype. I don’t buy it: while I’m sure you can make a lot of money fast by being a marketing hype machine, a spammer and a scammer, you’ll end up with money but no integrity, and people won’t trust you.

**It’s important to maintain your integrity, because after a while, people will figure out whether they trust you or not — and if they don’t trust you, they won’t listen to you.**

I recommend a win-win strategy where you can earn money from your blog, but only promote things that are really useful to your readers and can help them in some way.

### The Problem with Spammy Ads/Products

When I first started Zen Habits, the first thing I did to make money was to put some Google Adsense ads in several spots, because it was the easiest thing to do. Later I experimented with other ad systems, including Yahoo and Chitika ads, but they didn’t work as well.

Adsense is a really easy way to get ads onto your site and to earn a little money right from the beginning. It’s not a lot of money — you might make 30 cents in one day if you have a little traffic, or a few dollars if you have a decent amount of readers, or $10-15/day if you have a lot of traffic.

But eventually I removed Adsense (only last year actually), mostly because I got a lot of complaints from readers that the Adsense ads were either inappropriate, or spam type ads. One reader even asked me whether I had actually tried the products I was advertising (I think it was milk from cloned cows), and I had to honestly say, “No.”

The problem with Adsense, as I saw it, was that I couldn’t actually endorse the products, but here I was, putting them onto my site. And I didn’t feel good about that. It was like making money on selling products that I didn’t really want my readers to use. That wasn’t in line with my values. So, eventually I got rid of Adsense, even though it was a convenient way to get a little income from my blog.

But that’s a big problem with a lot of ways of making money — you are selling products and services you don’t believe in. Readers will do their best to ignore it, but you’re sending a message to them: you’re willing to make money no matter what. You’re spammy. You put money before the readers’ interest.

It’s more important to me to keep my integrity. I want people to trust me, not tune me out because all I’m trying to do is sell them crappy products.

### How to Make Money and Still Keep that Trust

Think about how you interact with your friends: do they try to sell you crappy stuff all the time, just so they can make money off you? Or do you trust them, because they would only recommend something to you they liked, believed in? And remember that crappy friend who kept trying to sign you up for his Amway pyramid scheme? You stopped hanging out with him.

On a blog, it’s much the same: we are building relationships with our readers, and we can either do it by being a good friend, or by being the crappy friend who wants to sell Amway to all his friends.

Only recommend books and products that you really believe in, and don’t just link to them or put ads on your site to make money. Once readers buy a book you recommend and actually like, they’ll enjoy it and come back for more. People trust you if you recommend good things, but if you advertise things that aren’t good, they’ll learn not to trust you.

Some practical ways to do this:

- Sell your own 125×125 ads (or whatever format works best for you). Then you can pick and choose the ads that you actually believe in.
- Sell your own ebooks and other products. If you made them yourself, presumably you believe in them.
- Join ad networks that are careful about screening their ads. Fusion and The Deck are two good examples, but there are others that might be better suited for your blog.
- Use Amazon and other affiliate links, but only link to books & products you actually recommend.

### The Importance of Integrity and Helping Your Readers

For me, integrity is very important. I want to make money from my blog in a way that is useful for my readers, in a way that I feel good about and that’s in line with my values. I want people to trust me, even after I’ve made a little money off them. But everyone is different in this respect. Some bloggers just want to make money — and they do, in any way they can.

I think it’s important to think of your readers, because if you have no integrity with your readers, your readers will know that and they’ll say, “This guy is not really trying to help us, he’s just trying to make us come to his blog in order to make a lot of money.” If you make your blog all about the readers and create a good readership experience for them, create great content for them, put up a design that’s something they enjoy coming to and looking at, and have advertising and other forms of creating income that are actually helpful to them, people will appreciate that – and they’ll keep coming back.

So, if you have a relationship with your readers, you build that with everything that you do. Every email that you send to them, every comment that you answer, every blog post you write, every design change, and every money-making decision that you make is part of the relationship that you’re forming with them.

And if you build a solid relationship, that’s based on trust and respect, good things will come from it — you’ll be able to make a living doing something you’re happy with, not just make a quick buck off unsuspecting readers.

# *How to Find Your Writing Voice*

Many of us have gone through a phase in our lives where we searched for who we are, and how to express ourselves. We experimented with different styles, different philosophies, different clothes and hairstyles and ways of showing the world who we are.

Eventually, we found ourselves, and we learned how to express ourselves to others. This search paid off — it means we’re able to form connections with other people, and to be ourselves at the same time.

As writers, we must go through the same search — learning who we are as writers and how to express that to others is the process of finding your Writing Voice.

And it means a lot: a writer with a unique voice stands out, and is able to connect with people on a much more meaningful level. People feel they know the writer, and they can trust him.

You don’t need to find your voice right away, and it’s not an overnight process … but it’s worth the search.

### What’s Voice?

What is a writer’s voice? It’s difficult to define, because it’s a combination of language, tone, and self-expression, and really these are all perceived differently by each reader. A writer’s voice is her personality as a writer.

Think of the personalities of your different friends and loved ones: each person has a set of traits that makes him unique, that makes him fun to talk to and that identifies him as a person (not counting physical traits). What makes your best friend different to talk to than your mother?

It’s important to consider that we each have different personalities in different situations. You might be more formal when interviewing for a job, more childlike when talking to your mother, looser when talking to a good friend, commanding when talking to your son. That’s true of all of us … and it’s true of when we write. We have different voices as writers, depending on our audiences.

When you’re considering your voice as a writer, you have to give thought to your audience as well. Who are you talking to? What are they interested in? How do they normally talk? We all keep these things and more in mind when we talk to people in person, and those who don’t have problems communicating with others.

Finding your voice is a matter of finding the right pitch that matches both yourself, and your audience. How do you find that pitch? Think a bit about who you’re talking to, and who you are. Then experiment, until you find the pitch that works for.

### Who are you writing for?

Sometimes, when you’re just starting out as a blogger or writer, you don’t know who your audience is yet. So how can you find the right pitch for that non-existent audience?

Simple: imagine the audience you want to have. Who would you like to talk to? That’s the audience you should write for — not the 10 people who might already be reading, but the 10,000 who might be reading a year from now.

This imaginary audience doesn’t exist, but can be very real in our minds. We can picture them — what they look like, what they read, what their lives are like, what their personalities are like, what pisses them off.

If you already have an audience, even better. Talk to them, and find out more about them. Have conversations in comments and on Twitter and in email, form relationships, read their blogs. Be engaged.

As you talk to them, learn to find the right pitch.

And learn to express yourself in a way that you feel is you.

### Who are you, as a writer?

You don’t know yet who you are, perhaps. Or maybe you do — then you’re one of the lucky ones. If you’re still learning to find your voice, there are some things you can do to explore.

1. Make a list of the things that express who you are, and what you want to communicate.
2. Mimic different writing styles. Read other writers, and mimic their styles — first you mimic, then you find your own style.
3. Write about things you’re passionate about, and let that passion shine through.
4. Add details to posts that make a story come alive — not too many, just the relevant ones, the ones that excite you.
5. Don’t be afraid of feelings, passions, honesty — that’s what makes real communication.
6. Imagine as you write that you’re talking to an old friend.
7. Don’t be afraid of humor either — make little jokes, even if not everyone will get them.
8. Try different writing personas, and write 250 words for each one — be President Obama, Sarah Palin, Kurt Vonnegut, Stephen Colbert, Dave Barry, Seth Godin, Leo Babauta. You’ll throw this away, but it’s not a waste.
9. Read your writing aloud — does it sound like something you might say?
10. Write for 3 minutes — just get going, don’t worry about what you’re writing — it helps loosen you up.
11. Write about things you know well, and explain them to someone who doesn’t know them well.
12. Don’t be afraid to let go of writing conventions to allow your voice to come through — writing “ya know” instead of “do you know what I mean” is an example. Using italics (sparingly) to show inflection is another possible tactic.

# *How to Find Writing Inspiration (Tipsheet)*

**Keep this list as a handy reference.** [Download the tipsheet as a PDF here](http://alistblogging.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/writing-inspirations-tip-sheet.pdf) or read it below.

Or read it below (click to enlarge):

[Open publication](http://issuu.com/MaryJaksch/docs/writing-inspirations-tip-sheet_2_?mode=embed&viewMode=presentation&layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Fsoftlight%2Flayout.xml&showFlipBtn=true) – Free [publishing](http://issuu.com/) – [More creativity](http://issuu.com/search?q=creativity)

### Keep this list as a handy reference.

Always write your ideas down right away.

- Have a tool for capturing ideas: a notebook, a voice recorder, an app on your mobile device, or the Jott note-taking service.
- It’s good to start a new post in your blogging software if you can — write a tentative headline and a few quick ideas to get the post started.
- Collect a list of post ideas, or draft posts, so you always have something to write about.

### Where to find ideas for blog posts: everywhere

1. **Blogs.** There are dozens of great blogs on writing and every topic under the sun. I like to read about what works for others — it inspires me to action!
2. **Books.** I read writers I love and then I steal from them, analyze their writing, get
2. inspired by their greatness.
3. **Overheard dialog.** If you happen to overhear a snippet of interesting dialog,
3. jot it down in your writing journal as soon as possible. It can serve as a model or inspiration for later writing.
4. **Magazines.** Good magazines often have pieces good for their writing style, its voice, its rhythm and ability to pull you along to the end. These pieces can inspire you.
5. **Movies.** Sometimes, while watching a movie, a character will say something so
5. interesting that I’ll say, “That would make a great blog post!”
6. **Forums.** Forumers have ideas that can inspire more ideas in you. Trawling
6. some good forums isn’t a bad idea.
7. **Art.** There is no better inspiration that great art. It doesn’t have to be classical
7. works— there’s inspiration in Japanese anime, on [deviantart.com](http://deviantart.com), in local artists
7. in your area.
8. **Music.** It can be inspiring to download and play great music, from Mozart to
8. Beethoven to the Beatles to Radiohead. Allow it to lift you up and move you.
9. **Friends.** Conversations with friends, in real life, on the phone or via IM, can
9. inspire some of the best posts.
10. **Writing groups.** Whether online or in your community, writing groups are great
10. ways to get energy and motivation for your writing.
11. **The Pocket Muse.** A book full of writing inspirations.
12. **Quotes.** Great quotes help inspire you. Go to various quote sites to find ideas to spark your writing.
13. **Nature.** Stuck for ideas? Go for a walk or a jog. Appreciate the beauty around you, and let the inspiration flow through you.
14. **History.** Great people in history can inspire you to greatness. Benjamin Franklin, Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, Helen Keller, Leonardo da Vinci, and many more.
15. **Travel.** Getting out of your usual area and discovering new places and people can open up new ways of seeing.
16. **Children.** Children, with their fresh outlook on the world, can change theway you view things.
17. **Exercise.** I get my best ideas most often while running. The quietness, the
17. increased flow of blood through your brain, combined with being out in the fresh air with nature, really stimulates the mind.
18. **Religion.** The great religions in the world have ideas in them that are beautiful and inspiring: Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Bahai’i, Buddhism, Taoism, and many cultures with multiple

nature gods.

1. **Newspapers.** Look for human-interest stories that are inspiring. Stories about people who have triumphed over adversity.
2. **Dreams.** Try keeping a dream journal by your bedside and writing down what
2. you can remember when I wake up. Dreams are so interesting in their complete disregard for the rules of reality,
2. for their otherworldness.
3. **Writing journal.** I highly recommend this for any writer. Just a plain notebook will do. Write down thoughts and inspirations and quotes and snippets of good writing you find and pieces of dialog and plot ideas and new characters. Then go back to this journal when you need ideas or inspiration.
4. [*Del.icio.us*](http://Del.icio.us)*.* This popular bookmarking site is a treasure trove of great articles and blog posts and resources.
5. **Poetry.** Its beauty and flow and style and use of rhythm and play on words, through use of language and music.
6. **Shakespeare.** He’s not the only playwright, of course, but he’s undoubtedly the greatest, and the greatest master of the English language as well.
7. **Google.** Stuck for ideas? Search a topic and find tons of great resources.
8. **Freewriting.** One of the best ways to get unstuck if you’re uninspired. Just start writing. Anything. It doesn’t matter. Don’t edit, don’t pause, don’t think. It’ll help you get out of your rut and you might just write some really good stuff among all that garbage.
9. **Brainstorms.** Similar to freewriting, but instead of writing prose you’re writing ideas. Just let them flow. Speed and quantity is more important than quality.
10. **Flickr.** Photography of some of the most talented people in the world can show what everyday humans can do if they try. Just browse through Flickr to find some wonderful inspiration.
11. **Break your routines**. Get out of your rut to see things from a new perspective. Take a new route to work. Change your morning routine. Try reading or writing instead of TV. Shake things up.
12. **Success stories.** The stories of people who have succeeded at what you’re trying to do will inspire you.
13. **People watching.** Go to a busy public place and just sit and watch people. They’ll amuse you, fascinate you. There’s nothing more inspiring than humanity.
14. **Your life.** Every day, you should reflect on what you’ve been doing, not only that day but in your life recently. You might reflect as you’re exercising or meditating or driving or about to go to bed or journaling. What have you been learning? What have you been excited about? What have you failed at? What changes have you successfully made? What have you learned? What can you share with others that will help them do the same? These are all great ideas for blog posts.

# *How to Find Your Unique Style*

How can you stand out from the crowd … and not become just a drop in the immense sea of blogs?

Look at some of the most popular blogs out there today. How are they different? How are they similar?

Although many blogs have a lot of things in common — usually a blog title, headlines, new posts at the top, a sidebar or two — the most successful blogs are the ones that establish a distinct style. Unless it develops a unique “look and feel,” a blog simply becomes one of thousands and thousands of blogs published every day.

Blogs, in this way, are like people — they can blend in with the crowd by choosing to be the same as everyone else, or they can let shine their distinctive personality. The more memorable the better. Blogs like [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.net/), [Goodlife Zen](http://goodlifezen.com/), [The Art of Non-Conformity](http://chrisguillebeau.com/), and [Copyblogger](http://www.copyblogger.com/) all have very unique, recognizable styles.

### What defines the Style of a Blog?

We’ve talked about why it’s important to develop a consistent brand for your blog, to build a message that’s communicated in everything you do. The style and voice of a blog is very much a part of that message.

**Style is the unified impression that your blog gives a visitor.**

Some of the factors that make up the style:

- **Your theme or design**. A theme is the “skin” of your blog, which gives it a particular look and feel. Different themes will have different layouts, navigational systems, and even different functions. They each give the blog a look that communicates something about the blog: profession, calm, loud, minimalist, quirky, feminine, and so on.
- **Your voice**. If your blog looks and reads just like every other blog in your niche, you’ll have a hard time making any sort of impact. Establishing a unique voice is a very important part of defining your blog’s style. Reading bloggers you admire is a good way to learn about the importance of voice – but remember, the most effective voice that you can have on your blog is your own. Your honest, unedited, authentic voice.
- **Your topics and philosophy**. Very similar to voice. The things you choose to write about, and the perspective you bring to those topics, are also a part of the style.
- **Your images**. The types of images you choose for your blog can contribute a great deal to having a distinct style. For example, compare the images on [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.net/) to the images on [The Art of Manliness](http://artofmanliness.com/). Images on Zen Habits tend to be clean, bright, and high-resolution, while images on The Art of Manliness tend to be old-fashioned, sepia-toned, and somewhat rough. Both blogs have managed to convey a distinctive style through their choice of images.
- **Your format**. Are you a videoblogger? A podcaster? A writing blogger? Or perhaps a combination of all three? The format in which you choose to deliver your content makes a big difference. It’s important that you choose a format with which you feel comfortable. Feel free to expand your boundaries, but don’t be afraid to choose one format over another if it allows you to really communicate with your audience.

### Action Steps

- How can you express your core branding message through style? Make short notes on each of the points above to define your style.
- Study these points on other blogs, especially those that convey messages similar to yours. How do they convey this message? Are there elements you can adopt?

# *Bonus Webinar: Mastering Habit Change*

In this bonus webinar on mastering habit change, I give a talk on what it means to master habit change … and what habit change really is.

Here’s a spoiler: it’s about self-learning.

It’s about learning things like:

- How does my mind work?
- How does my environment affect this?
- What motivates me?
- What happens in my mind when I fail?
- What obstacles get in my way?
- What ideals do I have about the habit, and do they match reality?
- Do I trust myself? How do I build that trust?

To succeed at this self-learning process, it helps to:

1. Have the right attitude – of self-learning, not perfection
2. Redefine success – learning and mindfulness, not rigid habits
3. Learn mindfulness, trust, motivation, commitment, watching urges
4. Learn how to adjust your environment to make the habit likely to succeed
5. Build a regular review so you can learn and adjust
