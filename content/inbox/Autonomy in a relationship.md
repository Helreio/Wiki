# Autonomy in a relationship

What makes a relationship tricky is that each has their own inner life and no matter how much we want a full disclosure relationship, that’s just not possible. This autonomy that belongs to each partner is what protects each in case of a fall out in the relationship. And this autonomy to decide what to share or not—this actually is part of what makes a relationship exciting. The growth of the relationship is directly proportional to the openness of each to one another. When I hacked into Lea, I deprived our relationship with this.
