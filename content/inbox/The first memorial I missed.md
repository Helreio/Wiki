# The first memorial I missed

The day I left the church was a full moon. Like most full moons, it came earlier in the sky. 4:30 the white misty figure of the moon has started to reveal itself. I looked at it outside the window in my room as I listened to the scattered footseps of three people going up and down the house. Suddenly, I heard only two sets of footsteps, and I felt like two feet were outside the door of my room.

“Vince, anak, it’s 4:30. We will be leaving by 5:00. You are coming right?” I heard my father’s voice. I hesitated to answer. I thought it would be better to just shut up. But I realized I need to make myself clear. I am moving un uncharted territory.

“Anak, it’s the memorial. You know how importang this is. You’ve missed a coupe of meetings. But this is the memorial.

“I’m not going! I shouted.

I discovered that shouting does the trick. Anger does. When I am able to show to Mama and Papa and my siblings that I am angry, they understand it. Or at least I assure they do: They stop talking, they follow my demands

My father wa as silent after I shouted. But I didn’t hear him move. Perhaps he is waiting for me to change my mind. But it wasn’t. He satarted walking downstared
