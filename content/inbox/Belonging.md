# Belonging

Should you belong?

Or should you be alone?

Is belonging worth it

If your true self is lost along the way?

Is losing yourself worth it

If it's the only way you could belong?

Belonging

A farfetched concept

Churches emptied

Families dismantled

Country towns abandoned

In this lonely world of ours

Where we seek belonging

Through money, and fame, and approval

Only to find ourselves

Farther and farther apart

From each other

Belonging

O that elusive ideal

I seek for it

And yet

I always belonged to you

Always belonged

To myself
