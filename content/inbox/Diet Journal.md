Ate Trio pancit canton for lunch and felt discomfort. I ate yogurt after and the discomfort got really worse. I ate yogurt again in the evening but the discomfort was gone.

I continued eating yogurt after meal. It does have some calming effect. I also started eating atsara and nutritional yeast with my meals. They did not cause any discomfort. I notice an improvement in the feeling of digestion when I wake up.

I continued eating prebiotics and probiotics. I feel less inflamed, especially during days when I ate very little sugar.

I feel like the feeling of indigestion especially when I wake up can still be improved. Since I no longer have to wean off any medications, I decided to try taking the digestive enzyme capsule in the middle of my breakfast. I felt a slight discomfort, but was slowly gone. The capsules I took in the morning and afternoon were weird. I can smell something through my mouth, and I thought I may have done further damage to my throat. Nevertheless, I did feel improvement in terms of digestion. I didn’t burp too much or fart too much today. And the capsule I took in the evening felt better. I do feel a mild discomfort (a pinch) in my right abdomen since taking the capsules.

Woke up feeling better in terms of digestion. Bad breath is improving in the past week. I am slowly tolerating the enzyme capsules. Digestion is getting better. My stool is also getting more solid. I am sleeping better. I am less sleepy in the morning and afternoon. I am sharper. I am a little bit more gloomy particularly when the weather isn’t good, but I am better.
