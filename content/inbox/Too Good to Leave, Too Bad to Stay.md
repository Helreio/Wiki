# Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay

# To My Reader

When you end a relationship that deserves to end, you’re liberating two people to move on to better lives.

Either way, because you’ll see what’s best for you, you’ll be far happier than you’ve been. Everything in your life will be better.

# 1 - Is you is or is you ain't my baby?

Stay

Leave

To stay in your relationship, recommitting to it free of doubt, free of holding back, free at last to pour your love and energy into the relationship and get back everything there is to get from it.

To leave your relationship, finally liberating yourself from it, free of confusion, free of pain, free at last to get on with a new and better life.

Finding clarity depends on whether you actually want to find clarity in the first place.

Your relationship is either too good to leave or too bad to stay in. But it can’t be both. So there are definite answers.

Being stuck like this can end up killing you emotionally if you stay when you should be getting out. And it can end up killing your relationship if you keep thinking about leaving when it could be fixed if you only put energy into it.

Suppose that it would have been best for you to leave. To live with all that negativity and not leave could only destroy your sense of yourself as a valuable, effective person. Or suppose that it would have been best for you to stay. Then living with all that negativity could only pollute and ultimately destroy what would otherwise be a viable marriage.

You can find the clarity you’re looking for if you want to. And I believe you do want to, and that you have everything it takes to see what’s best for you.

2 main questions

1. Which iffy relationships will most likely be okay and which ones are virtually unfixable?
2. What makes people happy they left a relationship? What makes them happy they recommitted to it?

So here’s the deal between you and me. I won’t pull back from making definite recommendations about whether it’s best for you to stay or leave based on your realities and my research and twenty years of clinical experience. In turn, you won’t blindly follow my recommendations for people in a relationship like yours. You’ll certainly want to make sure that you listen to yourself first, to make sure that the reality you’ve uncovered does ring true for you.

Your responsibility is to give them a chance to make sense to you. Don’t act on them before they make sense to you, but don’t fail to act on them afterward. Your life is too important to you to waste any part of it stuck in ambivalence.

# 2 - Dancing in the dark

Relationship ambivalence

- A shift happens where you take the relationship for granted.
- Then, bad qualities in the other person or in the relationship get worse while good qualities dwindle.
- Eventually, the bulk of your attention shifts from being in your relationship to trying to figure out whether to stay in it or leave.

After working on the front lines as a therapist for more than twenty years, I’ve learned that almost no one gets to this point without having worked hard to make the relationship better. We take love too seriously to give up on it without a fight. At the same time, on almost the very first day that love isn’t enough, we also feel hurt, and we withdraw and stand back, waiting and hoping for the other person to make things better.

But thinking about leaving hasn’t helped either. It’s not that you don’t know how to go about it, at least in general. It’s just that you aren’t sure you’ll be better off leaving. Even when you’re fed up with the person you’re with, it’s still not clear that leaving will be better than your entire current life with that person.

Imagining what your life will be like if you leave hasn’t helped.

**What is common in all ambivalent relationships**

While everyone expresses ambivalence a little differently, there’s one thing people have in common: ambivalence in your heart goes hand in hand with distance in your relationship. When you feel ambivalent about your partner you make distance from your partner. You spend less time together. You talk less, and about less important things. You stop doing things together. There’s a cool, formal, ritualistic quality to the relationship. You make distance from your partner because you’re having an emotionally intense affair with your own ambivalence.

And like all the other things you do in your ambivalence, distance only serves to make it worse. Now your ambivalence has taken on a life of its own.

**The balance-scale approach**

When it comes to relationships, the balance-scale approach is the problem, not the solution. It gets us into trouble, not out of it. How can you weigh the things you know about your relationship in the present against a huge uncertain future? How can you weigh a problem that’s bad for you against the knowledge that a lot of people have this problem but don’t seem to be breaking up their relationships over it? How can you weigh a problem that makes you want to scream today against the possibility that it won’t bother you so much tomorrow?

With the balance-scale approach pieces of evidence keep sliding in and out of the picture. You try to add things up that don’t add up, to compare things that can’t be compared.

So no more relationship ambivalence, starting right now. No more putting your relationship on trial. No more weighing huge, unwieldy piles of evidence pro and con. No more listening to the voices on both sides producing endless arguments and very little clarity. Fortunately, there’s a much better alternative, one that will help you see straight through to the truth about your relationship.

# 3 - Enough is enough (Issue: Danger signs)

**Diagnosis not trial**

Here’s how to find your way out of relationship ambivalence. Don’t put your relationship on trial the way lawyers do. Make a diagnosis the way doctors do.

Instead of balancing pros and cons, we’ll try to arrive at a diagnosis of your relationship. At each step you’ll answer a question about an issue between you and your partner. In most cases it’ll be a straightforward, easy-to-answer, yes-or-no question. Depending on your answer, you may be able to get a clear indication right then and there of whether it’s best for you to stay or leave. You’ll have found out what’s real about your relationship without needing to go further.

**One step at a time**

The order of the questions is carefully arranged. The main principle, as with any diagnostic procedure, is to deal with the clearest, most obvious issues first.

Earlier diagnostic questions here deal with clearer, more obvious issues, and later questions deal with more nuanced issues. By the end we’ll have dealt with all the major issues that might bother you.

Trust yourself, take things a step at a time, and think of each question as an opportunity to find out what’s real for you. Often you’ll know the answer right away, but sometimes you may have to sift through your thoughts and feelings and memories.

The point is that with the step-by-step approach all you have to do is come up with one answer to one question about one issue at a time.

The diagnostic questions here include everything that’s important to pay attention to in deciding whether to stay or leave. If it’s not in the questions, it’s not so important in deciding what’s best for you, and you can let go of worrying about it.

**Step #1: They were the best of times**

Think about the good times for a moment. The best time, in fact. Try to remember when you felt most comfortable, most satisfied, most optimistic about the relationship you’re in.

If you’ve been together a long time, don’t worry about being too thorough. Trust your unconscious to throw a searchlight on a “best” time even if it’s not the absolute best.

Diagnostic question #1. Think about that time when things between you and your partner were at their best. Looking back, would you now say that things were really very good between you then?

Good

Bad

In love

Genuinely happy

Felt good about yourself when you are with her.

An empty, distant, tainted, painful quality at the core of the relationship.

For most people whose relationships are iffy now, they were pretty good at one point. But for about ten percent of you, they were actually never very good.

*Guideline #1*

If, when your relationship was at its “best,” things between you didn’t feel right or work well, the prognosis is poor. I feel comfortable saying that you’ll feel you’ve discovered what’s right for you if you choose to leave.

Quick take: If it never was very good, it’ll never be very good.

Why leave

- Most people in your situation who leave are happy they did so.
- If it was never very good at its best, then where are the good things going to come from that you have a right to look forward to in any relationship? You can wait, but it’s unlikely you’ll find them.
- Clinical practice + research prove: You can often fix what was broken, but you can rarely fix what never worked in the first place.
- A basic difficulty was present from the beginning, which prevented things from being good or prevented you from seeing that they weren’t good.
- The satisfaction-producing core that’s necessary for a relationship to take root was never there.
- A relationship that was never very good is unlikely to become good in the future.

Satisfaction-producing core

- Even if there’s a pile of awful things over it, below the surface is a solid source of satisfaction.
- If this is lacking, there is a basic discord: an emotional, psychological fracture or dislocation or disconnection.
- This rotten foundation produces distance and hostility.
- A relationship is too bad to stay in if it has this basic discord.

Love

- It has to function as our servant, not our master.
- Love isn’t blind and it isn’t stupid. It can see and it can learn. If you allow your love to see the truth of your relationship, if you allow your love to take care of you, it’ll respond appropriately.
- Do you really want to open your heart to a love that will not let you show it the truth of your life? If the truth is that there’s a basic discord in your relationship, that it’s dead and will never work, what good is a love that refuses to see this?
