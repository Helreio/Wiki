# it is okay to always be in touch with what really matters

There are people like me who are so transcendental that almost every day, we think about the large picture, the purpose. It keeps us grounded. Obviously, we don't want to always be looking at our plan and changing it, it's not practical and even possible to uphold. But I think, it is okay to always be in touch with what really matters: the core desires behind each action and each goal and each long-term plan.
