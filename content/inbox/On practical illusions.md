# On practical illusions

Many of our illusions are practical.

We need them to communicate.

And communication is vital if we want to take care of the planet.

What is clear and this is not just an “Eastern” philosophic stance is that reality is layered.

This means there is a metaphysical nature which is TRUE. But it is concealed because of barriers in sensual and conceptual tools.

The TRUTH is there, deep, and uncovering it is a worthwhile endeavor. Building a worldview out of them is of course desirable.

But it doesn’t mean that we have to discard the REALITY that is at the top of the TRUTH. These illusions are “necessary”. And entire worldviews were built out of them and many of these worldviews have been beneficial. To discard them is not just dangerous but practically impossible.

For practical means, working together in unison is the most we can do now.
