# Communication is a perfect example of mind matter abstract process

Creator, mind

- A creator generates a thought
   - The though gets translated to "text" (physical material)
   - Spoken words (sound - matter)
   - Written words or symbols (solid - matter)
   - Text is a physical representation of a mental thought

Receiver's mind

- Receiver receives text but will never get the original mental thought because that original thought is owned primarily by the thinker.
- What happens is that the receiver creates his own mental thought

All reading is distortion of the original.

I will never get the exact mental state.

I create my own that is "hopefully" approximately similar.

Yes may daloy pero more on daloy na may mga sala

Because consuming text stimuli and creating information out of it requires energy, energy which is scarce, we need to find an efficient way to manage this process.
