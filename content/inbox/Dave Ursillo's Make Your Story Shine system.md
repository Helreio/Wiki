# Dave Ursillo's Make Your Story Shine system

**Step 1. First considerations**

**What are you starting with?**

Start fresh especially when it has been a while since you last wrote your story. Or you could work with a more recent draft.

**Where will this story be shared?**

About page

Home page

Social media bio

**What are your goals with this story?**

1. I want to articulate the story for myself so I can get clear about what I really want to do and achieve in my life work.
2. I want to be able to communicate what I do and what I want to do to my tribe, so that I could build connections with them. I want them to contact me via email or sign up to my email list.

**Step 2. Reminders**

Frame who you are today (and what you’re doing in your life, work, etc.) through details and examples of where you’ve been and what you’ve done in the past.

The person who’s experiencing your story should be able to see or feel themselves *through* you.

communicate a deep understanding of the reader, as if you know him or her very, very well

get raw, real and deeply personal. Share your beliefs and harships.

convince someone who doesn’t know you of what you want, what you believe and what you’re doing to make it happen.

**Step 3. Write it**

- **Present** who you are (answering the ever-important facts, up front),
- **Show** where you’ve been (including your credentials, background, context, etc.)
- **Explain** where you intend to go in your work/in your life (ie, this is what you’re driving at, and why you’re doing anything at all)
- **Invite** the reader to join you, get on board, work with you, etc. (in other words, how to continue the relationship you’ve sparked)

Part 1: Who are you?

￼￼*State who you are and what you do, in the simplest and most direct of terms. What’s your name? Where are you from? What do you do?*

Part 2: Where have you been?

*What’s your story? What brought you here? Get personal. Is there a challenge, hardship or struggle that you’ve overcome? Tell me how it (directly or indirectly) guided you more towards getting here, today.*

*Don’t be afraid to tell your story. Reveal 2-3 key pieces of your personal/professional background that have led you here today. Your story provides context, understanding and relevance. Make them feel themselves through you.*

Part 3: Where are you going?

*Future tense. What do you believe in? Why are you doing all of this? This is where you really blow the doors off “the why” that motivates and drives you. Why do you do what you do? You’re starting to tie your story together.*

Share what you offer, and why you offer it.

*How have your experiences and your background led you to what you’re doing today? Why do you believe what you believe, and how does that shape what you do?*

Part 4: Call to action

*Present tense. Melt your “why” into restating what you’re doing today. Do so in a way that invokes a strong response or “want” for your reader to further engage you, your story or what you’re offering them.*

Invite your visitors to become a part of your mission. Entice them. Place the opportunity, invitation or call-to-action on display. Don’t hide it! Tell them you want them to join you, work with you, keep connected to you.

In an About Page format, each of these four points would embody between one to three paragraphs.

- **Part One: 1-2 Paragraphs.** Edge on the side of 1. You should be able to say who you are in four sentences or less. State it up front, in earnest, and directly. Don’t dance around the facts.
- **Part Two: 2-4 Paragraphs.** Don’t be overly long-winded, but your personal and professional history will take more time to explain–and, after all, this is the very context of *why* you’re here and *why* you’re doing what you’re doing, and thus, *why* I’m reading, and *why* I should care at all.
- **Part Three: 2-3 Paragraphs.** Don’t short yourself now. It’s time to explain where you’re going and how you’re getting there (through the work that you do, what you offer and how you offer it, etc.). Bring home the context of your background by showing how it relates to what you’re doing now.
- **Part Four: 1-2 Paragraphs.** Clearly distinguish how I can get on board. What is the one manner in which you want this reader to “join you”? Don’t present 15 options, keep it simple, streamlined and effective. Less is more.

Step 4. Leave out these disclaimers

Don’t reek of shame, guilt, fear, and uncertainty.

Leave out the following:

- "I'm a work in progress."
- Admitting unknowns.
- Offering bewilderment.

Step 5. Edit and revise.

1. Remove unknowns, unsureness, and admissions about your story, path, direction, and purpose.
2. If it can be left unsaid, don’t say it.
3. Don’t waste words on who you’re not.

Step 6. Ask for feedback

- Don’t invite family for feedback.
- Look toward peers who share a *similar* line of work.
- Tap peers who you’re friends with, but who each know you in their own way.
- Don’t ask for a certain *number* of feedback points.
- Ask a few literal questions for him/her to answer, in addition to their own ideas.

Step 7. Integrate and discard feedback

- When reading feedback, remember that it is the story, and not you being judged.
- Identify glaring omissions, errors, points of confusion–and remedy them immediately.
- Discard most of the feedback you’ve been given.
- Consider and integrate a few key gems.
   - *The big changes to make are usually getting more concrete and specific about your past/background, how someone can get involved with you (really simply and specifically), and your working methods.*

Step 8. Publish.

I'm Vince Imbat. I'm a writer who explores what it means to live a life of independent philosophical contemplation in the 21st century.

A life-changing but difficult depressive episode in 2011 led me to question my identity, worldview, and life purpose. A year after my episode, I left my calling as a young evangelical pastor to seek for a new way of life - one that was more authentic to who I really am. Little did I knew that the years of programming within the confines of my childhood religion was designed to crush this very desire to search for truth independently. With no knowledge or training to do a proper search, I jumped from one political, philosophical, or spiritual tradition to the next, only to find myself with the same existential void I had when I started. No matter how enticing the existing traditions were, they always left out or even went against an important aspect of my personhood. Political and philosophical traditions did not accomodate my spiritual side enough. On the other hand, spiritual groups neglected and even discouraged my intellectual side.

Years of trial-and-error have convinced me that my worldview and purpose will never be found in established traditions but will have to be built from the ground up through an independent philosophical contemplative practice.

I am always looking for companions in this journey. If you are interested in learning more about what it means to live a life of independent philosophical contemplation, follow my work. I write about my journey and document projects related to this way of life in my monthly email newsletter Uman. You can learn more about the newsletter and subscribe here.

Alternatively, you can direcltly send me an email at vince@vinceimbat.com. Tell me about your own independent philosophical contemplative practice or your desire to embrace a life along that line.
