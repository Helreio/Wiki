# Statement

Sa angking husay ko sa **pananaliksik, pagsusulat, at paglikha ng mga teorya, methods, at systems** magkakaroon ako ng business na **self-directed learning resource center** na magbibigay sakin ng halagang **P100,000** kada buwan na (kulang/sapat/**labis**) sa aking pangangailangan. Ngunit sa totoo lang, kahit walang bayad gagawin ko parin ito dahil mahal ko ang **pananaliksik, pagsusulat, at paglikha ng mga teorya, methods, at systems** dahil **tumitigil ang oras kapag ginagawa ko ito**, **maginhawa ako**, at **pakiramdam ko at home ako**, at dahil nakakatulong itong solusyunan ang problema ng mundo na **kawalan ng mga facilitative at non-sectarian na mga espasyo para sa self-discovery at self-actualization** dahil ang **self-directed learning resource center** ay **makapagbibigay espasyo para sa mga honest, cautious, self-educated learners na makatanggap ng guidance, safe community, at training para sa mas malalim na introspection**, **intellectual growt**, at **reative nurturing.**

To do
