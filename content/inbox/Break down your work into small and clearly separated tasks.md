# Break down your work into small and clearly separated tasks

Breaking down your work into small tasks allows you to focus on one thing at a time, finish fast, and finish many.

In writing, the small nature of tasks in note-writing systems like [[Zettelkasten]] and [[Talahardin]] allows you to consciously shift attention as you finish each task in a reasonable amount of time.

Breaking down writing into small tasks allows you to manage and review realistic goals on a regular basis. It is also one way that [[Writing can be easy]].

Other benefits of breaking down writing into small tasks include:

- Working on smaller tasks makes it much easier to get started
- Working on smaller tasks makes receiving feedback easier
- Working on smaller tasks allows breaks without losing the thread
- [[Working on smaller tasks creates a sense of control]]
- [[Working on smaller tasks develops intuition]]

To do

- Literature note. Cultivate it to become a permanent note by internalizing it into your Talahardin system.
