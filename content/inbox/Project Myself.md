# Project Myself

1. To understand truth and make it intelligible for myself.
2. To live a fulfilled life and a happy life.

The goal is not to be famous. The goal is to grow wiser and more compassionate towards myself and others. This is the calling—the Project Myself—a daily practice of listening to the self to understand itself and the world around it.

My turf: asking the deepest questions about the universe.

Reexplore amoralism and the possibility to create a practice around it.
