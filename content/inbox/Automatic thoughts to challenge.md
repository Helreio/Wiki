# Automatic thoughts to challenge

After what happened, she's no longer the same.

I can't fully commit to her with this in our history.

I can't get over this.

She was defiled.

Rebuttals

It is unfair that you take pleasure from what she did and yet you feel bad that she enjoyed and took pleasure from it. You should be happy that she enjoyed it as much or perhaps more than you did. You are going thru confusing shit in your mind but also with her. This shouldnt break you. It should make your partnership stronger. It did make it stronger! Thats undeniable. Theres no knowing when you will make up your mind and commit if this didnt happen.

If you can continue to love her (despite or because of what she agreed to do), then trust that she will also continue to love you.

This thing that feels bad about it and who has no self confidence. This is not me. This is my upbringing and background religion etc.
