# Gian's three-pronged model of an ultimate creative entrepreneur

According to [[Gian de Jesus]], an ultimate creative entrepreneur is someone who is:

1. An academic
2. A consultant
3. An entrepreneur

Since [[All advice is biographical]], it is important to know where Gian came from. Gian started his work as a struggling entrepreneur. He studied abroad and is about to pursue a PhD. He believes that degrees are *chapas* (badges) or signals of credibility in the industry and in society at large. They elevate the entrepreneur's reputation. Plus, they give social status to someone whose success isn't always sure. Academics can be consultants too. Entrepreneurs, even when not yet making a lot of money, could be consultants because of their rich experience. Doing all three makes the creative journey more resilient from emotional and financial burnout. Failure in one (especially in entrepreneurship) itself is not as painful because one has other identities and sources of income.

While not directly similar, the purpose of *chapas* seem to be fulfilled by a [[thoughts/day job model]] where the day job also provides a front identity for a creative, who is on his way to making his work known or an entrepreneur who hasn’t gain traction yet. This is what [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]]’s work as a surveyor did when he was struggling as a writer. I used to be hesitant to use my current day job as an editor as a front identity, but I am seeing the wisdom behind it now. Providing this signal helps me build confidence when talking to people who are outside my current sphere of influence.

My only fear with Gian’s proposal is that academic work could interfere with entrepreneurship once all gain traction, and the creative or entrepreneur will have to make the painful decision of letting go of one if their conflict becomes unbearable.

To do

- While the discussion above seems all necessary, you might still be able to flesh this note out into shorter notes. It's too long.
