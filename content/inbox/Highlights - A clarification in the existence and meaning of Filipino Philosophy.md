# Highlights - A clarification in the existence and meaning of Filipino Philosophy

To have a clear understanding of the meaning of Filipino Philosophy, we need to have a clear understanding of the meaning of both “Filipino” and “Philosophy” in the context of the structure of their combination in the phrase “Filipino Philosophy”.

Filipino Philosophy refers to works (or ideas within works) that both contain characteristics of being Philosophical and Filipino.

We cannot use the word Philosophy to refer to words like idea or perspective *all the time*. Because Philosophy can also be used as an adjective rather than a noun, that is, it can be used to refer to the characteristics of ideas and perspectives, that is philosophical.

The word philosophy can be used in two ways:

1. Lenient: As a synonym for words like idea, belief, opinion, tip, reason, principle, etc. Here the word philosophy refers to something that may not be philosophical.
2. Strict: As a word used in the discipline of philosophy, which refers to ideas that are philosophical.

In the strict use of the word philosophy in the academe, there are three fundamental hallmarks of philosophical works:

1. Topic: A work is philosiphical if it delves on the topics and problems existing in the branches of philosophy: logic, ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics
2. Methodology
3. Ways of advancing ideas in a work

An important characteristic of philosophy is that it delves on foundational questions that aim to inquire about the basis of beliefs and frameworks in almost all aspects of life. This is the reason why we have philosophy of religion, ethics, science, education, culture, and society.

So the discipline of philosophy is the study and analysis done on the foundations of beliefs and not the beliefs themselves. To refer to a belief as a philosophy is to use the word philosphy in the lenient sense.

Foundational questions are universal in nature. Philosophical questions are asked by an individual in the level of being a human and not being a Filipino.

Concrete or pesonal problems could cause a person to ask philosophical questions. But once asked, philosophical questions no longer just delve into the problem of a specific person but of humanity as a whole.

It is the philosopher who has a nationality, not the philosophy.

The ideas of philosophy, much like the ideas of mathematics and science, are universal. Therefore, their conclusions and applications applies to everyone whatever their nationality.

A work is philosophical if it uses methods of philosophy in philosophical traditions like:

- phenomenology
- analytical philosophy
- existentialism
- Marxism
- feminism
- postmodernism
- hermenuitics

A work is philosophical if its ideas are supported by arguments. Arguments refer to reasonings that show how we arrived in certain conclusions that answer philosophical questions. Arguments are used to judge which among differing opinions have a better probability of being true.

A philosophical writing in the strict sense delves in a foundational problem, uses philosophical methods, and uses arguments to advance ideas.

How we interpret the term “Filipino Philosophy” should follow how similar terms are used in existing contexts like “Greek philosophy”, “Chinese philosophy”, etc. These contexts use the strict sense of the word philosophy.

To ask if there is a Filipino philosophy, while using the lenient interpretation of the word philosophy, is to insult Filipinos. Filipinos are people and it is natural for them to have thoughts. This is a question that shouldn’t be asked. The right question to ask is to ask whether there is a Filipino philosophy, using the strict definition of the word, because even if Filipinos have thoughts and opinions, not everyone engages in the three hallmarks of philosophy and writes about them.
