# Design ideas

I am primarily a writer and thinker.

I am currently exploring photography, videography, and other media, but Iâ€™m not that good yet.

I want to focus on my ideas, my content, my story, my message.

# Images

I will seldom use visuals, but when I do, I will mostly use my own photographs.

Eventually, I would consider using illustrations (when necessary).
