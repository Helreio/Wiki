# Writing for myself vs. writing for others

I want to use writing primarily to be wiser—that is, to understand myself, the world, other people, and act accordingly. The writing that helps me do this is journaling and writing in my talahardin.

I think, where I really need to do more introspection is determining the kind of writing I want to share to the world. I want to share the things I am learning from my personal study—the big questions. I want to help people feel awe and appreciate the complexity and the beauty of the physical world, life itself, and ideas on how to live. But I also want to write using my lens—the “I”, my story.

I want to write essays that people go back to and refer when they think about the topic I am writing about.

I want to publish one or two essays per month. But these essays should have went through revisions and more careful work—essays that represent me more, that tells my story better, that explains and expresses my worldview better.
