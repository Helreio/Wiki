# I am not myself alone

I am the entire universe

To heal the self means to heal the entire universe

That means to heal the outside and the inside at the same time

Not just the inside

Not just the outside

Lifestyle is key

My lifestyle should be designed to take care of everyone - my self, other people, animals, plants, the entire world
