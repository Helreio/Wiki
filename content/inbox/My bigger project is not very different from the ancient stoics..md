# My bigger project is not very different from the ancient stoics.

We are both concerned about maintaining a certain state of mind. For stoics it is tranquility. Mine is ginhawa. Although it is very indigenous, it is somehow similar to tranquility.

Whatever the emotion is, the stoics (and I do) believe that we can build or design our environments to help us develop certain states of mind.
