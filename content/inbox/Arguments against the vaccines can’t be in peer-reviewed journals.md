# Arguments against the vaccines can’t be in peer-reviewed journals

I assume I will find overwhelming support on the vaccines in peer-reviewed scientific journals. It will be difficult to find contrarian ideas there. To find contrarian ideas, look elsewhere—among doctors who have different experiences, for example.

The success of the anti-vaccine argument rests on the following:

- Proof that peer-reviewed journals cannot be trusted.
- Evidence against the vaccine exists elsewhere in more trustworthy places.
