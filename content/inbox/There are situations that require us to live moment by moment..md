# There are situations that require us to live moment by moment.

These are situations that force us to live that way. Because to not live that way causes suffering - specifically mentally. But mental suffering causes physical suffering as well.

These situations are situations of difficulty, when suicide creeps in as a viable option.

Depression.

Chronic illness.

Grief.

Tinnitus.

These are situations that force us to accept the arrival of what wasn't there a while ago and the loss of something that was there before.

Vibrance.

Health.

A loved one.

Perfect hearing.
