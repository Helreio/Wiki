# I am at my best when I am

- playing games
- engaged with language
- have something I believe in; investing myself into that belief
- engaged with creativity
- nurtures the child in me that never grew up
- I lead
- sleeping well, physically active, eating well, healthy
- not in a state of scarcity, enough, sufficient, with some extra (I’ve been in this state ever since I learned editing at Bookbright in 2015-2016 and especially with Scribendi)
- has control over my learning
- has creative freedom
- being surrounded by inspiring people who are into personal development
- being part of a vigorous community
- in nature, regular communion with beauty
- exposed to excellence
- mindful, kind, and sincerely caring for the other
- I don’t have quarrels with people - calm social life
