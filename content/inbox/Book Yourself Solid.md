# 2.6 - The Sales Cycle Process

All sales start with a simple conversation.

An effective sales cycle is based on turning these simple conversations into relationships of trust with your potential clients over time.

People buy from those they like and trust.

All sales start with a simple conversation and are executed when a need is met and the appropriate amount of trust is assured.

Permission Marketing

- Stop interrupting people with your marketing messages.
- Turn strangers into friends by adding value.
- Turn friends into customers by getting permission from them to offer your products and services.

What to do?

1. First understand how you’re going to lead people into your sales cycle through building trust.
2. Create a sales cycle process that will attract more clients than you can handle and do so with the utmost integrity.

**The 6 Keys to Creating Connection**

1. Choose one person within your target market to focus on and describe him/her in specific terms.
2. Understand the kinds of products and services your target audience is looking for.
3. Understand where and how your target market look for you.
4. Describe the situations that are likely to drive potential clients to seek your services, products, and programs.
5. Hone in to the reasons why your potential clients should choose you (expertise, training, and strengths).
6. Establish a line of communication where you can develop a relationship of trust with your target market.

Why you need to get the conversation going by continuing to connect with your target market?

- Because they may not need your products or services now but when they need it will be easier for them to reach out.

**The 6 Core Self-Promotion Strategies**

Your goal is not to sell but to offer an invitation that has no barrier to entry. Create awareness for the services, products, and programs you offer through one or all of the following:

1. Networking Strategy
2. Direct Outreach Strategy
3. Referral Strategy
4. Speaking Strategy
5. Writing Strategy
6. Web Strategy

**The Book Yourself Solid Sales Cycle Process**

Your services have a high barrier to entry. To potential new clients, your services are intangible and expensive—whether you think they are or not—especially to those who have not used the kind of services that you offer or who have not had good results with their previous service providers.

As opposed to the typical sales cycle, which has the same start and end points for all prospective clients, the Book Yourself Solid Sales Cycle works in a way that allows buyers to enter at any point in the process, depending on their situation. A client hires you when the circumstances in his life or work match the offers that you make.

As you work through this process, remember all that you are doing is having a simple conversation with someone. You are making a connection that will build trust so that you will then be able to share your services with another person.

**Stage 1: No-barrier-to-entry Offer**

- Create a no-barrier-to-entry offer to potential clients (no risks ample).
- Objective: Get a potential client to do something that begins to affiliate them to you.
- Goal must be simple and measurable (driving prospective clients to your web site).
- Choose strategies you would like to use to achieve it.

**Stage 2: Demonstrate Sincerity**

- Demonstrate your knowledge, solutions, and sincere desire to provide value to your target market free of charge, with no barrier to entry and at no risk to them.
- Results: Increased trust
- Offer solutions, opportunities, and relevant information in exchange for contact information and permission to continue communicating over time.
- Communication: tip sheet, special report, or white paper that addresses their urgent needs and compelling desires. Also demonstrates what you want them to know about how you can serve them.

**Stage 3: Develop and Enhance Trust**

- Objective 1: To continue to add value by helping your potential clients incorporate the information that you gave them.
- Objective 2: Make a sale.
- Free report -> automated emails that help them use the content in the report to create value.
- Offer them something that will surprise them (example: complimentary pass to a workshop or recommended resources on your area of expertise)
- Offer something that may cost them money but has very little cost.

# 1.3 - Develop a Personal Brand

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056879,120.453705)

A personal brand should help clearly and consistently define, express, and communicate who you are, who you serve, and why you have chosen to dedicate your life and work to serving your target market.

The more bold, authentic, and concise your personal brand is, the more easily you'll attract those you're meant to work with.

Develop a personal brand that looks like you, thinks like you, sounds and feels like you—one that is instantly recognizable as your essence.

A personal brand should be:

- Clear
- Consistent
- Authentic
- Memorable
- Meaningful
- Soulful
- Personal

The greatest strategy for personal and business development on the planet is bold self-expression.

Help clients understand how you can help them.

Make sure that your personal and professional intentions are clear.

Many business problems are simply personal problems in disguise.

In order to set clear intentions for yourself, you must remove the conflicting intentions that you currently have. Your reality is created by your present intentions and action on them. If you want to change your reality, you must change your intentions.

3 components to your personal brand

1. Your who and do what statement.
2. Your why you do it statement.
3. Your tagline.

Laser-beam your focus on these three aspects of your personal brand until you feel totally and utterly fully expressed when you put words to your who and do what statement, your why you do it statement, and your tagline.

# 1.2 - Why People Buy What You’re Selling

**Steps**

1. Identify your target market.
2. Understand the urgent needs and compelling desires of your target market.
3. Determine the number one biggest result your clients get.
4. Uncover and demonstrate the benefits of your investable opportunities.

**Target Market**

- The demographics of the group you’re most passionate about serving.

**Ideal Clients**

- Small subset of your target market.
- Individuals who energize and inspire you.

**Niche**

- The service you specialize in offering to your target market.

**What is wrong about choosing a Target Market?**

- Choosing a target market that isn’t as specific as it needs to be.
- Choosing a target market based on what you think is the most logical and most lucrative choice.

**How to choose a Target Market?**

- Choose a market that you feel passionate about serving.

**What to do after choosing a Target Market?**

- Look where to focus your marketing efforts (associations, magazines, and journals).
- Look for influential people with whom to network.
- Research what to offer that will be compelling.

Marketing and sales is about putting yourself out in front of, and offering your services to people who already need and are looking for your services.

**2 Primary Ways to Grow Your Business**

1. Horizontal Expansion - Sell more service or products to one market.
2. Vertical Expansion - Sell your services to more markets.

Horizontally expand your services and products to one target market. Then vertically expand to other target markets.

As you establish your expertise and reputation, if you choose, you can broaden your target market.

If you want to increase your speed to getting booked solid, choose a very specific target market and stay with that target market until you are booked solid. Then you can move into other markets if you like or stay with your original focus and grow your product and service line.

**Identifying Your Target Market**

To identify your target market, start with your own needs, desires, and passions rather than those of your clients. When you choose a target market you’re passionate about, growing your business will feel like play and will bring you joy.

Tune into your intuition.

**How to identify the needs and desires of your target market?**

Offer what your potential clients want to buy, not what you want to sell or think they should want to buy.

Look at your services from your client’s perspective: their urgent needs and compelling desires.

**Urgent needs and compelling desires**

- Things that they must have right away
- Pressing problems
- Things they would like to move away from
- Things they want in the future

**Determine the biggest result your clients get**

- What is the number one result you help your clients achieve or get?
- Every product or service you offer must have one big promise. Your job is to fulfill that promise.

**Demonstrate the benefits of your investable opportunities**

- Customers must feel that the return they receive will be greater than the investment they made.
- Clients should receive at least 20 times their investment.
- Returns in financial, emotional, physical, and spiritual (FEPS).
- These potential rewards must be evident before your clients purchase services from you.
- Know what your clients want and deliver it.
- Focus on clear, specific, and detailed solutions that solve your clients’ problems.
- To make it obvious that your solutions are investable opportunities for your potential clients, you need to uncover and demonstrate their benefits.
- Benefits are tangible but more often they're intangible.
- People buy results and the benefits of those results.
- Think about the solutions you offer and the subsequent results and benefits they provide.

View yourself as a highly important and trusted advisor and leader in your audience’s life.

Build connection with your audience over time by giving benefit after benefit and show them how they can fulfill the promise of your offerings.

ABC: Always Be Communicating. Let everybody and anybody know how you help people.
