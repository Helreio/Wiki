# Environment and Ethics

The problem of environmentalism is ultimately a problem of ethics.

Of what is right and wrong.

Is it right to adopt an anthropocentric view of the world - where man's interests is treated more important than the interests of other species?

Should we adopt a biocentric view instead where we include the interests of other species in our ideas of what is right or wrong to do?

If we take the biocentric route, then we accept that an species other than man has private property and rights, which guarantees its protection.

Should we give an species other than man equal rights as humans?

Should we regard some species more deserving of rights than others?

The moment we become humans, having greater abilities to philosoohize, we have a duty to protect the lesser complex species
