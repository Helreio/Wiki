# Module 3: The Principles of Great Photography

# Mindset of a Great Photographer

## See the world around you.

- No matter where you are.

Photography helps you become more observant and appreciative.

## Become an observer.

- Don't look at the world through the lens of the camera.
- Use your naked eyes.
- Learn how to predict how scenes could unfold.

## Think of failure as a learning experience.

- Don't get too attached to the outcome of what you are doing.
- Get attached to the process.

## Keep experimenting.

- Subjects, genres, angles, composition techniques, apps, etc.

## Only the best photos count.

- Be a curator of your own work. Publish only the best. Improve the quality of your portfolio.

# 3 Secrets for Choosing the Perfect Photography Angle

1. ## Shoot from a lower angle.

Never settle for the most obvious angle. Use an angle that we don’t usually see.

When the horizon is not in your photo, you have more freedom to rotate the angle of the shot. A horizon can be a restriction to photo composition.

2. ## Get down to the level of your subject.
3. ## Get closer to your subject to show small details.
- If there are too many subjects, get closer to one and make the other as a background.
- Find a pattern in the many objects and highlight that.

# How to Find Subjects for Stunning iPhone Photos

When taking a photo, ask: What is the subject of this image?

Challenge yourself. Go beyond the most obvious subjects.

A photo with no subject could work if there is a strong pattern that works on its own.

# How to Compose Photos Using the Rule of Thirds

The rule of thirds is more of a tool not a rule.

Learn a lot of composition guidelines to have a lot of tools.

In portrait photography, the eyes of the subject is the most important thing that viewers will look at. Put them in one of the intersections of the grid.

Leave more space on where a subject is looking at or on the direction of movement. But you can break this for a creative purpose.

# Using Creative Composition Techniques

## Symmetry

Reflection photos

Architecture

Staircase

## Leading Lines

Lines that direct the eyes of the viewer towards a subject

Roads

Railroad tracks

Power lines

## Patterns

Strong patterns that fills an entire frame

## Diagonal Principle

You need at least two subjects for it to work.

Balances a composition both vertically and horizontally.

# How Light Affects Your iPhone Photos

Always observe light and be a student of it and how it affects your photography.

Sometimes, if the light isn’t right, it’s not even worth taking a photo.

## The Intensity of Light

Because the iPhone has a smaller sensor than a DSLR, it needs more light for better results.

You’ll get better results from natural light outdoors than studio light indoors.

Two kinds of light

1. Soft light - cloudy day
2. Hard light - direct sunlight, deep shadows, bright highlights

Generally speaking, a sunny day is bad for photography. You might get better results in a cloudy day. You get soft light. Very little shadows.

Hard light can be good for street photography or othe creative genres.

If it’s a sunny day, wait for the Goldren Hour (morning and evening).

The Golden Hour has directional light.

The Blue Hour - the first hour after sunset or first our before sunrise. The best place to take photos during this hour is large bodies of water or open field or open space.

Because there is very little light during this hour, make use of a tripod or keep your hands steady to avoid movement.
