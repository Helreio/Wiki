# Natural planning model

According to David Allen, we naturally follow the following steps when planning:

1. **Define our** [[thoughts/purpose]]**.** We define the impetus and boundaries of our plan (*why*).
2. **Define our principles.** We define the boundaries of our plan.
2. **Outcome vision.** We picture the *what:* what it looks, sounds, and feels like when our purpose is best fulfilled.
3. **Brainstorm.** Our brain follows this natural process to fill in the gaps of our plan (*how*).
4. **Organize.** After ideas (components, subproject, priorities, sequence) are produced, our brain automatically sorts these out.
5. **Define the next action.** Identify the next action that will make the first component actually happen.
