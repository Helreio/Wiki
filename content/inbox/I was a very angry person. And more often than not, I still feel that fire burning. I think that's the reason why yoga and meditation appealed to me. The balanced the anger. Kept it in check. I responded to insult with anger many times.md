I was a very angry person. And more often than I wish, I still feel that fire in me burning. I think that's the reason why yoga and meditation appealed to me. They balanced the anger. Kept it in check. I responded to insult with anger many times and I ask myself the same question all the time. Will I really be able to act nonviolently in the face of violence? Will I really be able to love the enemy? Because I'm a pacifist, a principled answer from me will say "yes." But I know I am also inclined to act otherwise. So, I agree, there is a large, large difficulty here. I think how one approaches personal attacks and malicious intentions will largely depend on a tug-of-war between one's personality and one's principles. Some will act like Jesus while others would act like Hitler. The Jesuses will never peacefully coexist with the Hitlers (papatayin sila!). But if they choose to live according to their principles, and not retaliate, I think "inner peace"
