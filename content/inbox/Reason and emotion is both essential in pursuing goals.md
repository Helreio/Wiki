# Reason and emotion is both essential in pursuing goals

Emotion fluctuates based on one’s physical and mental health (sleep, nutrition, stress, etc.) One needs to stick to one’s original intentions especially if those went through careful and long deliberations. That said, it is important to keep an open mind to the feedback that emotions give us especially those that affect the details of a certain project. These feedback may contain vital information we need to change course before it is too late.

The optimal strategy is this: Do not make the two fight each other but make them work together.
