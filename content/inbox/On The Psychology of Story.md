# On The Psychology of Story

Authobiographical Reasoning

⁃ Identify lessons learned or insights gained in life experiences.

⁃ Mark development or growth through sequences of scenes.

⁃ Show how specific life episodes illustrate enduring truths about the self.

Take stories around you then identify with them and borrow them while fashioning your own self-conceptions.

Actors -> Agents -> Authors

Authors - bundle ideas about the future with experiences from the past and present to form a narrative self.

Rehearse telling your story so it becomes more accessible and memorable to you. Plus your listener can react and therefore enrich the story through back-and-forth conversation (talk therapy).

Redemption sequences - Bad -> Better - Greater well-being

Contamination sequences - Better -> Bad - Poorer mental health

Redemption

1. Optimism - Things will get better!
2. Exceptionalism - I can make things better!

Finding positive meaning in negative events is linked to a more complex sen of self and greater life satisfaction.

Agency - you are in control of your life

Communion - You have good relationships in your life

Agency and communion improves mental health.

Writing life events in a narrative form helps more than just listing them.

Be a highly generative person - be caring and committed to helping future generations. Tell stories about others who helped you in the past.

Organizing the past in a narrative isn’t just a way to understand the self, but also to attempt to predict the future.

Find a unity in your narrative identity. Try to fit everything.

The way you imagine your future will also affect how you see your past and the past informs the future.

You’re both the narrator and the main character of your story.
