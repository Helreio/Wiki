# Early treatment protocol for Covid using ivermectin

If you suspect that you have [[Covid 19]] and you are experiencing symptoms, follow these steps as part of your [[Covid 19 treatment plan]]:

### Phase 1. High-enough dose for 3 days.

Take [[Ivermectin]] doses based on your severity of symptoms:

- Mild = 3 doses
- Moderate = 4 doses
- Severe = 5 doses

Take the doses on a single intake.

If you achieved significant improvement after 24 hours, treat the dose you previously took as your “high-enough dose”. If not, increase the dose for one more dose every 24 hours until a high-enough dose is reached.

Once a high-enough dose is determined, take this dose for 2 days.

Watch out for the following side effects:

- drowsiness
- dimming of peripheral vision
- patterned vision
- visual changes
- disorientation
- hallucination

If you experience any of these side effects, you have reached a high-enough dose or even exceeded it. Take the next lower dose for the next 2 days.

### Phase 2. Tapering doses.

After taking the high-enough dose for 3 days, start tapering the medication by reducing 1 dose each day until you reach 2 doses.

If symptoms return, go back to high-enough dose.

### Phase 3. Maintenance dose.

Maintain 2 doses until complete recovery.
