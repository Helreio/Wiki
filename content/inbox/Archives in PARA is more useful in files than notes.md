# Archives in PARA is more useful in files than notes

I find that I no longer need [[PARA]]’s concept of Archives for my notes. I simply need Resources. The entire [[Zettelkasten]] houses resources, because everything there is something I am interested in, something I could share to others, and something I can retrieve to use for future projects. It doesn't make real sense to keep notes that you will just put into Archives, which is a place for things you just don't want to throw away.

But I do see how the concept of Archives makes sense in old files from really old projects that are not really actionable. We just need a place to keep some things that we are keeping for the sake of keeping—sort of like antique artifacts, whose sole purpose are aesthetical and sentimental.
