# State and Pinoy IPs

Most of the area that we now call the Philippines were once territories of indigenous people. If you believe on the sovereignty of Philippine state and its government, then it means that you also approve the displacement of thousands of indigenous peoples from. And don’t tell me that the IPRA or any state mechanism protects or upholds the interests of IPs because they don’t need protection if they were left behind in the first place.
