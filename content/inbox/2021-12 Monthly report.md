# 2021-12 Monthly report

# Summary

This month, I was able to articulate my sharing strategy, which also involved updating my review systems (because what I review gets shared). I was also able to practice my improved Talahardin workflow while reading A Philosophy of Walking, a beautiful book that introduced me to thinkers I’ve never thought more about like Rousseau and Nietszche. Because I was inspired with this book, I took more intentional walks this month and wrote narratives about them. At home, I was able to finally resolve my flea problem and built a minimum viable workstation that has improved my back health. Still an extension of thinking about how I share my work, I started studying website design and development with the intention of relaunching the best version of vinceimbat.com. Along the way, I learned about Linux, the right to repair, and Jamstack. At the end of the month I was able to implement a new simple budgeting system to help me control my spending. On other things, I traveled to Manila this month to meet Lea’s friends and celebrated Christmas with Lea and her extended family for the first time.

# Projects

## Flea infestation

- I was able to resolve the flea infestation in the house using a noninvasive strategy that includes using Advocate, Vet's Best Anti Flea home spray, vacuum cleaner, and laundry.

## Walking

- I tried out writing walking narratives that combined writings about what I saw and thought about during each daily walk. I wrote the narratives under my daily notes.
- Walked to Tadlac Lake and wrote a narrative of it.

## Workstation

- I installed curtains in my workstation (and sala), finally.
- I assembled the ergonomic chair.

## Design vinceimbat.com

- After doing a metalearning session, I decided to study Flux Academy’s free Web Design course because it tackles both technical topics and design thinking processes.
- Learned about the different tools in designing a website and developing it.
- I discovered Jamstack.

## Linux

- I came to the realization that Linux is an OS I definitely want to try in the near future.

# New Laptop

- I realized that I wanted to run all three OSes in a single machine.
- I want to have a repairable and upgradable laptop.
- I don’t like Apple products anymore.

## Budgeting

- I implemented Fitz Villafuerte's advice on budgetting.

# Areas Evaluation

## Life System

I worked on my zettelkasten for a while at the beginning of this month, as a continuation of the previous month’s thinking. But I let go of this project to follow what interests me. That said, I did improve my Talahardin workflow by implementing a short research cycle and improving how I convert literature notes to permanent notes.

## Physical Health

Perhaps my biggest improvement in this regard is improving my back health, lessening my back pain by buying a standing desk and an ergonomic chair. I also can’t deny the noticeable improvement in my throat and reflux symptoms. That said, I gained weight this month and increased my visceral fat to 11, but decreased it back to 10 eventually. My average weight this month was between 196 and 198 lbs. My eating and sleep habits are also less optimal than usual.

## Mental Health

I finishe 2021 with half an Exulten and everything was fine. I am now ready to lessen my dose. I continue to take walks that ground me.

## Relationships

My relationship with Lea has been well although I must admit that it was less exciting this month than the previous months. Nevertheless, I continue to enjoy her company and I bonded with some of her friends and family members more. This month, I let go of Fruit Salad to give more space to myself and new people. I got to bond more with Bevs and Embi as well as Adrian and Gelai.

## Sustenance

I updated my budgeting system after feeling like my spending is getting out of hand and I am desiring more material possessions than I am used to. I found Fitz Villafuerte’s strategy and looking forward to experiencing it next month. That said, this needs more than a simple budgeting strategy. This year, I need to reevaluate my system completely and update it. Meanwhile, it has been a month of standstill and Nics has yet to go back to me about editing. I have to think about where I want to bring this outsourcing project altogether. I worked at Scribendi mostly choosing short orders. The first day was easy, the next days were difficult, and the last day was particularly taxing. I got two 1 start feedback, one needing a redo. I might need to reevaluate how I want to continue with Scribendi in the coming year. Should I invest time in improving as an editor? Or is it time for me to transition into a new trade?

## Life Work

This month, I started reading A Philosophy of Walking. I experimented with writing walking narratives that combined accounts of what I saw and thought. I had to let go of it because it was taking more time and I need to prioritize writing a more detailed daily review about my studies and projects. I updated my sharing strategy and decided to design a website that will be a wiki where notes from my Talahardin will take shape as publishable thought pieces. I also plan to publish monthly updates. I started studying website design and development closer with the intention of launching the best website I will have so far. Along the way, I discovered more of the world of opensource, website builders, Jamstack, etc. I have also updated my review routines to make them integral to my sharing strategy.
