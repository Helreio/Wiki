We believe that you have ideas of your own.

Contemplation is a viable lifestyle and we have models to follow.

There are tools you can use to make the process of solitude and contemplation easier and enjoyable.

We believe that although truth is desirable, compassion and kindness are more important than being right. Esp because beliefs are too complicated and contentious.

Contemplation is very relevant in fostering this world of tolerance.

Compassion training towards ourselves and others
