Spending more time with people predicts whether you will be happy or unhappy.

Epley & Schroeder (2014)

- Talking to strangers make us happier.

Just by being with other people, we take in information in a very different way.

Boothby et al. (2014)

- Even if you are doing something with a stranger you donâ€™t talk to, it still affects how you experience something. It becomes better.
