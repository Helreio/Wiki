# 2020-07 Monthly report

## Summary

As the quarantine measures relaxed further into MGCQ, I was able to experience the “new normal”. The biggest challenge of this month was the problems that Gripo and Oreo exhibited. Both of them probably were poisoned. I took care of Oreo but soon experienced compassion fatigue. Their situations will worsen, but despite this, this month was still fruitful as I began exploring and pouring myself out into Caroline Miller’s goal-setting workbook. I coupled this with studying Tiago Forte’s Annual Review process, which I turned into a mid-year review. From his process, I realized that I needed to set scarier goals and that my bigger project was not really building a philosophy of living, but building a life system.

## Good Events

- Rode my bike to San Juan up to San Jacinto to see what happened to the place since the lockdown
- Watched a kingfisher intently
- Applied what I learn from The Science of Well-being by cooking with Lean and Jacob, doing things with people via video chat instead of just talking with them
- JUWA happened
- First time to go out to town (buy at a pharmacy and withdraw money from an ATM) since the lockdown.

## Setback and Challenges

- Problems with Gripo started.
- Problems with Oreo also started. I took care of her for the most critical part of her poisoning. There were lots of emotional struggles involved. I realized that I still experience compassion fatigue and I doubt that I am the right person to serve pets and people who go through what Oreo went through.

## Personal Triumphs

- I optimized my Weekly Review by combining my old process with Tiago's.
- Wrote my Best Future Self in a state of FLOW.
- Wrote my Purpose and Mission.
- Even if I was uncomfortable and unsure, I did my best to be present with Crystal’s plight.
- Donated money to Franz
- Helped Dave, an American PT who is thinking about freelancing.
