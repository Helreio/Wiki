But can’t happiness really be the purpose?

Why shouldn’t it be pursued? Because it is a by-product of pursuing a selfless goal.

What am I being called to do?

What research is saying isn’t that happiness shouldn’t be the ultimate goal. What it is saying is that the way towards happiness is not through pursuing it but through pursuing these other things that lead to it as a by-product.

It is like meditation. If you keep on thinking about achieving transcendental experiences, you won’t achieve them. You achieve them by focusing on the breath on the practice.

At the same time, we shouldn’t be too preoccupied about the destination (happiness or Ginhawa). What we need to focus on are the practices that we need to do every day, the middle strivings that get us to the mental states we desire.
