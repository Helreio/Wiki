# How I write a walk narrative

I try to walk every day. I take photos if I want to practice mindful photography. I also write field notes. But I don’t write about all of my walks. Doing this everyday like [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]] did ([[The fieldwork routine of Thoreau]]) is too time-consuming especially because I don't have (yet) a bigger context where such project belongs.

However, I do have walks that have to be written as they document important destinations that other people might want to visit. If that is the case, here is the process I follow in writing a walk narrative:

I usually simply piece together what I saw and think about yesterday using photos and field notes.

(Elaborate here…)

An interspersed essay of a walk + thoughts from my research about "how to live?"

So i am combining two projects in one

- walking
- Researching how to live

I need to have a note taking app that has time stamps to each entry

I wanted to live and then narrate that for a living. My life is too boring as is but esp when I stay at home. I need to do something worth narrating. And so I take brief and long walks. Then talk about them.

- stats per day: kms/steps
- Narrations of a walk or a general description of what I noticed.
- interspersed with what I thought about that week (the interspersal happens when a thought relates to somwthing that happened in the walk). The thought can be my insight or something I read or listened to somewhere else

After a narrative has been written, I could extract an excerpt and share it with a photo on Instagram and Facebook, and engage with commments.
