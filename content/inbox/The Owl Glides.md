# The Owl Glides

Over the golden heads of rice

The golden heads of rice

Magestic

On the hour of the sun's descent.

And the owl glides

Its wings encompassing

The entire field

As I sat there

Nothing to say

On the hour of the sun's descent.

The owl glides

In circles

Spiraling above

The golden heads of rice

Then it dove under the heads of rice
