# Mas Masaya Project

NAs

- [ ] Accomplish all To Dos in the course.
- [ ] Think: Should I publicize the process?

Doing something in public means you need an audience. What audience will you be presenting to? What audience do you have in fact? Is it even wise to relate something so personal with an audience?

If I am going to do this in public, what can I do?

- Use the forums
- Use the group
- Use social media
- Use my blog
- Use my newsletter

I think it’s best to use the group itself because they are the people who will most benefit from the updates.

1 weekly update per week, which contains

- A list of activities done
- Assignments
- Reflections
- [ ] Print the workbook
- [ ] Send email to newsletter that you will be participating in the Science of well-being and you will provide updates about this project.
- [ ] Make daily updates on social media.
- [ ] Rewirement tracking
