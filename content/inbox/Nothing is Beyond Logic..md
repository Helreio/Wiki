# Nothing is Beyond Logic.

Nothing is beyond logic.

The sentence:

"There are things beyond logic" is a claim.

All claims require the concepts of "truth" and "falsehood"

Truth and falsehood require logic.

Therefore, even the sentence "There are things beyond logic" requires logic for it to be intelligible.

Logic is as necessary as my need to breath so that I can stay alive.

Logic is as necessaey as why what I throw up in the air eventually falls down.

Logic is the rules of how we think, how we experience things, and how we talk about these thoughts and experiences.

Logic separates the sane and the insane.

Logic is not good or evil.

It is value neutral.

Logic is just how things really are.
