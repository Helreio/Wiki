# Common sense metaphysics

When a lay person is asked, “what exists in the world?” ([[thoughts/metaphysics]]), the common sense answer would constitute the following:

- Physical objects exist.
- Boundaries of the thing are objective, determined by the laws of physics.

The problem with this common sense notion is demonstrated by the following question:

- If a part of the object is removed, is it still the same object?
