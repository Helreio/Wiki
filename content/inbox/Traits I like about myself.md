# Traits I like about myself

Kids like to be around me because I can be at their level.

I notice those who are less appreciated and I get to know them.

I am sensitive to the needs of others.

I am sensitive when somebody is hurting someone and I act to help.

I appreciate silence.

I appreciate solitude.

I am willing to walk.

I have an unquenchable desire to learn
