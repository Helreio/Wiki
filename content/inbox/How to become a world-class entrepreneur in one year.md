# How to become a world-class entrepreneur in one year

**NOTES**

Apprenticeship

**Combine study of abstract principles with real-world projects that apply the abstract principles.**

Do it as an extended learning sabbatical.

**If you’ve got a year’s worth of savings, do the startup.**

**Use your own experience of starting the startup to identify what are your specific weaknesses**

- Now, you already have a few years of freelancing under your belt. Maybe you could use that to pinpoint your specific weaknesses.
- **Then, while you are starting the startup, be on the watch to catch other weaknesses that show up.**
- **Look for curriculums that would help you target those weaknesses.**

**Some skills**

- **Entrepreneurial finance**
- **Copywriting**
- **Design**
- **Marketing**
- **Networking**

**Your learning will not come from a curriculum. Instead,**

- **Identify deficits.**
- **Do little projects to get you better at these deficits.**

**Use scaffolding.**

- **Look for mentors (master-apprentice relationship). Very valuable in this context.**

Meta-learning

- Expert interview method: **Interview successful founders.**
- **Listen to interviews on their journey.**
- **Talk to people who failed.**
- **Look for answers to the following questions: what are the things that matter, what are the things that they got good at, what skills were important, which ones didn’t matter?**
- **Use expert interview for each sub-skill involved in entrepreneurship.**

**Don’t think of starting a startup as one ultralearning project. Think of it as a series of different ultralearning projects where you are working on the startup but, at the same time, acquiring adjacent skills that are going to be helpful for that.**

Focus

- Balance the two: **work on the startup and work on learning the things that you need to do the startup.**
- **You could overlap the two.**
- But you may still need to read a book or go through a tutorial to do what you have to do.
- **But use the startup itself as a guide to get you to focus on what you have to do first or what you need to learn at particular times.**
- Learn how to schedule.
- Tackle: How can you avoid procrastination? How can you avoid distraction? How can you make sure that you’re working on the right things?

Retrieval

- **As long as you work on directness in learning entrepreneurship (read: start a startup), retrieval will take care of itself.**
- Retrieval will be very useful when you are reading.
- After reading a book, practice or apply the advice immediately to retrieve.
- If info cannot be applied immediately, use retrieval techniques.

Feedback

- If you are building a startup, you’ll be getting feedback all the time.
- **Mistakes: (1) Not get enough feedback (because you don’t tell your idea because it might be stolen). (2) Not getting feedback from your target market. (3) Expecting a level of granularity that doesn’t actually exist.**
- **Three types of feedback: outcome, informational, and corrective feedback**
- You could get the wrong feedback from customers. Customers don’t know what they want. Customers get an intuitive feeling about your project but when you ask them why they feel what they feel, they don’t know the answer so they confabulate some reasons to support their intuitive reasoning. Problem: Even if their intuitive reasoning is accurate, the reasons behind them may not be.
- **For corrective feedback, get a mentor.**
- **But still be wary of feedback because your mentor may still have limited experiences, so they may not provide all the right answers. Don’t overreact to feedback.**

Retention

- Will not all be relevant as long as you focus on directness.
- Unless your startup depends on a lot of memory work.
- Just use it when reading.

Intuition

- Chunking model: understanding through large volumes of experience where we learn patterns. Successful entrepreneurs have a lot of patterns that they’ve learned that you haven’t yet.
- How do you understand hard things? Use the Feynman technique.

Experimentation

- Experimental mindset = Entrepreneurial mindset
- Think in terms of what you’re trying to accomplish when we’re dealing with mastering creative skills, as exploring a higher dimensional space.
- So when we’re dealing with entrepreneurship, there’s pricing, there’s capitalization, there’s all sorts of these little different variables. And they’re not entirely independent, but they’re also something that we’re often trying to explore when we are creating products and services that work. That we’re not just trying to create something that’s optimal, we’re trying to create something that’s original. We’re trying to create something that is new and varies in ways that other people don’t expect. And so, I think there’s aspect of exploration can be quite valuable, because it often suggests things like, for instance, that pursuing the extremes of things is often more valuable than just picking the middle, simply because it allows you to explore more of the space of possibilities.

It’s not about reading one book, it’s about reading 50 to 100 books.

- Establish a habit of reading 20-30 books a year that would build your library of ideas.
- **Get many perspectives as possible.**

Use books to solve problems.

**Read books while you’re actually doing the thing you’re trying to get better at.**

Learn lifestyle entrepreneurship.

He took Ramith Sethi’s zero to launch course to learn how Ramit teaches and delivers his course, because it’s a best-selling course.

**Always study other business.**

It’s how you’ll get good at business.

Once you master the basics, it’s difficult to find books or resources to get you better because most of them are made for beginners.

**In the mastery level, study exemplars.**

- **Growing business: Ramit Sethi**
- **Writing: James Clear, Cal Newport, Malcolm Gladwell.**
- **Blogging: I find a handful of blogs that I really like how they’re doing things, and I’m sort of figuring out, okay what are the things that they’re doing that I like? And what are the things that I can bring on to what I’m doing in my own work or my own business?**

**Business problems are closer to artistic problems.**

Good classes to take at community colleges (better yet, just find books)

- Financial accounting
- Managerial accounting
- Corporate finance
- Corporate law

**Marketing textbooks expose you to more concepts than some random marketing book.**

**The mentor-apprenticeship analogy is the prototypical immersion environment.**

**As well as starting a startup, being in an incubator, or being part of a community of entrepreneurs.**
