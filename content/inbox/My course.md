Smaller modules under

The entire curriculum is modular

Students take what they need

Understanding the world better

One's understanding of the world informs systems

A different worldview will produce different

But in my worldview:

- it is possible to describe a framework of how we make sense of the world, a description that is neutral

In my worldview:

- there is a description of facts: what exists
- Which is separate from conceptual values

People can benefit from the systems and methods I create without really going deep into the philosophy behind them.

The philosophy behind them are for people who want to get deeper. To think better. It is an advance module.

A brief explanation of theory. Can be an intermediate module.

A longer explanation of theory. Can be the advance one.
