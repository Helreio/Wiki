# Quotes on fame

“People who intentionally become famous — I mean people who, after a little taste of fame, want more and more of it — are, and I honestly believe this, deeply psychologically ill. The fact that we are exposed to these people everywhere in our culture, as if they are not only normal but attractive and enviable, indicates the extent of our disfiguring social disease. There is something wrong with them, and when we look at them and learn from them, something goes wrong with us.”

—a novelist in Sally Rooney’s *Beautiful World, Where Are You?*

“It’s easy to trust that fame is a deeply mixed blessing, but everything that rock stars (literary and otherwise) seem to have discovered about that fact is simple and repetitive.”

—[John Williams](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/books/review-sally-rooney-beautiful-world-where-are-you.html), review of *Beautiful World, Where Are You?*

“There’s nothing about fame that I’ve ever seen that’s healthy. It is something that is very hard to survive and has no intrinsic value unto itself.”

—Shep Gordon, [*Supermensch*](https://amzn.to/3kXNeS3)

“Fame in a world like this is worthless.”

—Marcus Aurelius, 121–180 A.D.

“In many ways, fame is the industrial disease of creativity – it’s a sludgy byproduct of making things.”

—Mike Myers

“Fame is hollow. It amplifies what is there. If there is any self-doubt, or hatred, or lack of ability to connect with people, fame will magnify it.”

—Alanis Morissette

Fame promises freedom from worry about the opinion of others only to trap the aspirer inside an even larger audience.”

—Leo Braudy, *The Frenzy of Renown*

by lime light.”

“Celebrity, even the modest sort that comes to writers, is an unhelpful exercise in self-consciousness. Celebrity is a mask that eats into the face. As soon as one is aware of being ‘somebody,’ to be watched and listened to with extra interest, input ceases, and the performer goes blind and deaf in his over animation. One can either see or be seen. Most of the best fiction is written out of early impressions, taken in before the writer became conscious of himself as a writer. The best seeing is done by the hunted and the hunter, the vulnerable and the hungry; the ‘successful’ writer acquires a film over his eyes. His eyes get fat. Self-importance is a thickened, occluding form of self-consciousness. The binge, the fling, the trip — all attempt to shake the film and get back under the dining room table, with a child’s beautifully clear eyes.”

—[John Updike](https://austinkleon.com/2021/08/09/celebrity-is-a-mask-that-eats-the-face/)

“The only thing that comes from fame is mediocrity.”

—Sleater-Kinney, “[Hey Darling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nt249kXiOU)”

This very same “indignity of being observed” is what so many seek.
