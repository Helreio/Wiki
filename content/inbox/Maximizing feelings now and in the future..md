# Maximizing feelings now and in the future.

Balance now and the future.

If this is the goal then I am not doing it the right way.

I do not feel good NOW.

And like every good THING happens in the FUTURE.

I need to work on NOW to at least feel better.

How to feel better

1. Environment
2. Body (matter)
3. Thoughts (mind)

Environment affects body which affects the mind which affects how I feel.

Environment affects mind which affects how I feel.

3 ways to feel better

1. Change environment (may take some time to do so)
2. Change body (may take some time to do so)
3. Change thoughts (can be done sooner than the too)
