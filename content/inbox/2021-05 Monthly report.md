# 2021-05 Monthly report

# Summary

This month, I met three wonderful people (with their two fur babies): Sarah, Cris, Makiling, Acacia, and Lennon. Sarah introduced me to free birthing. Her stories inspired me a lot this month.

This month was also a month of walking. I familiarized myself with the streets near my house, and finally able to follow through my project of discovering trails available around me. I discovered three spots on Laguna bay (two in Baybayin and one in Mayondon). I was also able to bring my friends in those spots. I also climbed Jamboree road once and discovered the most beautiful path in UPLB.

I spent a lot of time improving my financial life this month. My focused study fixed how I managed my emergency fund, invested my portfolio, and understood insurance options. It’s not yet full proof, but a minimum viable system is already in place. I am also looking to improve cash flow by considering outsourcing my editing work.

In terms of creativity, I was able to launch and maintain a newsletter: Lilim. It was simple enough for me to do. And being able to maintain it is working wonders with my self-confidence. I also experimented with publishing photo essays in FB and IG. My exposure to Craig Mod also improved by joining his Special Projects membership.

I experienced growth in responding to Diwa’s reprimand and deciding to stop being friends with my ex again.

# Insights

- Communicating with my ex was a futile activity. I stopped.
- Diwa reprimanded me about publishing Sarah’s story without letting them know. This led me to think about the repurcussions of my actions and dealt with emotional ebbs and flow of what happened. We later on made ammends and I’m looking forward to a deeper friendship.
