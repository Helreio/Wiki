# The SARS-CoV-2 Genome: Evidence of its Artificial Origin

**Presentor: Associate Professor Michael Palmer MD**

Li-Meng Yan

The immune system can recognize all proteins of the virus, while the artificial vaccine contains only one protein: the Spike protein. The vaccines are inherently inefficient.

The spike protein needs to bind perfectly to its host’s receptor for the infection to succeed. Host receptors look differently in different species.

It was initially reported that the SARS nCOV 2 virus was originally isolated from a bat. This means that the spike protein of the corona virus should bind with bat receptors. However, the very first strains of the virus bind better with human receptors rather than bat receptors.

Yan compared three strains: the wuhan strain, the strain from a bat, and the SARS strain. The bat strain had gaps that the wuhan strain filled. These gaps were also filled by the SARS strain. This made Yan conclude that the wuhan strain was derived from the SARS strain.

The derivation happened artificially. **The likehood that the strain evolved was 1/24 million.** On the other hand, the probability that the virus was cultivated in a lab is 99%.

Yan’s work was not published in a peer-reviewed journal.

SARS-CoV-2’s purported ancestry based on peer-reviewed science

- Ancestral virus genomes were faked in the lab.
- A parentral strain told to be isolated from bats binds bat cell receptors very poorly.
- Chinese researchers say the strains come from Malaysian pangolins, but no coronavirus in pangolins.

The traces that the virus was indeed artificial were left in the strains. It was not difficult to remove them. They forgot. Probably, they were rushed.

Everyone now agrees that the corona virus is a lab-made virus.

**The fraudalent studies about the natural origins of the virus remain in peer-reviewed journals. None of the studies were retracted. This sheds light to the quality of peer-reviewed science.**

Does the virus exist?

- The clear answer is yes. The virus exists. The strain has been isolated in many independent labs. The identification of the virus after cultivation was confirmed in various ways.
- Sinovac exists. An inactivated virus.

Which function increased when comparing SARS-CoV-2 to other common coronaviruses?

Most coronaviruses infect only the respiratory tract and have little effect on other tissues. The coronavirus was optimized to infect other tissues outside the respiratory tract. COVID affects heart muscle and even the central nervous system.

Another unusual feature of the virus is that it recruits other receptors aside from the receptor it is bind to. COVID is analogous to a bat coronavirus, but the spike protein of COVID is very poorly matched with bat receptors.

The most likely explanation of the origin of the virus:

- The SARS virus receptor-binding domain was extracted and modified in vitro. It was then transplanted into a recombinant virus the backbone of which was derived from a real bat virus. So the virus looks like a bat coronavirus, but its receptor is derived from a human virus.

Chinese researchers claimed that the virus came from pangolins.

A follow-up study was done in Indonesia, testing hundreds of pangolins and none had the virus.

We need confirmation from independent labs, before we make a conclusion that pangolins are indeed a source.

What is special about the new strains of COVID virus?

If you really want to create a reliable picture of mutations of the virus, you will have to fully sequence every single virus isolate. This is not done yet. This is never done in any virus epidemic, simply because it is not warranted.

Mutations are still very similar to the parent virus as far as our immune system is concerned. Our immune system recognizes all viral proteins in SARS COV 2 (about 10,000 amino acids). If five of them changes, the immune system will still recognize the virus.

- The immune system is stronger than any vaccine.
- Delta variant talk is useless in other viruses. It is just in COVID that people are reacting too much about it.

A virus is not interested in making you sick. It just wants to propagate. If it makes you sick, it confines you in the bedroom, where it cannot infect others. So a virus that causes mild disease, which does not disable a carrier, will have a better chance of this carrier transmitting the virus. The virus will prefer a healthy host than a sick host. Therefore, mutations go to the direction of attenuation than greater disease severity.

If you get severely sick, you will develop a more vigorous and more long-lasting immune reaction to the virus. So it is in the interest of a virus’ survival that it does not kill you.

Artificial gain of function research optimized the virus, but natural evolution will get it back to equilibrium. It is expected that the virus will reduce pathogenicity.

The virus is actually underperfoming.

The release of the virus was rushed, which means that there is a lack of thorough testing in humans before it was released.

Conclusion

We can scientifically demonstrate that the virus was created in a lab. What we cannot demonstrate is if it was indeed released in progress—via by accident or in purpose.

If the release was accidental, there will be a cover up and downplay the severity of the incident. Covid is not as virulent as influenza viruses. The reaction should have been to minimize the gravity of this incidence. The dangers of the virus have been maximized. Not minimized. This implies that it is possible that the virus was released in purpose.

# The Laboratory Pandemic

**Presenter: Ulrike Kämmerer**

Established the use of RCPCR

Problems

1. Are there coronaviruses in the swab sample?
2. If yes, which type of coronavirus?
3. Which amount (what viral load)?
4. Is the detected virus able to replicate and make the infected person infectious?

Problems

1. Are there coronaviruses in the mixture?
2. If yes, which subtype of coronavirus?
3. Which virus genome number?
4. Is the virus able to replicate or infect?

The PCR can never decide if the whole virus genome is in the sample. This is because, the PCR only detects a small piece of the whole gene. Furtheremore, the target organism is destroyed for the analysis.

The PCR cannot tell you if the the type of virus can replicate.

PCR using the Cormon-Dawson protocol. International experts criticized this method. It is still use to classify status of infection.

- The design of this PCR was not good.
- It produced a lot of false positives.
- PCR is okay to use for research in very rare genes. But a PCR is not a valuable method if you want to determine flu-like disease.
- PCR is not credible to clasify people as infectious
- You can only amplify a small piece of the gene. This piece can either come from an infectious virus or a virus that was killed by your immune system

For the first time in medical history, a single lab test was used to discriminate between healthy and sick people.

Sensitivity - how many of the target can you detect in a sample. the higher the sensitivity of a test, the lower the amount of targets you need to detect them.

Specificity -

- This is not done in the majority of PCRs worldwide.

The testing now is getting better, but in the beginning, the tests were very problematic.

Authorities did not agree with the number of genes to use: from 3 genes it became 1 gene (for mass testing). The lower the targets you have, the higher the rates of false positive.

The PCR can be performed safely and valuably but it was not done in the majority of testings. Majority of the results were incorrect.

**PCR is not the method of choice to detect respiratory virus or corona viruses. Stop it. Go back to the roots: Medical doctors decide based on the symptoms of a person, who is ill, and who needs to be treated, independent of the test.**

# The False Pandemic

**Presenter: Denis Rancourt**

All cost mortality is not reliable.

The mortality ascribed to a viral respiratory disease is not reliably ascribed. You need full autopsy to do that.

Pandemic definition

1. It occurs everywhere because it assumes that prior immunity is not available. It does not respect geo boundaries. But we see signs that mortality numbers change from jurisdiction to jusrisdiction.
2. Pandemics cause many deaths. Pandemics cause 5-50 times more deaths than the usual viral epidemic. You have to see this upsurge in all cost mortality.
   - When you look at all-cost mortality, there is a spike in the winter and a decline in the summer (in mid latitude to high latitude countries). Mortality in summer are consistent. Mortality in winter are eratic (some are high, some are low). Winter deaths account to 5-15% of yearly mortality consistently since the 1960s. If you have a pandemic, you are supposed to rise above that. But the evidence does not show it. What we see is an integrated mortality that is the same as usual.

What you see in the graph is there was an immediate surge after the WHO announced that there is a pandemic in March 1, 2020.

- This Covid peak does not occur in some countries. If we are in a pandemic, these numbers should be consistent in geographic boundaries. You can see this inconsistency down to the county level.

It’s all about how the measures are applied.

All around the world, mortality in respiratory disease went down to their usual numbers during the summer. The exemption was the United States. They had a huge peak. The peak was geographically located in the Souther states with a lot of poverty abused by restrictive measures and employment problems.

What is clear is that there is a clear bias in attributing the cause of death to Covid, especially in the middle of a media frenzy where you are talking about a pandemic. To resolve this problem, look at all cost mortality. All the other measures are unreliable garbage.

In the US, there definitely was a rise of increase in deaths due to respiratory diseases. It was caused not by the pandemic but the war against people and the economy. Because it was extremely granular. It did not occur consistently.

In France, 30,000 died because of Covid measures. Old people were locked in care homes where they were not treated. Not given antibiotics. Not even checked if they had bacterial infection.

According to the literature, if there is an epidemic, remove old people from care homes and treat them. The opposite was done.

# The Power of Masks

Conversation with: Harald Walach

There is very little evidence in the use of mask.

In every day situation, when you are dealing with just one person, they might be effective.

But in a community situation, there is no evidence for that.

N95 was used to protect one from dust, not virus. 75-90 mins of usage, mandatorily followed by a 30 min break. Does Covid justify that all of these rules are put out of order?

Forcing children to wear masks for a prolonged period of time results to problems because even just 3 mins of wearing these, carbon dioxide builds up.

JAMA retracted their study. It is a clear breakdown of scientific discourse. Professor Walach have seen that happen in recent times.
