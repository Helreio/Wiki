# Further rational and observational proof for free will

There has to be a label to differentiate an obvious difference between a robot and a duck.

Even if there are inanimate forces that influence a duck's actions, it still seems to show a particular measure of control over its actions unlike a robot which relies completely on a controller for how it should act.

This stark difference is because of consciousness made possible by subjective experience.

As long as there is consciousness in the equation, a fact that I can't deny, there is reason to believe that free will exists. And with it, a sentient being's desire for freedom.
