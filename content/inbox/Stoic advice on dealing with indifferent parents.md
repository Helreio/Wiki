# Stoic advice on dealing with indifferent parents

You can't control the actions of others, only your own.

Your father pays no attention to you so quit trying. You

have made this your problem when it is his problem to

be rational. Just ignore him and concentrate on your

own concerns. Be the best person you can be, in terms

of virtue and application of reason, and perhaps this

will rub off on him when he sees how much of a better

life it is to be so.

I do not know that you have to love them. You just have to play your role in the family as best as possible. There are families that the parents are worse.

It's our own egoistic need to

'set others right' which is

the problem. Becoming aware of that is crucial.

Epictetus explicitly states that we aren't entitled to

'good' parents - only parents.

Does your father attempt to belittle you and act like a

big baby to protect his own fragile ego? Well, you do

not have to compulsorily feel 'offended' by it.

You're already on the right track.
