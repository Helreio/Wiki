As long as you cant experience the physical world in the same exact manner that I experienced it, then i can't conclude that there is nothing that makes me unique. It doesn't matter what you call it. I am unique in a way that I can safely conclude that there are clear boundaries between me and you and between me and the world.

That uniqueness that differentiates me from you, it is not the body. The body, being physical, is dependent on the rest of the physical world. I might be persuaded to think that the body is one with the world.

But that uniqueness within me, that exclusivity that I hold, whatever it is, the grand mystery. That is separate from the rest of the world in a fundamental categorical way.

And that separation has nothing to do with how I treat my body and the rest of the physical world.
