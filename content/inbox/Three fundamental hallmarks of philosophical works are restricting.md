# Three fundamental hallmarks of philosophical works are restricting

The [[Three fundamental hallmarks of philosphical works]] are restricting. Between strict philosophy and [[Lenient use of “philosophy”]], there has to be a middle way. For sure [[Philosophy as belief is different from philosophy as discipline]]. But the first hallmark of philosophical works should have been enough.

Once a conscious individual—even a child—asks questions about foundations, this should be enough criteria for philosophizing. The other two hallmarks might already be unnecessary. Or we could still make them viable but we should stop referring to them as something exclusively done by academia.

Children ask questions about foundations and present arguments to answer such questions. They could also use philosophical methods or theories based on certain traditions, although unconsciously. So long as they are engaged in this process, they are already philosophizing.

Furthermore, they don’t have to write their process. We need to stop feeding [[The hegemony of the written word]]. Of course, it is ideal to have records and documentations of someone esle's thoughts so that we have concrete stuff to refer to and work on. But oral documentations should not be discarded. They should be part of any collection of philosophical works.
