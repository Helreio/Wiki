# Tinnitus Affirmations

The noise could sometimes be unpleasant but I can cope with it!

The noise can sometimes be a nuisance, but there are so many things in life I enjoy!

I am not alone. Many people suffer from tinnitus and many live a happy life despite it.

- Tita Loida has lived with it for years
- Rainier has lived with it for four years
- Ate Donette has lived with it for two years
- Tito Danny has lived with it for one year

Some nights I will have sleep difficulties because of tinnitus and anxiety, but not all nights will be this way.

- Actually, most nights since onset, I slept pretty well and my sleep has improved a lot because I am now compelled to sleep before 12 MN
- My anxiety attacks were also significantly decreased to the point of nonexistence.

My life was good then tinnitus happened. Obviously, it changed, but it doesn't mean that no good will ever come after tinnitus or that it's impossible to have something better after tinnitus.

Tinnitus is just one aspect of my life. There are many other beautiful parts of it.

Just because I have tinnitus now, doesn't mean it will get worse.

Being able to manage my tinnitus today is a great achievement. Every single day is progress.

It's okay to feel upset about my tinnitus sometimes.

Having tinnitus and hearing loss does not mean I am totally disabled.

I believe that there is a big possibility that my tinnitus will get weaker or be gone completely. But if my tinnitus does not go away or if it gets worse, I'll still be okay because I will still be able to habituate.

My tinnitus is not all negative. There are benefits from having tinnitus. I could use it as a point of focus during meditation. I could use it as a gauge to tell me the state of my health. It has taught me a lot so far about coping, taking care of my hearing, and body. I still hope it disappears. But even if it stays a little longer, I'll be alright.
