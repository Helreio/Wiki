Agreeableness - Moderately low

I am less tolerant of people who practice a belief system different from mine. But I would like to see a pluralist society, where no one is forcing his belief to anyone.

I am always skeptical. That is right.

My only problem is I am not always able to express my disagreement because of my politeness and moderately low assertiveness.

Since I am low in agreeableness, I need to work harder in:

- Being more sympathetic with the feelings of others
- Being more interested in people.
- Compassion - Moderately low
   - The results here seem really harsh. My value of individuality and personal freedom seems to be really highlighted. Compassion towards others is done only as a service to the self. Either this is what I believe to be the right behavior because it is the logical conclusion. Or this is what I believe because I am less other-oriented.
- Politeness - Typical or average
   - This is the reason why I find it difficult to express my disagreement sometimes, and why I still respect authority outwardly even if I don’t like it inwardly. I avoid conflict but also confront others when needed.
   - This is also the reason why I find writing a better way of expression. I can be freer to disagree when not in a social situation.

Conscientiousness - Typical or average

The results of this dimension is something I agree with. I am conscientious but I am also desire flexibility at the same time. They balance each other out. This is the reason why I am attracted to Taigo Forte's system as well Austin Kleon and zettelkasten, systems with some structure but open to iteration and new feedback. I don't usually feel guilt. This also explains why I appreciate excellence but I am not too overly ambitious. I don't aspire for achievement that much.

- Industriousness - Typical or average
- Orderliness - Typical or average

Extraversion - Low

I expect that I am low in extraversion. But to know that I am specifically low in enthusiasm and assertiveness is enlightening.

Because I am less extraverted, I am less sensitive to positive emotions when in social situations. Social contact is draining to me. I am more likely to be depressed and have lower self-esteem. I am also less optimistic.

It’s easy for me to keep quiet and not express my truth. I don’t easily warm up with people. I like one-on-one interactions than group interactions. It isn’t easy for me to express opinions but I am compelled to do so sometimes. I don’t totally keep silent. My weakness will be public speaking or captivating and convincing people in groups. Especially because I can be high in neuroticism (anxiety, OCD, etc.). These are difficult things for me to do.

I will never dominate social situations. This is because I have low aggreeableness and low extraversion. I will tend to criticize others but will not do so outwardly, so I’ll just keep quiet or resort to passive aggression. Nevertheless, I don’t appear self-centered becuse I keep my disagreement to myself and I am more polite.

My strength lies in the one-on-one interactions, indirect work, etc.

- Enthusiasm - Very low
   - My default feeling is tanquility. I don’t always feel enthusiastic. And even if I feel it, I don’t outwardly show it. What I show as enthusiasm is almost always artificial.
   - I prefer going to Nature than being stimulated by noisy, rowdy environments.
   - I can handle social contact in small doses.
   - I actively avoid the spotlight
- Assertiveness - Moderately low
   - I am disagreeable, but I don’t want to assert. This creates passive aggressiveness. A weakness of mine would be expression of what I feel.
   - This is the root of the feelings of inadequacy and handicap. I feel like I am very knowledgeable and capable, but I am not very assertive. I am not very extraverted. I then compare myself with my peers who freely express their beliefs. It can feel like a handicap sometimes.

Neuroticism - Typical or average

I should have been above average on this dimension, if it wasn't because of meditation and other psychological tools and practices that help me cope with everyday life and struggles. With this dimension, I am able to take moderate risk but also remain calculated in my actions. I want to maintain my current status or enhance it.

- Withdrawal - Typical or average
   - I feel fear and anxiety for the uncertain. But I don’t completely withdraw from it. It’s the same thing that happened when I did impromptu speaking competitions in high school. I was anxious all the time. But I won anyway.
   - I am now easier to bounce back from sadness. I have more propensity to experience negative emotions. But I have adopted healthier behaviors that take me back to center. I just have to learn to enhance that center to feel more positive emotions. To feel Ginhawa.
- Volatility - Typical or average
   - As with withdrawal, it is easier for me to get back to center even when triggered to be volatile.

Openness to Experience - Moderately high

This is also fairly accurate. Although my more focused consumption of information may have influenced my control of this openness.

This is my strongest dimension. This is what produces positive emotions in me: novelty, art, literature, abstract thinking, philosophy, aesthetic emotions, and beauty.

While I am high in openness and disagreeable, it is difficult for me to lead innovation because I am less assertive.

Multipotentiality can be explained through the Big Five. Multipotentialites, who are originally people who can’t decide on a career track, are people who are high in openness (making them interested in many things), high in neuroticism (worries a lot), and low in conscientiousness (unable to organize things or be decisive). Multipotentialites who eventually settle on a more focused path or an integrated identity are those who have lessened their neuroticism and improved their conscientiousness.

- Intellect - Moderately low
   - This is the only result that I disagree with. If this was typical or average, I may still have accepted this. The truth is that I like complex ideas, but there is always a side of me that wants things to be easy, to feel good, and too much hard ideas prevent this. The truth that is behind this result is that feeling good does not require too much intelligence. I can feel good even if I don’t understand the world entirely. Furthermore, the ultimate service of information is to improve experience. This is the reason why I would like to be a writer of personal narratives instead of a researcher. I want to translate complex ideas into easier to understand ones. I made a mistake here. I believe I am typical or average in intellect.
   - If I am not too high in intellect and low in extraversion, that explains why I have some difficulty communicating my ideas.
   - One reason why my intellect is less that I expected is that I am more of a slower thinker than a faster one.
- Opennes - High
   - Creativity
   - Loves beauty and wants to be surrounded by art (Nature included).
   - This apprecition comes from sensitivity. I am sensitive to colors and forms.
   - I can easily flow and be thoroughly immersed in thought, imagining and reflecting.
