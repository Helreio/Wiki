# Why

I found a hut

A small hut

A small wooden hut

At the middle of the field

As the night starts its ascent

As I walk this narrow road alone

I parked the bike I trailed beside me

On one of the fragile posts of the hut

Then I went inside

I sat

My legs dangling over wet grass

My behind slumped over hard bamboo

And looked at the horizon

Orange, blue, and black

Mixed into one

For all the people who have walked this path today

Why was I the only one

Looking at this sky

As the crickets chirp

And cicadas sing

Why why why
