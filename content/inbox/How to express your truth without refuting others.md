# How to express your truth without refuting others

You can [[Express your truth without refuting others]] through the following strategies:

1. Express your belief in a story-based manner—through the lens of your story—in a way that just narrates and describes—not refute beliefs. This helps everyone understand that [[We hold our beliefs because of our unique experiences]]—not because our belief should be adopted by everyone. From the point of view of the listener, this humanizes a belief that is foreign to them. They may discredit your belief, but they can never discredit your experience.
2. Be prepared to answer questions and tell what you believe in clearly when asked.
3. Live your beliefs. Let your actions tell what you value, what you believe in.
4. Only debate when invited or when having a dialogue is necessary for your well-being or to build a particular relationship or group dynamic.
