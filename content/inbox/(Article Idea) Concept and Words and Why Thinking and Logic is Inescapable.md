# (Article Idea) Concept and Words and Why Thinking and Logic is Inescapable

Imagine that i am one of the first apes to think.

What happens when I see a plant?

From here, the primal action is simply being aware of its existence.

but the moment i became aware, almost instantly, i have also formed a concept.

My mind thru my brain have interpreted what my eyes saw as a separate form.

And also almost insantly after being aware of the form, I am called to think of this thing as a separate entity in need of an identity. Almost instantly i need a tool to help me make this happen: concept.

At this time, the almost automatic process comes to a halt. It is sufficient that i am aware and that i have created a form and an identity in my mind. But this process leaps into another level when I need to communicate my experience, that is: my awared seeing of a form. I need now create to try to transmit my conceopt to another person the best way i can. At this leveli need to use the tools nature gave me, my mouth and my voice. I create sounds that signify my concept.

Now my friend living kn the same place have seen the flower and because he too is beginning to evolve, he is capable of havjng a simikar experience. Note, similar, not the same. Because he has different eyes, different brain, and different mind, he has a different but simolar experience to me. Our experienc3s are not one and the same. They are unique to us. And yet yhey are similar becajse we looked at the same entity present in the physicsl space arou d us.

He has his own fsculties and he can create his own unique mix of vocal sounds to sig ify the concept of the flower in his mind. But if he has his own mix and i have my own mix we wont know what each other is refering to. We have similar concepts but we cant communicate because we are using different words. We misunderstand each other.

Now it is for our benefit that we are able to communicate what we mean so we will have tk agree to use a single mix of vocal sounds to refer to this form we saw in our place. We agreed to use flower.
