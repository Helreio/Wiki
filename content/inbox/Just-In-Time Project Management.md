# Just-In-Time Project Management

### General Theory of Work

What is your general goal in working?

- Your goal is to manage where you put your attention.

How should you design your workflow?

- Design your work in a way that you experience rewards in the present moment (in minutes, ASAP) while also increasing the likelihood of future benefit.
- Design your work so that you experience a series of small wins that put you in the mood to pursue even more.

How do you make sure that your workflow rewards you now and in the future?

- Deliver value quickly in small chunks so that you experience motivation now and build something valuable in the future.
- Each and every session, create packets of knowledge.

How do you design a project?

- Because there is so much uncertainty in your project, dive and take action instead of planning everything in advance.
- Your project is primarily a learning process where your priorities are:
   1. Research
   2. Testing
   3. Discovery
- Gathering, planning, and implementing should be interwoven into one thread.
- Every project is made up of subcomponents.
- Build systems and routines that allow you to respond at the last minute.
- Look at yourself as a project portfolio manager.
   1. Choose the right projects to start.
   2. Maximize project completions.

What is the general workflow or setup you should follow?

1. Clearly summarized packets of knowledge (through Progressive Summarization).
2. These packets are then organized according to actionability (PARA).
3. Combine these packets into valuable deliverables right at the moment they’re needed.
4. Have the 16 workflow strategies on hand to use when needed.

What is a second brain?

- A second brain is a system of people, software, and organizations working together in a decentralized way, with your own personal efforts dedicated to tweaking and tuning how the system operates.

Why build a second brain?

- Build a second brain to have a system to turn the flow of random ideas into stocks of valuable knowledge. This makes it possible for you to make a dent in the universe and live a happy, balanced life at the same time.

Why are states of mind important?

- Your states of mind are your most precious resource, because they are the surface evidence of what’s happening in the deep underground channels of your psyche.

### Planning a Project

1. Create a project entry in Things. Duplicate this entry in Evernote, Finder, etc.
2. Define the desired outcome of the project. Describe what you want and what success looks like. Write it in the present tense. Use action verbs.
3. Set the project’s deadline. Except for a few projects, the deadline of most projects will be flexible. If you are unable to finish the deliverable on the deadline, the deadline will be used as a review date to assess what needs to be done next.
4. Set the schedule for deciding, combining, and producing as late as possible ideally on a date very near the deadline.
5. Write a tiny brief of the project, which outlines Who, What, When, and Why.
6. Create a metaplan for the project by writing down all the desired outcomes connected with the project.
7. Expand each outcome into smaller projects needed to achieve it. Define these small projects to break up big undertakings into little, manageable projects that you can systematically work through.
8. Create an Evernote notebook for each project.
9. Create metaplans for each smaller project.
10. Collect all sources, notes, and resources in each project’s notebook.
11. Use the beginning of the project (your first intermediate packets) for ideation, experimentation, drawing on other disciplines, researching, summarizing, and annotating.
12. Focus on collecting things (ideas, theories, possibilities, options, features, and questions). Avoid putting structure, features, and purpose this early. Allow these to emerge from the material.
13. Schedule regular reflection on the project to extract clear feedback from your experiments.
14. Set new actions based on this feedback.
15. Do not over plan. Make the iron triangle (time, budget, and scope) of the project flexible.
16. Two choices: leave the purpose, goals, outcomes, and problems to be solved ill-defined at the beginning, allowing them to emerge slowly as you make discoveries OR set them precisely but remain open to radical revisions as you test your assumptions.
17. Break down the big project into intermediate packets to make sure that you generate small wins. You can also break down the big project into smaller projects made up of intermediate packets.
18. Use the following criteria to generate good packets:
19. Answer questions or test assumptions
- Need to be done anyway
- Simplify or speed up future projects
- Make future decisions faster or easier
1. Design ever-evolving intermediate packets that allow you to perform exploratory actions that test your assumptions. For example, think of the smaller and simpler version of what you want to create and ship that.
2. List these packets or features according to priority and use this list to decide what to work on and deliver each work session.
3. If you want to launch something, launch a container and fill in the features slowly over time via releases - discrete packets of incremental value delivered to users. Or launch a version 1 of your product, which you iterate later on.
4. Seek maximum contact with reality and allow your project to evolve according to feedback.
5. Define steps to open up your project to your network.

### Managing all Projects

1. Use the Weekly Review to put your projects in priority order. Ask: Do they reflect my long-term goals and values?
2. Arrange your projects in a logical sequence. What needs to come first? Look for dependencies upon one another.

### Guidelines on Choosing What to Work On

1. Always have multiple projects to work on. This assures that you have other projects to turn to when you are stuck. Multithread between projects to make progress on many fronts simultaneously.
2. Allot your deep focus on
3. projects that expand how many CUs you have available (i.e. establishing a repeatable process)
- projects that take CUs to build but not to maintain
- the most unique and valuable work you can do
1. Allot your mild and light focus on projects that improve the quality of your CUs (i.e. meal planning or exercising).
2. Kill projects or commitments that consume a disproportionate number of CUs for the return they produce.
3. Choose the task at hand based on your emotional state.

### Working

1. Start a work session by choosing one intermediate packet/deliverable to work on.
2. End your work session with a clear deliverable: an intermediate packet and a placeholder.
3. At the end of a work session on every project, create a placeholder to freeze your project and know what to do on the next session.
4. Send your deliverable off for feedback.
5. Use the feedback to define next actions.
6. Always make sure that you have wins in every work session you enter into.

### How to Create a Packet

A packet needs to be SERC (Stateful, Encapsulated, Reusable, and Composable)

1. Stateful - It has to save all preceding events or user actions. Collect all content relevant to a project into a centralized location where it can be organized.
2. Encapsulated - It has to be packaged up into a discrete, self-contained unit (a note). Separate your content into small packets with clean edges (i.e. notes).
3. Reusable - It has to be designed in such a way that it will be recognized and understandable at some future date without too much extra effort. Design notes for easy search and retrieval. Organize your notes by project and topic. Add meta-data to the note.
   1. Informative titles: Describe accurately and succinctly what this note contains.
   2. Thematic tags: Include tags that label the note according to common themes.
   3. Concise summary: Summarize briefly what this note is about so your future self will know if it’s worth reading in its entirety.
   4. Comments and annotations: Add your own comments so your future self will know what you thought about this note.
   5. Bolding and highlighting: Call out the best or most interesting parts so your future self won’t have to find them again
   6. Links and images: Include different types of media, which can make future review more engaging and vivid.

4. Composable - It has to facilitate easy and quick combination into more complex packages. Practice composing things. Make retrieval easy by:
   1. Searching (for keywords, titles, or terms)
   2. Filtering or sorting (by date or other criteria)
   3. Browsing (perusing notebooks or folders that seem relevant to the task at hand)

### 16 Workflow Strategies

Mix and match the workflow strategies that make the most sense for you and your work. Use them with each new project, making small tweaks and improvements each time.

Before using them, ask the following questions:

1. Diagnosis: What’s the problem?
2. Guiding policy/direction: What approach will we use to seek our solution?
3. Action Plan: How will we implement that solution?

### 1. Archipelago of Ideas

- Collect a batch of starting ideas from the most relevant notebooks, which you then just have to string together. You can collect these ideas in your notes slowly over time, summarizing the words or phrases that resonate the most, and when the time comes to put them to use, create an outline with the ideas that seem relevant for the project at hand.
2. ### Headings First
- Lay out the major headings or stages of the project, giving you a roadmap to fill in as you discover what’s involved.
- As new ideas pop up, place them under the correct heading. These headings can be stages in a timeline, titles of chapters in a book, sections of a report, or pages for a website.
3. ### Color Commentary
- Add personal comments directly in a note and in a different color.
4. ### Status Summary
- Briefly summarize, in plain language, the current status of the project for the benefit of your Future Self, including details, remaining tasks, open questions, problems remaining, observations, personal commentary, or next steps. You can add it at the top of the note you’ve been working with, as a reminder of the state of mind you were in at the exact moment you left off.
5. ### Meta-Plan
- List tasks you’ll complete on the way to completing your deliverable.
- Make a checklist of the places you should look or the sources you might want to consider.
- Check each item off as you review it.
- You don’t have to precisely follow the plan. Just look at a broad range of ideas.
6. ### Temporary Tags
- Using tags, keep track of which sources or notebooks you’ve already reviewed, except as you come across them, instead of upfront.
7. ### Naming Conventions
- Standardize on a common format that reveals the most relevant features of a note in a highly visible way.
- YYYY-MM-DD - CONTEXT/CONTENT - CREATOR INITIALS - VERSION NUMBER
- Don’t apply the same naming convention to every single note in your collection.
8. ### Tag Hierarchy
- For especially complex or collaborative projects, organize your notes through tags to facilitate easy search.
9. ### Interlinking Notes
- Link one note with another.
- Link one note to external places.
10. ### Table of Contents
- Evernote includes an automated way of doing this, by selecting and right-clicking on a group of notes and clicking “Create Table of Contents Note”.
- Add your own commentary under each link, describing how you want to use each note in a current project. You could send it to a colleague or collaborator as a compendium of your knowledge resources on this topic. Or you could use it as a personal reading list over a period of a month.
11. ### Advanced Search

![](Just-In-Time%20Project%20Management.assets/%20(2).png)

12. ### Brainsweep
- Do a global search across your second brain so you can see all those bits in one place.
- Collect all notes in one place then do any of the following:
   - Create a saved search for the term.
   - Move all the notes to a new notebook if you think this topic will become more important in the future.
   - Tag the notes with the name of the current project you’re working on, and then remove the tag from each note as you review it, as a way of tracking your progress.
   - Merge or combine notes that are similar or duplicated, so it’s easier to review them in the future.
   - Go through the list of notes and extract the best parts, writing them up in a blog post.
   - Specific to Evernote: look in the Context panel at the bottom of notes to see any related notes.
13. ### Dial Down the Scope
- Reduce the scope or size of the deliverable you’re working on to be able to make consistent progress.
- The most effective ways to get started is just to pick a very small version of the thing you want to create.
14. ### Context Switch
- Change your context, which includes your environment, surroundings, state of mind, mental and bodily state, and approach.
- Try reading or viewing the information on a different device, switch locations from inside to outside or vice versa, or put the project aside to return to later with fresh eyes.
- Share it with a colleague and look over their shoulder as they read it.
- Read aloud what you’ve written, which activates different parts of the brain and will help you imagine how others will receive it.
15. ### Sentence Hacking
- Remix the words and phrases you come across in your research, so that they suit your needs.
- Add your own interpretation.
- Create internal structure in the document, such as pasting phrases from different sections into a single list, or adding headings that weren’t in the original but are meaningful to you.
- Cut and paste different sentences together, to express the ideas in a different way.
16. ### Function Follows Form
- Reframe what you’re looking at:
   - Chronologically: put a series of ideas or steps in chronological order
   - Prioritized: sort a list by priority, or importance, or urgency
   - Sequentially: put items in order by function, or by stages in a workflow
   - By objective: put each item in a list under its objective or desired outcome
   - By size: order items from largest to smallest, or the reverse
   - By theme: re-order a list by theme or topic, looking for patterns or groupings you didn’t see before
   - Question-answer: rewrite your ideas in the form of questions and answers
   - By shape: try mapping your ideas to different shapes like a circle, square, triangle, or hexagon, looking for any interesting patterns

### Structuring Notes

Add status sections at the top of notes. This allows you to pick up where you left off even with large gaps of time.

- Current Status: What actions have been taken? Where has it been used?
- Social Context: Who recommended it? Who’s collaborating? Who did you share it with?
- External Context: What other notes, docs, and folders relate to it?
- Internal Context: What thoughts, feelings, and concerns do you have about it?
