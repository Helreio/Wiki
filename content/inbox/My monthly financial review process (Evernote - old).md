# My monthly financial review process (Evernote - old)

Here are the following steps of my monthly financial review.

1. Open Evernote.
2. Go to the notebook stack 02 Areas > Finances 01 - Monthly Tabulation.
3. Check that a new note for the monthly tabulation of the past month is available at the top of the notes (e.g., July 2021 MT).
4. Compute your monthly income from the following sources:
- Paid work (Scribendi)
- Bank interests (BPI, EastWest, CIMB, ING)
- Others
2. Complete logging your monthly expenses in Dollarbird by checking expenses from the following sources:
- BPI debit card
- BPI credit card
- ING debit card
- CIMB debit card
- Paymaya debit card
- Lazada app wallet
- Shopee app wallet
- Gcash app wallet
3. Log breakdown of expenses in Evernote.
4. Calculate Total Expenses and bold.
5. Calculate Ending Balance.
6. Go to 02 Areas > Finances 02 Monthly Liquid Assets.
7. Create a new note and entitle it with something like this: August 2021 MLA.
8. Copy the format of the note from the previous note.
9. Calculate for Total Monthly Liquid Assets by logging the current balance of the following:
- BPI
- EastWest
- ING
- CIMB Gsave
- CIMB FastPlus
- Tonik
- Moneygment
- Lazada Wallet
- Shopee Wallet
- Paymaya
- Credit Card
- Gcash
- eToro
   - Determine how much your eToro contribution is in Php from the past month by looking at your CIMB FastPlus history.
   - Add your eToro contribution with your total eToro contribution last month. You do track this beforehand, so you can just refer to [[private/List of money invested in eToro ]].
- COL Financial
- COL Financial dividends
- eToro dividends

Since you are doing this calculation on the first day of the month, do not forget to include in your Monthly Tabulation all expenses you incurred in this first day.

10. Copy your Total Monthly Liquid Assets and paste it under Actual Ending Balance in the Monthly Tabulation.
11. Calculate the difference between the Ending Balance and Actual Ending Balance and write it down under Unaccounted For.
12. Copy the entire table.
13. Create a new note in the same notebook (Finances 01 - Monthly Tabulation).
14. Entitle the notebook using the format Month YYYY MT, using the coming month’s name.
15. Paste the table in this new note.
16. Delete all numbers in this table except the Actual Ending Balance.
17. Cut the Actual Ending Balance and paste it under Actual Starting Balance.
18. Open Google Drive.
19. Go to 02 - Areas and open Vince’s Financial System.
20. Fill in the month and year.
21. Fill in your income.
22. Fill in your expenses.
23. Fill in your monthly investment income (calculate using the formula here: [[Monthly investment income]])
