# Some people feel awe when encountering a logical contradiction

Some people upon philosophizing come into a logical contradiction. When they get there, an emotion is produced: awe. This is because the logical contradiction seems unreal and yet it also seems true. Awe leads to reverence and emotional reasoning. People feel like the logical contradiction is true just because it is mysterious. They use the word “paradox” to refer to it. What they don’t realize is that the definition of truth requires that a paradox isn’t true.
