# This One Colorful World

I do not know

if I am still alive tomorrow

so I am writing this poem

a love poem

about

this colorful world

that I did not ask for

but was given to me

about

laughter and sorrow

abundance and scarcity

calm and anxiety

bliss and struggle

about

a hungry child

and the blue heron

that just passed by

about

bombed cities and bodies on the streets

and the gumamela

that just blossomed

about

human sardines stuck inside a bus at 9 in the evening

and the mackerel sunset

my last sunset

I do not know if it I am still here tomorrow

but if I am

I will wake up

knowing that I have written

a poem

a love poem

about

this one colorful world

every single bit of it
