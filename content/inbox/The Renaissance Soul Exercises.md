# My Big List

Write all the things you believe you want to do before you die. Write a more active list; not places you want to see but interests you’d like to explore: things you want to do, learn about, make, collect, and create.

List anything and everything that interests you, that has ever interested you, or that might ever interest you if you live to 105 years old.

Include:

➢ Everything you’ve done already.

➢ Everything you wish you could do for the first time.

➢ Everything you wish you’d be doing all through the years to come.

➢ Everything you’d like to do once or twice only.

Before you make an entry, you must sit for a minute or so, with your eyes closed if you can, and imagine yourself actually involved in that activity in real time. Be there as much as you possibly can.

If the fantasy feels as good as you had hoped, it passes the test and can go on the list. If it’s scary but thrilling, it also goes on the list. But if it’s just the title of some field that appeals to you, be sure to think about it carefully before you write it down.

You can give yourself a few days to finish this exercise.

**MY BIG LIST**

# True Passions Worksheet

TRUE PASSIONS WORKSHEET

**Advice to Your Former Self**

Hello Vincent (version 2009)! It is okay to challenge the status quo. It is okay to follow the desires of your body. It is okay to masturbate and be as promiscuous as you like if that is what your nature and your body is telling you (but of course, do it safely and responsibly). It is okay to reject religion and embrace freedom. In fact, I encourage you to choose freedom. Outside religion, there is a wonderful world that you don’t need to enjoy with others. You can enjoy life while embracing your introvert nature. It is not true that it is a sad world outside the congregation. No. The world outside is vast and wonderful. You just have to discover it yourself and plot your life towards your interests.

Don’t take life as serious as what you are doing. Take things slowly. **Love the process and don’t get stuck with a schedule of achieving all your cherished goals. Every day is more important than that day when you get to achieve your goals.** **Battle your perfectionistic tendencies and your desire for status.** Status means nothing to creative people. **What is important is you define your values and live your life in harmony with them so you feel inner peace and a sense of direction.**

Stop on the path you are walking through right now. That will lead to total peril which will happen on March 2011. Roughly two years from now. Take care of your physical and mental health. Don’t kill yourself.

**The Magical Moments Exercise**

**I was creating my own comic strip. I was able to create a story good for at least seven chapters. I was doing it alone and my creativity was really on the go. I was able to draw and write the story in a simple notebook. I enjoyed creating the characters and the world they lived in. I lost this notebook. I wish I kept it with me. (Artistic, alone)**

**I was writing a script for a role play at school. Actually, I did this a lot during high school and I enjoyed the process of creation, writing and directing the play. I enjoyed every bit of it, from the shortest 5 minute play to the longest 45 minute play. I was basically working alone when I created the plays but I worked with a group when executing my ideas. (Artistic, alone, leader)**

I was with Precious. Lying on the bed. I totally forgot about time and all of my problems. For me, it is still the most magical moment I’ve ever experienced. Time stopped and I don’t want it to end. (Lover, with Precious.)

I was running with childhood friends under the heavy rain. I felt free. My mother and father didn’t care. I just ran and play. (Child, with friends)

**I was reading books about my previous religion. I understood the concepts and it inspired me to read and read more. I felt like I have a purpose in life. (Alone, student of the Bible)**

Reading the Romanov Prophecy.

Laughing with friends at Tokyo Tokyo.

**Your Perfect Day**

I wake up at around 6:00 AM. I hear the birds chirping and the leaves rustling. Sunlight is entering my room through big windows. I wake up in a beautiful house, a house which is simple but artistic and elegant. I have a room which I designed myself. As I pull out of bed, I kiss Precious who is still sleeping under our white beddings. **I walk towards my desk filled with papers, pens, drawing materials, sketches and things that inspire my creative process. Beside my table is a book shelf with lots and lots of books. My room is filled with artistic images that enlighten my day.**

I check my schedule for the day and after that, I walk out of the house on my running shoes to have a short walk. It is around 6:30 AM and I plan to take a walk while meditating so I brought my pencil and paper with me. I walk out of our simple house which is near a nature trail. I walk on this trail listening to the music of nature and looking at the fog filled environment. **As I walk, thoughts start to circle around my head—thoughts for my new fiction. I am working on creating a new fantasy world with lots and lots of interesting characters and twists. I draw my own characters and design my fiction world.** Suddenly, the thoughts stop and my mind shift towards a calmer mode.

I begin to realize how thankful I am for my personal freedom and my life. I take a few relaxing breaths then I realize its 7:00 AM and I have to go back home for breakfast. Back at the house, Precious has just prepared a healthy meal. We ate together laughing and expressing intimate love gestures. After our breakfast, since she has to go to work, I accompanied her out the street where she rode her own car while I am left at home with my own thoughts and a brand new artistic day waiting for me.

My entire day is just filled with lots and lots of meaningful and artistic activities—composing a new song with lyrics and music, interior designing, writing scripts, editing videos for my new documentary and indie film, painting, drawing sketches, etc.

By 11:00 AM, I could feel that my creative power has slowly diminished so I prepared my own lunch while watching my favorite TV programs. I ate my lunch then checked my email and social network (artists, writers, bloggers, multipotentialites, depression survivors, etc.).

By 1:00 PM, I felt a little sleepy. It is my nature to sleep in the afternoon. It is the call of my body. So I read a fiction book while lying down on a bed at a kubo near our house, surrounded with trees, greeneries, flowers and running water. As I finished a chapter or two, I felt sleepy. I slept and woke up at 3:00 PM.
