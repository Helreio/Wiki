# A preference to anarchy is subjective

Going from zero to anarchy is not an objective route. It is a biased, subjective route to say “I value freedom and I want to maximize it.”

What if there is a danger to focusing on a single value over others? Freedom is a dominant value for sure but there are other values that we also seek: justice, for example.

But can we argue that freedom is the base from which all values are achieved? I’m not sure. We can arbitrarily designate anything as something of value. If one values health, then one can argue that without health, freedom is useless, or without nature, health is useless.
