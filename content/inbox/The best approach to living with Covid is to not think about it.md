# The best approach to living with Covid is to not think about it

[[A life shouldn’t be lived in fear]]. But that is what is happening right now with Covid. People live in constant fear—fear if their neighbors, fear of the virus. And in a way, fear of the vaccine.

The best way to approach Covid is related to the best way to approach deat ([[Stop obsessing over death]]). And it is related to the best approach to finances—that is, to not think about it.

Perhaps spend a few days clarifying you stand. Take action, then after that, return to your real interests and passions. Stop tracking the deaths and every single news item about it or your position. Just live and do what you have to do.
