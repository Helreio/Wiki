# My current stand on the Covid 19 vaccines

Given the fact that the tests we use to classify infection status are not credible, the enlarged numbers of infected individuals have created a false pandemic. The false pandemic created an atmosphere of fear and emergency that led to hastening the production of vaccines. The vaccines were released prematurely.

The vaccines are not in a stage where I am 100% sure about them. The efficacy of the vaccine is supported by peer-reviewed journals. However, peer review is flawed ([[Peer review skepticism is reasonable]]). Because of peer review and politics within academia, flaw in medical thinking permeates the entire industry. Given this, it is highly plausible that adverse effects of the vaccines are underreported and their effectiveness is questionable. Therefore, skepticism on the vaccine is justifiable.

The use of the the vaccine is part of a bigger narrative that I do not agree with. That narrative runs around one word—fear. The use of masks, the lockdowns, mandatory vaccinations—these all come together to create a world where freedom is curtailed for the sake of a false sense of safety, when the severity of the threat does not justify the measures taken. The narrative of fear is tightly connected with authoritarianism. This by itself is enough for me not to take them. I would rather get the virus and get cured by available treatments than put this thing in my body that has no data on its long-term effects.

I don’t want to be part of that narrative. I want to be part of a narrative where I trust my immune system more than unproven vaccines, where I reject authoritarian measures to curtail human freedom, where I put my trust on marginalized scientific voices that work from reason and truth, and not power and greed.

Hello love, inintend ko na isulat ito today. First order of business.

This is probably just a reiteration of what I already told you the other day when we were at the pancitan. But I’ll repeat it here for the sake of clarity and for you to have a written reference din to go back to in case you need it.

This is about the vaccine—that boring, frightening, pest of a word. I just want to get the ball rolling and bring some measue of direction on this issue of ours—if not a sense of finality.

Let me start by clarifying my stand.

Will I take the vaccine right now? No.

Why? I am not certain enough that its benefits far outweigh its risks and I feel uncomfortable with its manner of distribution to society.

I base this stand on two levels:

1. Science
2. My personal values

On the level of science, I need to do more work on my certainty levels. I am not sure whether the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks. All I know is that there are lots of compelling evidence on the dangers of the vaccine. My latest discovery about this is the excellent work of the award-winning journalist Sharyl Attkisson, who regularly updates this page: [https://sharylattkisson.com/2021/11/exclusive-summary-covid-19-vaccine-concerns/](https://sharylattkisson.com/2021/11/exclusive-summary-covid-19-vaccine-concerns/), which contains studies and reports about adverse effects of the vaccine. The fact mahal is that “there are risks”. Even if the chances you get them are low—something that is possibly untrue—they still exist. What surprised me from Attkisson's page is a study she linked to that reports possible effects of the vaccine on the brain. The study is from the Journal of Neurology: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00415-021-10780-7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00415-021-10780-7). Now, this concerns me because, as you know, I have a very fragile brain. I am taking antideps for more than 10 years already and it has definitely altered my brain. I do not share with you everything that I am feeling within my mind, I am not sure I can even do that because it is so difficult to explain. But I am in the process of tapering from my meds and I don't want to do anything to my body that would make things worse for me and make tapering difficult moving forward.

Having said that, I am not a hundred percent sure about my hesitance. Maybe I’m wrong maybe I’m right. The point is: right now? I cannot make a good informed decision. I am just not ready to do so. One of my philosophical principles in life is skepticism, which involves taking actions based on one’s level of certainty. For example, my certainty that I want to marry you and be with you forever is 100% or maybe close to that, like 97% (nababawasan ng 3% yung certainty levels ko kapag nakakalimutan mong pataying mga ilaw lol). And so my motivation to, say, propose to you or magpalakas sa nanay mo is strong. I cannot say the same thing with this vaccination issue. My certainty to get vaccinated is not even close to 50% right now. It’s in all time low honestly. And so I don’t have a strong desire to get vaccinated urgently.

Now that is just on the level of science. Ibang usapan pa yung sa level of my personal values. As you know, I deeply value freedom. It’s the reason why I am a freelancer who is ready to do marathon work for 5 days straight. It is the reason why I am an anarchist. I believe in a world where individual freedom is optimized. I believe that the freer we are, the healthier and happier we are. Given this, I am deeply uncomfortable with how these vaccines are dessiminated. The mandates are controlling, discriminatory, violates people’s freedom, and are based on this general narrative of fear. Even if I become 100% sure that the vaccines work and are not risky, I am not sure I will partake in a very authoritarian medical regime. I want to help build the world I want to live in through my actions. Even though those actions seem irrelevant in the larger scheme of things, I still want to do my part.

To be completely honest with you, I wanted to start this new 30 day free month period to continue working on my Talahardin and hopefully to start the How to Live survey project I’ve been wanting to start. Given my current understanding of the science behind the vaccines and my personal values, my decision is to stay unvaccinated for as long as possible—that is, until I have a stronger grasp of the science behind it and the benefits of getting a shot far outweighs the risks. And this is why, on my own, I currently don’t see this as a priority to spend my time on.

However, I am in a relationship with the most gorgeous, sexy, beautiful, smart, and kind woman in the universe. You are the most important person in my life right now and I care deeply about you. Because of that, I will change my priorities for this month and allot more time on this issue for gathering more knowledge about the science and also gathering resources and connecting with groups that could help us live a good life despite staying unvaccinated. However, here’s the catch—I will only do this if you want me to, if you really need my help. I don’t want to do this when you don’t want to do it with me, or if you have already made a decision to take the vaccine.

Your mom’s shotgun question yesterday took me aback and made me realize how real the pressure is to you to get vaccinated. But I also thought I cannot stand up for you all the time and I am not even sure if that is something I want to do. I want to be in a relatioship where the other person can stand up by herself—independent, strong, principled—so that, if I am unable to do that for myself (because something bad happened to me or I just got depressed again), someone will stand up for me. You are a strong woman. You probably doubt that but you are. And there is no better way to summon that strong woman in you than right now. I hope you could make up your mind. Will you share my stand, and ask my help to know more about the situation, which will take time—lots of it? Or are you no longer willing to wait or are just convinced that it is the right thing for you to do to get vaccinated right now?

If you need more time to think about this decision, and you want me to help you (because I know you don’t have the time to do research, and you don’t necessarily enjoy it), just tell me, and I will spend a good chunk of the month researching this again.

But if you want to get vaccinated na, I will put this thing aside and return to it when I need to. If this is the path you choose, from here on… If you choose to take a different stand, although we will still support each other in most areas of our lives, this will be something you will have to navigate for yourself moving forward, since sobrang magiging iba ang trajectory mo sakin kapag nagpabakuna ka. You will have to be ready to face the consequences of your action, whatever that is. Similarly, I will make decisions about this issue on my health whenever and however I want. But what you will expect from me is this: unconditional love and support. If something happens to you after the vaccination, I will be there to do everything I can to support you, even if you took a different stand from me.

Of course, kung ako lang ang masusunod, I want you to share this stand with me. I want you to make health decisions based on research, critical thinking, and truth, and not peer pressure. I want us to navigate this crazy pandemic world together no matter how difficult or uncomfortable. I want you to develop critical thinking even if it is uncomfortable and not your strong suit. It is something that I plan to teach our children anyway, even if you don’t share this value with me. This is how deeply important this is for me—to be cautious always, act only based on certainty, and to always be searching for the truth, no matter how uncomfortable and slow the process will be.

For some reason, I remember that night when I was in Las Piñas with Rem and Benjie—the night when Digong announced the lockdown. You called me and you told me there that “We will go through this together, okay?” And we did! When I got here at Laguna after almost a year of not seeing you and being with you and started a new life with you, I thought we’ve made it na talaga. Little did I know that this pandemic is not over for the both of us—for this relationship. Until the world gets over the brouhaha (not soon unfortunately as there is a new variant they are panicking about once again), we will have to live with it and make tough decisions and face the consequences of those decisions.

I am just so grateful that I have you with me right now as I go through all of these. I will love you until the end no matter what your decision will be.
