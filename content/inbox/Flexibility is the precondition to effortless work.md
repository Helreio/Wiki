# Flexibility is the precondition to effortless work

Effortless work is work where we are kept interested and motivated. We are only interested and motivated when we are allowed to follow our personal work rhythm. We can only follow our personal work rhythm if we have the [[Freedom]] to do so. [[Freedom motivates us]] and allows us to follow our curiosities ([[Use curiosity to guide your thinking]]). Autonomy creates a flexible system, which, in turn, leads to effortless work.
