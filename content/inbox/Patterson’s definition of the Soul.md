# Patterson’s definition of the Soul

Soul is simply the first person entity that has a direct causal relation to the body.

A soul is a person with a first person perspective that is meaningfully different from other people’s first person perspective.

Where your person ends is the boundary of your soul.

Mental phenomena exist and they can’t be reduced to physical phenomena.

Physical phenomena exist and they can’t be reduced to mental phenomena.
