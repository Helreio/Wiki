# How to Write a Personal Essay by Joyce Maynard

# Introduction

Before you write a memoir, start with a smaller version: the personal essay.

You don’t want to write about your entire life.

One thing that is good about writing a personal essay is that you can finish one faster.

A personal essay is also easily publishable in internet publications.

A personal essay is a glimpse of your life but it is not:

- an anecdote
- a journal entry
- a rant
- a poetic reverie
- a tribute to someone you love
- a part of a collection

A personal essay is a small window to the bigger story of your life: who I am.

The voice you use to write in a journal is different from the voice you use to write to the world.

What personal essay is for Joyce is that it is a STORY made up of motion and change. A poetic reverie almost does not move. It’s like a photograph.

For Joyce, writing a personal essay is all about communicating a story. This means that the reader is more important than the writer’s own processes.

The best place to read tributes to people is New York Times Obituaries (a good place to start your day).

- An honest writing should include both negative and positive sides of a person

Start writing one really good personal essay. After you’ve done that, take the skills you get and go on to the next.

For 8 years, every Monday, Joyce delivered a thousand-word essay.

Don’t start dreaming to write a collection. Start with one essay.

Why write a personal essay?

Read the New York Times Modern Life Column to read personal essays.

We write the personal essay for personal satisfaction, to be known to say, “Let me tell you what I’ve gone through.” It will connect us to people who could be moved and helped by our story.

“In my opinion the best way to help a reader is not to say, ‘Let me give you some advice,’ but simply to say, ‘Let me show you who I am.’”

You don’t have to explain yourself. Just tell your story.

One of the reasons she writes a personal essay is to reveal her flaws and failures.

A personal essay captures a small story but not a random story. It was intentionally selected to give us a glimpse of the big questions and challenges in your life.

Focus on narrowing down. Instead of telling everything, tell one story really well.

A personal essay keeps you on track.

Clarify your themes.

Build your story-telling skills.

And then move on to a book or more personal essays.

# What Do You Want to Write About?

Discovering who I am without a man, a plan, a decent job, or money, and having a blast.

- This is a topic that demonstrates rhythm. And rhythm is so important in writing.

You have large themes in life. From there, find the specific stories that support them and that help your readers understand them.

## The elements of your essay

Before you even start writing, decide what your essay is about. Ideally, you should be able to say it in a few words.

- Your topic should be phrased as a particular journey; not a state of being but an experience of change.
- Once you know what the journey is, identify the starting point before the journey began (the context of the journey): life before the change took place.
- What do you want? What is at stake?
- What is standing on your way towards what you want?

Every person who would honestly explore their experience will have a story to tell.
