- The case of prostitution and child labor in Bangladesh
- All human beings experience sadness, but not everyone is diagnosed with depression. In the same sense, all human beings are drawn towards various interests, but not everyone is described to be in a state of multipotentiality. Both are spectrums, and human beings are at different points in that spectrum. Usually, those who are at the far ends of the spectrum get their “labels” because they exhibit the quality so noticeably that psychologists need a term to refer to them.
- Labels are just constructs that are invented for practical reasons. They are necessary myths, much like the “nation-state” is a necessary myth. They may or may not refer to existing phenomena.
- Creative freedom is defined as engaging in creativity whenever one wants and however one wants. It is a spectrum and absolute creative freedom may not be possible but we can do measures that intensifies creative freedom.
- Ginhawa is like equilibrium. The middle ground between extreme sadness and extreme joy. It is the beginning of positive emotions.
   - Yes we need to be stretched which requires us to face negative emotions. But we always need to get back to center. Without going back to center and releasing tension, it is impossible to feel all the other positive emotions that we desire.
- Kaalaman at Karanasan. Sa maghapon, kailangang may balanse sa pagitan ng kaalaman at karanasan. At anumang kaalaman na kakainin ay kailangan pang masala. Ang direktang pagdanas sa mundo ay pakikipagniig sa walang mga bagay na hindi makukuha ng salita
- Pagnilayan ang relasyon ng direkta at di direktang pagdanas ng sining.
- Create a literature note on Pink Sheets
- Create definition notes for each type of note in the Evergreen note-writing system.
- The best way to express oneself is through direct language delivered poetically.
- Why I chose to be an artist
   - According to current research, happiness is genetic and some people are more dispossessed of it than others. I am one of these people. It doesn’t mean that I am destined to a miserable existence. It simply means that I need to give double effort in order to be happy. And that is why I chose to be an artist. Not that most artists are happy (perhaps most are still not). But I thought, art is the closest field to beauty and excellence. And if there is anything closest to happiness, if there’s anything worth living for, it is beauty and excellence.
- Artist vs. artist
   - I want to make a distinction between the artist and the Artist. All of us are artists, which means all of us have to capacity to appreciate beauty and create it.
   - But not all of us make it a Vocation or at least take it seriously. Not everyone becomes an Artist.
   - And it is all about seeing. The artist and the Artist both sees, both have the capacity to see things. But the Artist sees things in an elevated way, he sees beauty where there is none, sees the value of this moment, feels awe and reverence.
   - This is what separates him from everyone who could have been like him.
   - The sam can be told about so-called “spiritual” people. I don’t believe they have something that mortals don’t have. It’s just that they took what all of us have and elevated it to a different level.
   - My voice is melancholic.
      - My voice is melancholic. It is where I am drawn to. Drama. I couldn’t escape it. Comedy need not be in my novels. It has a place but not there. At least not as pronounced.
      - Naglalakad ako rito kung sakin kami dating naglakad ni itay. Sementado na ang daan. Hindi na bako-bako at putikan.
   - How curiosity and love of learning is tensioned in your life. Desire to go deep at something vs desire to explore and be surprised with new knowledge.
   - Research arguments against the context of privilege.
   - “It’s well known in the field of drug abuse research that rats in a cage given access to drugs of various kinds will quickly addict themselves, pressing the little levers for the drug on offer in preference to food, often to the point of death. Much less well known, however, is the fact that if the cage is ‘enriched’ with opportunities for play, interaction with other rats, and exposure to nature, the same rats will utterly ignore the drugs and so never become addicted. The rat park experiments lend support to the idea that the propensity to addiction might have less to do with genes or chemistry than with one’s personal history and environment.” - (from “How to Change Your Mind” by Michael Pollan, p. 372)
   - Review blog posts to extract evergreen notes from them.
   - Doesn’t mean that if a book is not well-written it won’t affect or change your life radically. Some books are not well-written but they are so unique with some of their core message or even just a few sentences that seem to reside just in that book that you will remember it more often even than a well-written book whose pages are packed with wisdom but may not easily be remembered. Don’t judge a book by its contents.
   - How can you have complete autonomy in your creative work while have an audience at the same time? How can this be possible in a world intense in competition? How can you have 1000 true fans in a competitive space?
   - Refusing to fight for something to avoid negative emotions. Is this a stoic way?
   - [[Moral abolitionism]]
   - The feeling that something is special and that we need to do something to show our impression that it is special is where rituals started. And rituals is where religions started. Religions are expressions of fundamental human needs and desires. We can reject organized religion but we cannot dismiss the human impetus that started them.
   - How to live if you are a nihilist
      - If you are a moral nihilist
      - You think that moral claims are just expressions of feelings
      - PROBLEM 1
      - Will you tell yourself to do something you wont tell anybody else.
      - Is this person who has preferences the same person you are commanding to do things.
      - This is something you need to establish.
      - PROBLEM 2
      - How do you live if there are no moral claims.
      - You live based on your preferences.
      - Now your problem will then be to live in a way that you dont contradict your preferences.
      - At least when you use language.
      - But this isnt so big a problem as it is for the moral realist.
- Your inability to let go of your beliefs in light of new and better evidence is a hindrance to your pursuit of truth.
- Anyone who wants to be honest should be ready to let go of his/her own beliefs in light of new and better evidence.
- A piece of information can change status over time or it can have different statuses at the same time
- Sa hilaga may nagpapaputok Lumiliyab ang apoy Tsaka pumuputok Sa timog kumikidlat Lumiliyab ang dagitab Tahimik lang
- Kalsada Ilang sasakyan pa Ang kailangan natin Upang makararing tayo Saan man tayo tutungo?
- Ang pag-ibig Ay ang pagaantay Sa napakaikling sandaling Makatatawid ka Sa isang bising-bising Kalsada
- Let things be or intervene
   - This summarizes all the decisions we do in life both at the individual and the societal levels
   - This is related to action or inaction
   - When is the best times to let things be? When is th best time to intervene? Is it always better to let things be?
- Upang maging haciendero
Kailngan mo lang tumayo
Sa harap ng malawak na lupain
At antayin ang matandang nakabisikleta
Na tumugil at tanungin ka,
“Pinapapatubigan niyo ba ito?”

- Anarchizing thinking
- In developing countries where the distinction between the rich and the poor is pronounced, leftists call almost every "good" experience as elitist.

Not everything you want (goal) is valuable to you (value).

A goal is something you have to be able to visualize. It is an end state. A value can only be visualized if it is a goal.

There are lots of things you can value. One of these are your goals. But these are by no means the only things you value.
