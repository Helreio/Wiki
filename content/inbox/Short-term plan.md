# Short-term plan

In order to live a beautiful life, you need to be aware of the finiteness of time. You need to recognize your mortality. Knowing this, you want to spend most of your time on things that really matter. You need to learn to prioritize.

Priority: to feel good

Health: mental, physical, social

That's the focus

Nothing grand

Grieve the relationship

Tackle depression

- Taper meds
- CBT
- Other approaches

Relationships, communities

Plan an economic strategy

Build a worldview

Create something

Learn something

Play something

Start an adventure
