# Flea infestation project

Fleas

- Feed on blood
- Active indoor during cold weather
- Transported through soles of shoes
- Nest in carpets and pet beds
- Can jump up to 8 inches, but can’t fly
- Without access to blood, they live only a few days
- If fleas have access to blood, they can live for as long as 100 days
- If they live that long, they can lay eggs, making a flea infestation
- Flea pupae nest in cocoons where they can wait for extended period of time
- Fleas detect carbon dioxide, warmth, and movement
- Fleas can lurk in homes even without pets

Fleabite

- very itchy
- small red bumps that hurt
- clusters
- dark red dot at the center
- surrounded b area of inflamed skin
- itch for 1-2 days
- bites can swell up to 2 weeks

**For me**

Wear long pants tucked into socks.

Avoid

- Skintight, thin fabrics (socks and tights)
- Loose weaves (crocheted sweaters)

Spray flea repellent onto clothing or skin.

- Permethrin
- DDET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide)
- Thyme oil or myrtle oil
   - Add 5 drops to 1 cup of carrier oil

Avoid scratching fleabites

Use an antibacterial cleanser

**For cats**

Try topical medications

Try oral medications with prescriptions

Flea collars

- Buy based on pet’s weight

Bathe them regularly

Daily flea combing

- Dip the comb in warm soapy water between strokes to drown the fleas
- Groom your pet outside

Synthesis

- Your main goal is to not have them access to blood, which means to keep them off yourself and your pets.

To do

- Buy topical anti-itch cream
- Buy new bed sheets (at least two)
- Buy flea powder
- Wash the carpet with soap
- Buy a flea comb
