[[thoughts/living]] is the most important [[thoughts/action]] among the [[Five areas of my life work]]. It is the most important part of what I have to do overall. The quality of the other categories of action and my creative work in general is affected by the quality of how I live.

Living is the ultimate battleground where everything I learn from [[thoughts/understanding]] converge. I do the other categories of action to live a good life in the first place. Therefore, it is necessary to have a [[Hierarchy of categories of actions in my work]].

Thinking about, optimizing, and acting to improve [[My life areas]] of my life is part of the work, if not the most important work. Also, [[Living can be part of the creative work]]. [[The art of living is my gift]].
