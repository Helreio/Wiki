The Financial Integrity Program allows you to get beyond money concerns and get on with LIFE.

2. Rethink it.
3. Build a new relationship that truly fits your life.

Give equal weight to ALL the steps in their appropriate order.

**Step 1**

**Lifetime Income Estimate + Personal Balance Sheet**

Calculate your lifetime income estimate and create a personal balance sheet

**Step 2**

**Real Hourly Wage + Daily Expenses Log**

Calculate your real hourly wage - the current monetary value of your time and energy. Become aware of all your financial transactions and their real cost.

**Step 3**

**Monthly Tabulation**

Keep a monthly record of your spending patterns and how they affect your bottom line.

**Step 4**

**Three Questions**

Evaluate your spending based on your own satisfaction, values, and goals.

**Step 5**

**Wall Chart**

Track your progress monthly in order to stay motivated for long-term goals

**Step 6**

**Minimizing Spending**

Naturally reduce expenses by applying a new approach to spending that reflects maximum fulfilment for your life as a whole.

**Step 7**

**Maximizing Income**

Naturally increase income, in alignment with your health and integrity, by recognizing your time as a precious, limited resource.

**Step 8**

**Capital + Cross-Over Point**

Set a goal - “enough and then some.” Invest your savings to receive income regardless of employment status and estimate the time of financial independence.

**Step 9**

**Managing Investments + Financial Independence**

Take personal responsibility for your future and become knowledgeable, sophisticated, and adept about investment vehicles within your own self-defined criteria.

Question your assumptions around money.

Question your culture’s messages about money.

Investigate what is really true for YOU.

**The Fulfillment Curve**

We usually spend money trying to make our lives better or happier in some way.

*Survival*

- Fulfillment comes from outside of us.
- Money = Fulfillment
- On the level of basic necessities, a little money can bring a LOT of satisfaction.

*Comforts*

- Buying necessities -> Buying comforts = Definition of success shifts.
- More Money = More Fulfillment

*Luxuries*

- Believe on money = fulfillment is so firm.
- The fulfillment no longer lasts
- Fulfillment is nor nearly proportional to the amount of money spent.

*Clutter*

- Hit fulfillment ceiling.
- Money = Fulfillment has started to work against us.
- Spending money doesn’t bring fulfillment anymore; it just brings a sense of burden or futility.

**Recognizing Enough**

Law of Diminishing Returns means that money = fulfillment will not work anymore.

The Peak of the Fulfillment Curve

- Point of maximum fulfillment
- Key to happiness
- Key to healthy relationship with money
- Identify your Peak, your Enough

How do we know if we have enough?

- We have everything we need, but nothing in excess.
- We have enough for our survival.
- We have enough for our comforts.
- We have a few luxuries.
- We feel satisfied.
- There’s nothing in excess to burden us or complicate our lives.
- Feeling pleasantly “full” of money without that constant yearning for more.

It takes certain skills and qualities:

- To reach enough.
- To recognize when you’ve reached enough.
- To stay near that peak of the Fulfillment Curve, without falling back into deprivation or down into gluttony.

**Date: 6 April 2016 (Wednesday)**

**How would you rate your current relationship with money?**

Bad (clouded with persistent feelings of fear, worry, deprivation, hopelessness; no matter how much time devoted to acquiring and managing it, it’s never enough)

**What are your current feelings about money?**

- When I spend money on my meds I feel like I hope I don’t have depression and that I can use this money for other things.
- When I spend money on internet I feel like it’s too expensive and yet I need an internet connection to feel functional and connected every day.
- When I spend money on travel I feel good and integral because I’m doing something I know I love, however, I also fear that I’m spending too much and that I don’t have enough capacity to replenish my funds. I also tend to feel bad when the trip doesn’t turn out as good as expected. This is because I have very limited funds and I feel like my money just went to nothing.
- When I spend money on food dates with friends I feel good because I get to connect with people plus when I pay the bill, I can show how much I value them. I also don’t get frustrated about my time and money going to nothing because the time spent talking with friends is always good for me.
- When I spend money for family, I feel I’m giving back to all the hard work they’ve done for me. Plus I’m not paying them anything for my food. It’s a way to show my appreciation and love even for just one dinner per month.
- When I spend money on street foods I feel guilty because I’m not living according to my belief on health (happily, I’m slowly getting over this habit).

# Step 5 - Wall Chart

Vertical Axis = Money

Horizontal Axis = Time

Optional: Add savings or debt

Make your chart visible

Change is difficult and no one is perfect. You will have “good” months and “bad” months.

Use those times to remind yourself of your purpose for doing this and your goals.

# Step 7 - Maximize Income

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056859,120.453699)

**Goal**

Exchange the life energy you put into your job for the highest possible income, without compromising your values or your health, for a self-defined period of time.

**Estimate the hours you may have left in your life**

51 years x 8766 hours per year = 447,066 hours

**Estimate the hours you may have left “on the job” until you expect to “retire"**

20 hours_week x 52 weeks_year x 41 years = 42,640 hours

**What is your evaluation of your current real hourly wage in relation to your income goals for that length of time?**

Not “enough"

**What is your evaluation of the current level of effort you’re putting into your job?**

It’s a job - I just do what I have to do

---

The only purpose of paid employment is to get paid.

---

Create options for yourself so that you do not HAVE to work for any longer than is needed to reach “enough."

Parts:

1. Move towards the highest possible income.
2. Consistent with your integrity and health.
3. For a self-defined period of time.

---

**Part 1: Move towards the highest possible income.**

Maximum income means earning top dollar for your time.

This involves:

- Putting to effort into your employment and demanding pay equal to that effort.
- Reducing job-related expenses.

Hours left in life = 447,066 hours

Time is a finite commodity

Maximize the benefit from any time you expend.

How could you earn more money in your current job, while remaining in alignment with your integrity and your health? Could you move up a level or take on extra work?

---

**Part 2: Consistent with your health and integrity**

Compromising your health or your values, even for a short period of time, is detrimental to achieving your goals for Financial Integrity. The means are as important as the ends.

---

**Part 3: For a self-defined period of time**

Define the time when you will stop working then work towards it.

You define how long you pursue paid employment, based on criteria of maximum fulfillment rather than government or corporate policy.
