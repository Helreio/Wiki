**Favor a low-impact solution to a flea infestation**

The best way to tackle a flea infestation is to interrupt the flea life cycle without compromising the safety of humans and pets living in the area.

To do this, opt for low-impact approaches like regular vacuuming and laundering along with pet bathing and grooming before exploring pesticides. If the situation starts to require pesticides, then opt for those with low toxicity.

**Optimal environment for fleas**

**The flea life cycle**

An adult female takes at least one meal then it starts laying 25-50 eggs a day.

Flea eggs look like salt.

Flea feces look like pepper.

Eggs hatch into larvae in two days to a few weeks.

Larvae feed on dried blood, flea feces, pet fecal debris.

In five days to one month, the larvae becomes a cocoon.

The cocoon lasts from five days to a year.

The cocoon is stimulated by vibrations and emerge as an adult, which then jumps to its host.

The life cycle of fleas is within 18 to 28 days. You have to implement a treatment plan within that life cycle.
