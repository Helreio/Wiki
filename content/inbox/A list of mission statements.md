# A list of mission statements

I explore the question how should I live? I am interested in answers that are both beautiful and true. Beautiful, meaning they inspire peace, beauty, and everything that feels good. True, meaning they are based on careful and honest thought.

Build your own worldview.

Never outsource your thinking.

A more beautiful world based on truth is possible.

I believe that each of us can better our lives by understanding our place in the cosmos, and this is a project too important to outsource to anyone.

I study insights about the art of living from philosophy, psychology, religion, and other disciplines.

I apply the things I learn in my life and share what did or didnâ€™t work.

I am doing this with the knowledge that there is no one way to live a good life. There are as many ways to do it as people. But there are commonalities among human experiences and we can learn a lot by studying the lives of others. From ancient philosophy to modern psychological science. That said, this blog is a deeply personal project, and if there is any real good it can benefit others, it is to inspire them to deepen their own understanding of themselves and the world.

A rational practice of the good life

I want all the good things outlined in Beyond Morality. But I want to achieve them truthfully.
