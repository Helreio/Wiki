About Vince Imbat

Hi there. I’m Vincent Imbat and this website is the home of my life’s work. I write about the pursuit of a good life through the interconnections of science, spirituality, and social change in the context of Filipino culture.

The central question I try to answer in my work is: How can we live a better life? In order to answer that question, I study a wide variety of fields - science, philosophy, art, and literature - and employ different methods of knowing to uncover specific ways in which we can be better in the things that really matter. I then apply the knowledge I learn in my everyday life to test it and then report my personal findings in this blog in a way that translates complex ideas into easily digestible chunks of lessons.

The primary place I share this information is through my newsletter. You can sign up below. I don’t have all the answers and I myself am also a work in progress, but I’m happy to share what I’ve learned along the way.

Paghilom: My Personal Journey To Heal

More than a depository of useful articles, this blog is also a chronicle of my own personal journey to healing and flourishing.

In my past life, I was groomed as a young pastor. But a tragedy came to me in March 2011 which completely changed my life. At age 19, I was diagnosed with severe depression which later on evolved into dysthymia, a less severe but chronic and persistent form of depression, which forced me to stop schooling. It was a very painful experience, one that made me leave my former religion, loose faith in God, and reject all kinds of spirituality.

Along the way, I lost most of my friends, but most devastatingly, I lost meaning and purpose in life.

But, I decided to live again.

A year later, I went back to school, finished my degree, and helped a community people with disabilities organize themselves. After graduation I deviated from conventional work and started writing for purpose-driven brands and editing academic works and books. I purposefully chose this path so I can have enough time to recover and take good care of my mind and body. I embraced a creative and multifaceted life grounded in my desire for freedom, vibrance, and contribution.

Slowly, I began to feel a sense of purpose and connection to the world around me again. And as I learned meditation and yoga, the "spiritual" in me returned. I realized that spirituality is far deeper than my earlier ideas about organized religion. Spirituality stays there within our deepest selves forever.

For me, spirituality is simply how I live my life in accordance to how I perceive the reality behind our Universe.

Everyone sees the Universe in a different way. Everyone has his own kind of spirituality.

We are free to choose what we believe in and how we live our lives according to that belief.

From all the lessons I learned during and after the things I went through, I have come to believe that the world - including us and the material universe - is more connected than we care to realize. Therefore, to aspire to live a better life means to contribute to the healing of an undeniably ailing world. And that healing, that social change, begins within the self.

This site chronicles my rebirth, my personal renaissance, my journey towards living the lessons I learned from study and experience.

What I read and write about in this blog is almost always what I also need at that particular moment. I try my best to “walk the talk” and implement the things I find from my own personal journey then share the results in this blog.

From my recent personal experiments, I have found out that a combination of communion with nature, regular travel, enriching conversations with people, exposure and creative affairs with art, plus a deep pursuit for meaning and spirituality in one's own life, all contribute towards a healthier, richer, deeper existence.

If anything within my story resonates with you, then the words you’ll find in this blog may help shed light in your own journey.
