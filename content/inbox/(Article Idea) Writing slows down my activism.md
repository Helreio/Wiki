Title: Writing slows down my activism

Writing slows down my activism

It teaches me that change is not anthropocentric

Change happens with the help of animals, plants, the natural world

Because we are all connected

So sometimes we want change to be fast

And in some cases we really have to be immediate in our approach

But to create a rule that says all kinds of activism needs to be fast, forceful - that i think is not too realistic

So our activism also needs to be slow

We have to be open to other forms of activism

Slow activism makes activism more democratic

More people will be able to engage in it

I helped organized a deaf community

I was briefly involved in people with mental illness

Disability slows down someone

To say that activism needs to be agit means that some pwds some people will be ignored

Activism is the craft

Writing is the tool

How can introverts be activists?

“If we want our world to be beautiful, just, and kind, then our activism should be beautiful, just, and kind.”
