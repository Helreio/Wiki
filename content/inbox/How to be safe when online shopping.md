# How to be safe when online shopping

[[Nicole Alba]] has an excellent advice to be safe when online shopping:

1. Use e-wallets when you shop online. If your card is compromised, the only thing they'll get access to is the limited money there. The e-wallets I consistently use are Shopee Pay, GCash, and my FastPlus CIMB account.
2. Keep your e-wallets empty (or with very little money). Only load them when you need to use them online.
