# Fitz Villafuerte’s budgeting strategy

The following steps are [[Fitz Villafuerte]]'s budgeting strategy:

1. List all income received last month.
2. List all expected needs or necessary expenses for the coming month.
3. Income - 30% Savings = Available Budget (Note: Savings = Cash + Investment Fund).
4. Available Budget - Needs = Wants (Option: Instead of spending all of what’s left on Wants, just add money to Savings)

Scenario 1: If Available Budget < Needs then lower Savings rate (Assumption: Needs are all necessary expenses)

Scenario 2: If Available Budget < Needs and Savings Rate = 0 then create extra Income (Note: Ignore this scenario and you will end up in a lot of debt)

I won’t necessarily follow this process since I am still trying to apply [[Your Money or Your Life]]. But I'll kep this on hand if things change in the future.
