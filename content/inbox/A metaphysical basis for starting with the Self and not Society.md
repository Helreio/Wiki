# A metaphysical basis for starting with the Self and not Society

1. Your Self is the only sure thing that you know exists.
2. The existence of other minds - other selves - is something you are not "more sure of" than the existence of your Self.
3. Society is not your Self. It is supposed to be a collection of selves.
4. To begin change on that which you are not sure exists before thay which you are sure exists is a "less sound strategy" than beginning change on something which you know exists.
5. Even if the othet minds really exists, you don not control their agency.
6. The other mind is subjective - its experience is unique to the other person.
