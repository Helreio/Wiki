# We disagree because we don't have direct access on the minds of others. I think that's where disagreements ultimately originate. The only way we could have direct access to someone else's mind is whenÂ we are that person.

We disagree because we don't have direct access on the minds of others. I think that's where disagreements ultimately originate. The only way we could have direct access to someone else's mind is when we are that person.

This is why we are able to say something like, "It's difficult for me to explain to you because you didn't go through what i went through."

And this is exactly right. Our experiences are unique to us - to our perspective and to the time and space where our experiences happen. Even if someone else went through a similar experience, that experience is entirely unique on its own - it is never the same - because events happened in a different body and in a different time. Those make experiences unique. No one experience ever happens again.

We can't escape the following conclusion: each of us is unique in this fundamental way. No one else can have our thoughts and experiences.

When we transmit these unique thoughts and experiences, we are only able to do so through the tools of language - sounds, words, and their meanings.

We cannot directly transmit our thoughts, our reasonings and our experiences. What we are able to do is to piece together different tools of language - most of which arise from convention - and trust that the person we are talking to create a mind picture that is an aproximation to what we are trying to say. We do not have absolute control of this process - the other person may or may not understand, and if we are trying to make an argument about something, the other person may completely disagree.

This is just the fact of life and we will be on a better position if we accept this and not be bothered a lot when communication fails.

I am someone who has lots of ideas about the world and I have friends who are the same. But we read different books, we follow different people, and we were raised in different ways. When I have deep conversations about the world with them, we reach a lot of points when I fail to understand what they are trying to say or I disagree on their point of view completely. This happens both ways and there were times when the I felt like an agreement won't be reached. This happens more often than not and for me, this is testament to the uniqueness of each and everyone, which I sincerely believe.

Such scenarios do not just happen in intellectual conversations, they happen within the family and out there in public life. When a family member refuses to talk for fear that her perspective would be misunderstood or when politicians bicker at each other in national TV, this fact of life is in full display.

I find that there are two attitudes in addressing situations of disagreements: (1) we attack the person behind the conflicting opinion or (2) we accept the disagreement and continue to coexist and even care for the other person. When I saw Walden Bello go at it with a representative of Anakbayan, I saw two people representing two sides who chose to act according to the first attitude I mentioned.

When I learned about how an activist used handcraft to communicate with a politician in the other side of an issue, I saw the second attitude.

I don't want to label either of the two approaches as good or bad. I want to objectively judge which of the two approaches give us the result that we are looking for.

For me, a world where disagreements happen more than agreements, I think peaceful nonviolent coexistence is ultimately more favorable. It accepts the fact of life and goes with it rather than use force.
