# Ginhawa while thinking might be more important than meditation

Did Buddha reject all kinds of reasoning? Did he simply say stop thinking, meditate and you will be released of suffering?

As an ordinary human being, this is what happens for the majority of us when we start introducing meditation into our lives: Most of us will start with a five-minute practice or even less. Then the majority of our time will be spent on dealing with the necessities of life, which involves a lot of thinking.

This five-minute practice will increase after time but will never exceed 1 hour a day let a lone 30 minutes for most of us. And even a bigger majority of us will never even practice meditation. Now given that even meditators will spend most of their time using their reasoning, a practice to feel Ginhawa using reasoning is perhaps even more important than meditation.

[[thoughts/meditation]] helps cultivate more presence and the ability to pause, accept, and let go. It is like fertilizer to a soil that can become more reasonable and insightful. But being in a continuous meditative state of mindâ€”that is reserved to the few superhumans who can even afford to do so. For the most of us, reason is a better therapy (see [[Stoicism]], [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]], [[Thinking can generate Ginhawa too]]).
