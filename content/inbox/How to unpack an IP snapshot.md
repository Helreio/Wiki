# How to unpack an IP snapshot

In their book [[The Thought Leaders Practice]], [[Matt Church]] and [[Peter Cook]] adviced the following method to unpack an IP snapshot.

General principles:

- Adapt your delivery depending upon your experience and that of your audience.
- Start by delivering at a contextual level before going into the detail of what you are trying to communicate.
- Give people a visual map to follow (model) or a specific context for them to be thinking around (metaphor).
- [[Present your ideas using logic then emotions]].
