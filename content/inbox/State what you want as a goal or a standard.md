# State what you want as a goal or a standard

Stating what you want is important in [[goal-setting]]. A [[Goal]] is simply a statement of what you want, an [[End state]] you desire.

There are two ways to express what you want:

1. State it as a one-time goal achievable through a [[Project]].
2. State it as a continuous [[Standard]] of an [[thoughts/life area]] that is maintained through [[Habit]] and [[Routines]].

While [[thoughts/tiago forte]] argues that standards cannot be articulated, only felt, I believe that [[An area's standard can be articulated]] simply because it is a recurring end state.
