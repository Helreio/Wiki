# I have made peace with debates. I think they're ok and necessary. I have learned that the search for truth is not without pain. If we care for truth, we have to be honest enough to accept that we have to confront its opposite.

What I prefer not to have is violent communication, communication that is foul and unnecessary, beyond just discomfort, it is intentionally uttered to create or inspire physical violence.
