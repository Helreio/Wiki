# Imannuel Kant’s strolls

Kant’s walks were mostly brief and not very well thought of. But he walked whatever the weather was. He always walked by himself because he believed he shouldn’t be talking. A closed mouth was good for his body.

He walked the same path every day, which was later called “The Philosopher’s Walk.” He only left this route twice: (1) to get an early copy of Rousseau’s Emile and (2) to get news about the French Revolution.

After his walk, he read until 10:00 pm, then sleeps.

Unlike [[thoughts/friedrich nietzsche]], who used walks as the platform for philosophizing, or [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]], who communed with Nature, Kant's daily one-hour walk was whimsical and unsystematic. It was just a "hygienic necessity” that wasn't even necessarily pleasurable. Kant's walks were strolls ([[Walking as a relieving stroll]]) that were used not as a method, but an open-ended experience.

Kant’s walks highlight three characteristics of walking:

1. Walking's monotony liberates the mind. The monotony of walking means that the body has something to do, which frees the mind from the need to look for something to do and allows it to let thoughts to arise.
2. Walking develops discipline.
3. Walking allows one to master inevitability. When one starts to walk, one is forced to arrive.

But he looked after himself during his daily walk which was always very brief, a bit perfunctory.
