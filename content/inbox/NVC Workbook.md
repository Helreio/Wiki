# NVC Workbook

**1 - Exercises for the Chapter: Giving from the Heart**

**One - Individual Assignments**

**Reading Review**

*1. The author, Marshall B. Rosenberg, says that NVC evolved out of his exploration of two questions that had occupied him since childhood. These two questions are:*

- What happens to disconnect us from our compassionate nature, leading us to behave violently and exploitatively?
- What allows some people to stay connected to their compassionate nature under even the most trying circumstances?

*2. “Nonviolent Communication” is also known by the title, “*________*,” “NVC,” or in some countries, “Giraffe Language.” Some people have expressed discomfort with the word “nonviolent” in the title because they don’t perceive themselves engaging in “violent” speech. How does Marshall explain the use of the word “nonviolent” in “Nonviolent Communication?” (Please note: when used in this context, “nonviolent” is one word, without a hyphen.)*

Compassionate Communication

Marshall took the word “nonviolent" from the term “nonviolence” as used by Ghandi. Nonviolence refers to our natural state of compassion when violence has subsided from the heart. Even if we don’t consider the way we talk to be “violent,” the words we utter usually lead to hurt and pain for other and for ourselves.

*3. What is the purpose of NVC?*

The purpose of NVC is to strengthen our ability to remain human even under trying conditions through language and communication skills. It is a way of communicating that leads us to give from the heart, connecting us with ourselves and with each other in a way that allows our natural compassion to flourish.

*4. How does it differ from the way we often communicate?*

Often, our words are simply habitual, automatic, and almost unconscious reactions to situations. Through NVC, our words become conscious responses based firmly on awareness of what we are perceiving, feeling, and wanting.

Often, our communication patterns involve defending, withdrawing, or attacking in the face of judgement and criticism. Through NVC, resistance, defensiveness, and violent reactions are minimized.

In NVC, we focus on clarifying what is being observed, felt, and needed rather than on diagnosing and judging. It emphasizes deep listening to ourselves and to others it reminds us to keep our attention focused on a place where we are more likely to get what we are seeking.

*5. What is Marshall referring to when he writes that NVC is “more than a process or a language?"*

NVC is more than a language because it is possible to experience it without uttering a single word. The essence of NVC is in our consciousness of its four components and not in the actual words being exchanged. It is also more than a process because it is not a set formula. It can adapt to various situations as well as personal and cultural styles.

- Expressing honestly through the four components.
- Receiving empathically through the four components.
