## Become Happier by Learning & Applying Psychological Science

There is a science of happiness and a practice of happiness. Knowing about the things that could make you happy is not enough. You have to apply this knowledge to be happy.

Course Title: The Science of Well-being: What Psychological Science Says About the Good Life

Lectures

- Misconceptions About Happiness
- Why Our Expectations Are So Bad
- What Stuff Really Increases Happiness
- Strategies to Reset Our Expectations
- Putting Strategies Into Practice

## Why This Course Exists

1. The science of psychology has lots of new insights.
   1. Policymakers realize this and are looking to apply these insights.
2. We need these insights pretty badly.
   1. Recent graduates are more prone at being unhappy.
3. I need these insights really badly too.

## What is the G.I. Joe Fallacy?

The mistaken idea that “knowing” is half the battle.

Merely knowing something is not enough to put it into practice and change your behavior.

Vision as a metaphor

Even if we know that optical illusions are wrong, we still can’t stop our eyes (our brain in fact) from falling for them.

If we really want to change our behavior, we need to change our habits.

Increasing your own well-being takes daily, intentional effort over long periods of time.
