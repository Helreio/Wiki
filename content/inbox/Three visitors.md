# Three visitors

In the dimming light of the sun, the three visitors came.

The social self came when passers by came.

The essential self came when I stood there looking at the sun while the next passer by looked at me and I didn't care.

Then my true self showed up when I just stood there breathing looking at the sun setting in the horizon.

The true self is what's metaphysically existing.

The essential and social selves only concepts I use everyday to go about life.
