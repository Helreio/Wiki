# What is information? Closer to truth

What if information is more fudamental than matter, energy, space?

How does matter and information fit together? Do they follow different laws?

Information seems always attached to something.

What if information is the primary stuff on which the physical world is built?

Living organisms are information processing systems.

Information is processed in computers, which are designed.

Living organisms were not designed. They evolved. So how can randomness produce something that would make information emerge?

There are two levels of description

- Informational
- Material

How did information emerged from matter?

Quantum physics seems to prove that information is more fundamental than matter. You interogate universe and it answers bits and pieces and it gives you a code
