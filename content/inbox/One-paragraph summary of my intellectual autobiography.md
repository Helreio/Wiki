# One-paragraph summary of my intellectual autobiography

My life as a young pastor for the Jehovah’s Witnesses took a turn after a depressive episode in 2011. Unable to keep my personal beliefs in tact after going through unbearable suffering, I left my childhood religion in 2012 leaving a void that needs to be filled. Understanding that my life was meaningless unless I put meaning into it, I started exploring alternative philosophies like atheism, humanism, and socialism. While these philosophies opened my eyes to a completely different world from what I was raised into, these philosophies failed to help me appreciate the “inner life” which I have grown into since childhood and which my depression pointed me into. Realizing that my thirst for personal renewal was not gone, despite leaving my childhood faith, I started exploring Eastern philosophy and this concept called “spirituality.” While my exploration of Eastern philosophy enhanced my personal experiences, a lot of the teachings and beliefs embedded in these philosophies came into conflict with my rational side. A book by a rogue philosopher made me question the beliefs I was soaking myself into. This reflection lead me to a quest to create my personal philosophy of living grounded on logic and reason but made alive through the experiential ethos of Eastern philosophy and the indigenous Filipino concept called “Ginhawa.”
