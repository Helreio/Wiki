# How Asian Efficiency founder Thanh Pham organizes his Second Brain

Digital notes are like pieces of legos you put together to support and build your projects.

**WHAT (What is worth saving)**

Whatever you keep, be intentional.

Be selective.

Don’t create more work for your future self by hoarding notes.

Criteria for what to keep

1. Inspiring - Is this something that could inspire me if it surfaced at some point in the future?
2. Useful - Is this potentially a useful source, building block, or tool for future projects?
3. Easily lost - Is this something that I’m unlikely to find in the future?
4. Personal - Is this unique, personal, or hard-won knowledge worth revisiting over the years?

Stuff that defies categorization (you can’t put it in a physical context because it isn’t too utilitarian, example, a poem) is something you should keep in your second brain.

Don’t save something Googleable.

14 types of digital notes

1. Marketing assets
2. Mementos
3. Reference/record-keeping
4. New content
5. Repurposed content
6. Favorites
7. Call/meeting notes
8. Contributions of others
9. Language to borrow
10. Helpful models
11. Placeholders
12. Research/inspiration
13. Planning/reorganization
14. Preparation/agenda

Fundamental difference between paper and digital notes

- Capturing
- Identifying
- Titling
- Citing
- Searching
- Linking
- Indexing
- Moving
- Sharing

These meta-work is automated by digital notes. You save time to actually creating value.

**HOW (How to we save notes)**

eBook (Kindle highlight then send to Evernote)

Online articles (read-it-later app like Instapaper)

Webpage highlights (web highlighter like Liner)

PDF (PDF Expert, highlight then share to Evernote)

Your Second Brain is not one app. It’s a constellation or toolkit of apps that is in constant evolution.

**WHY (Why do we do this)**

We have more than an information overload. We have an information exhaustion.

Average information consumption per day (from UC San Diego, 2014)

- 174 newspapers’ worth
- 11.8 hours
- 113k+ words
- \+2.6% per year

FOMI

- fear of missing information
- gets us stuck to feeds

If everything around you is designed to hook you, take the mindset of a curator.

- Public -> Private
- Novel -> Timeless
- Sensational -> Subtle
- Consuming -> Digesting

You want to be part of the internet - the greatest creative event - but you need to do that more intentionally by using a buffer to take things slowly.

Information is food.

- You are the information you consume.
- You need information, but you need to improve your information diet.

Second brain is the OCD part.

Your first brain becomes more creative.

Thanh Pham

Uses Siri a lot. Narrating his notes.

Reviews weekly to organize them.

Tiago

Choose mostly mainstream apps that won’t disappear.

Memorizing is a waste of time.

You shoudn’t optimize your first brain.

The first brain is for creativity, art, joy, rest, etc.

How to filter information

- Do not filter at the source.
- In the moment, it is difficult to decide what is worth consuming. Use read later apps. Then go through read later apps later and identify which is worth consuming.
