# One-paragraph outline of my intellectual autobiography

**Act 1: The story of my life as a JW**

Disaster 1: Depression (natural)

**Act 2: The story of my attempts to keep everything (mostly my beliefs) in tact after the depression**

Disaster 2: Leaving the JWs (result of trying to fix things)

**Act 3: My first attempts to search for a new philosophy of living in atheism, humanism, and socialism**

Disaster 3: The philosophies and way of life I chose to try out neglects the “inner life” that I have cultivated during my years as a JW and which was calling me during my depression

**Act 4: My exposure to Eastern philosophy, “spirituality”**

Disaster 4: My awakening to the irrationality of the beliefs I am soaking myself into

Ending: I decide to create a philosophy of my own grounded on logic and reason but expanded through experiential knowledge inherent in Eastern philosophy and indigenous Filipino knowledge of Ginhawa
