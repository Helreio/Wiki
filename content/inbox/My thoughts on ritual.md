# My thoughts on ritual

Ritual is universal. Its main purpose is to put more intentionality in things, spaces, and activities. It is an expression of belief. However, it can be used by those like me who disbelieve. An intentional life is a big ritual.

However, rituals can go to far and I think the extreme ones make me uncomfortable. I don’t think I’ll be uncomfortable though if I was observing a ritual in its indigenous or natural context.

There is another way of thinking about this. According to [[Alain de Botton]], even atheists and agnostics could participate in rituals that are originally from religious or spiritual traditions.

Participation is immersion in the worldview of others. I think part of my problem is that I feel like I am constantly immersed in the worldview of my friends, but they do not get that immersed in mine.

To resolve this, I need to speak my truth whenever there is a space or opportunity to do so, like sharings after a ritual. I need to reveal my doubts and my real perspective. This way I can still participate without feeling that much bothered about it.
