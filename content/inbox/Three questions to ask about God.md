# Three questions to ask about God

To believe in a God or a spirit is perfectly fine. In fact, many philosophers have committed on these beliefs. The only difference between them and most people is that before they committed, they first asked the following questions:

1. Is there really a God or spirit?
2. If yes or now, how do I know?
3. What does the existence or non-existence of God or spirit mean to me?
