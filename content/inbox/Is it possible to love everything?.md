# Is it possible to love everything?

Yes. If something, an idea, a concept, a group has existed - you allow it to exist if it has laid claim on its boundaries. You look for somewhere else to go. And only defend yourself if needed.

But you love it by never breaking the rule of self-determination and freedom.
