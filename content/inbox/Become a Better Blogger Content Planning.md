# *Content Pillars*

Source Inspiration

- The best bloggers go out and find inspiration

Content Pillars

- Hold up your content.
- Topics that you are going to write about in a regular basis.
- A topic you can write 10 blog posts about or an ebook you can publish one day.
- Topics you can continuously refer back to.

How to do this?

1. Topical
2. 3 E’s

Topical

1. Go back to your audience
2. Think about different things they may want to think about
3. Tips
4. Stories about interesting people (summarising a biography, talking to people individually)
5. Industry news

3 E’s (Content Types)

1. Engagement - start a conversation (personal beliefs about something)
2. Evergreen - powerful, refer back to at a regular basis, it doesn’t matter what time of the year you publish it it will be relevant
3. Events

Think about 3 different areas you want to talk regularly on your blog.

# *Brand Journalism*

Write more like a journalist than a marketer.

- A marketer is salesy, more about the company that a conversation.
- You want to start and get the conversation going rather than get people to take an action.

How?

- Storytelling
- Interview
- Research (Footnotes)
- Thought Leadership (establish yourself in the long-term)
- Critical Thinking
- Observation (who, what, when, why, and how)

Exercise

1. Think about a topic in your blog.
2. Write it in a traditional sales approach (convince people of your ideas).
3. Rewrite using storytelling, interview, research, thought leadership, and critical thinking.
4. Compare the two.
5. Look at where your style fits in the spectrum.
