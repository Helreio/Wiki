# The Four Educative Drives | Alliance for Self-Directed Education

9 Highlights from The Four Educative Drives | Alliance for Self-Directed Education

---

Children, by nature, are intensely curious, playful, and sociable

---

A fourth drive, which we might call call planfulness — the drive to think about and make plans for the future — emerges and strengthens as children grow older. It is reasonable to refer to these drives as the educative drives.

---

While curiosity motivates children to seek new knowledge and understanding, playfulness motivates them to practice new skills and use those skills creatively.

---

They play to have fun, not deliberately to educate themselves, but education is the side effect for which the strong drive to play came about in the course of evolution. They play at the full range of skills that are crucial to their long-term survival and wellbeing.

---

Play is not recess from education; it IS education. Children learn far more in play, and with far more joy, than they could possibly learn in a classroom.

---

As the philosopher Daniel Dennett put it in a chapter on language and intelligence, “Comparing our brains with bird brains or dolphin brains is almost beside the point, because our brains are in effect joined together into a single cognitive system that dwarfs all others. They are joined by an innovation that has invaded our brain and no others: language.”

---

Cognitive scientists refer to this capacity to make plans and carry them out as self-directed executive functioning

---

children who have ample free time to play and explore on their own and with other children, independent of adults, develop this capacity more fully than do children who spend more time in adult-structured activities.

---

When children create their own activities, without adult control, they are continuously practicing the ability to make plans and carry them out. They make mistakes, but they learn from those mistakes.
