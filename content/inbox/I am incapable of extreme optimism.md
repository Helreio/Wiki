# I am incapable of extreme optimism

I know that there are more good happening in the world than bad but we donâ€™t see it because we have a psychological bias towards the negative. But I look at the people around me and realize how stuck we are in the status quo that it is difficult for me to visualize that this current state of things could crumble down.
