# Getting Things Done + Personal Knowledge Management: AN INTEGRATED TOTAL LIFE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

although these materials are “seldom associated with urgency, nor are they strategic…”, if left unmanaged “your mental and physical workspaces become cluttered with non-actionable but potentially relevant and useful stuff.” This lack of effective downstream systems, he claims, eventually produces a “debilitating psychological noise” that makes any kind of creative thinking impossible. We’ve all been there.
