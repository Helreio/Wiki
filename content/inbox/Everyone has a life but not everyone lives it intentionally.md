# Everyone has a life but not everyone lives it intentionally

Everyone alive is living. Everyone living has wants, ways of getting what they want, and possibly ways of reflecting about how they pursued their wants. However, [[thoughts/intentional living]] is putting consciousness into the entire equation.

It involves more careful reflection on what one wants, openness to the best way to get what one wants, and deeper and more regular reviews and reflection on oneâ€™s actions.

In a very related manner, [[Everyone has a life system but not everyone designs it intentionally]].
