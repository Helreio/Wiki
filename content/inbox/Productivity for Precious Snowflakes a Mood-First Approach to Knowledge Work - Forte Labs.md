Internal context

The most important argument of this article is that progressive summarization and building a second brain is so important even if they're time-consuming because if the creative urge arrives, they facilitate easy creation. I think Rem would love this approach to doing work because it actually works with the ebb and flow of creation rather than strenuous discipline.

“ **the fundamental driver of creative work today is not values, goals, or processes, but unique states of mind**.”

“ **subtle shades of subjective consciousness are the only irreducible, indivisible things in the universe — the quarks out of which souls and narratives are built**.”

“Productivity as we know it is based on delayed gratification, which described a world that was predictable and structured. It was clear what you had to do and in what order — it was just a matter of scheduling and pain tolerance. But **delayed gratification is obsolete in a world dominated by VUCA, because the pain you’re pulling into the present might not even be necessary, and the gratification you’re pushing into the future might never materialize. It is not at all clear what must be done and in what order**; in fact, it becomes ever more clear that ::most of the tasks we execute don’t make much of a difference, while a tiny percentage randomly and dramatically influence the course of our work and our lives.:: It makes sense to invest more and more resources in making that distinction, because the absolute fastest way to complete a task or reach an objective is to realize you don’t have to.”

“But access to tools, locations, and people is no longer the primary constraint in doing valuable work. Nor do “energy levels” come close to capturing the subtleties of human motivation. I believe we’re entering a new era: Mood-First Productivity. **States of mind, or more colloquially, moods, are bubbling up to the surface as every external constraint on work falls away, one after the other.** ”

“This leads us to a definition for **“state of mind”**:

**difficult or expensive to reproduce (in contrast to simple emotions)**

**illegible and more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts (in contrast to cause-and-effect habits)**

**primarily somatic and affective, not intellectual (in contrast to belief systems or worldviews)**

**temporary and ephemeral (in contrast to mindsets or attitudes)** ”

“A given state of mind is difficult to reproduce even for someone who’s experienced it in the past,”

“What makes this interesting in the business world is that **states of mind, unlike productivity frameworks and business models, are extremely difficult (if not impossible) to imitate. Cultural states of mind powerfully resist measurement and analysis, because they flow through the little understood channels of the human subconscious.** ”

“States of mind drastically influence the amount of energy it takes to complete a given task, which gives them leverage.”

“Similarly, we often forget that **the first stage in reaching that “state of flow” we all crave is actually struggle.** You cannot reach the state of “optimal experience” — what Daniel Goleman describes as “a feeling of spontaneous joy, even rapture, while performing a task” — without that initial feeling of anxiety and fidgetiness. This is the true toll of constant interruptions: **with each distraction you stop and start the process again and again, never quite getting past the struggle stage** to the flood of mood-enhancing neurochemicals.”

“For example, Sarah Perry recently described **“borrowed-scenery creativity,” the practice of using background scenery as an element in your composition**. I cannot think of a better example of a **“background” to mental processes than moods.”**

“What is a **“self-created context”** if not **a purposefully created state of mind**?”

“o our mental process feeds itself explosive inspirations without the need for outside stimulus.””

“The key words there are “feeds itself.” Learning new facts and gaining new perspectives is valuable as raw material, but **the moment of creative breakthrough is almost always driven by a mysterious internal process** variously called the Muse, the Resistance, and the Gift. **Only internal feedback loops can reach the speed and internal coherence necessary for the act of synthesis.** ”

“unusually creative people are characterized by “their ability to mix seemingly incompatible states of being depending on the task, whether it’s open attention with a focused drive, mindfulness with daydreaming, intuition with rationality, intense rebelliousness with respect for tradition, etc.” (also called “blends of emotions”). **Affective engagement — the extent to which people are open to the full breadth and depth of their emotions — was found to be a better predictor of artistic creativity than IQ or intellectual engagement.** ”

“in the near future companies will offer their employees a full range of psychotherapeutic, psychosomatic bodywork, cognitive behavioral therapy, and related services as a means to expanding their emotional engagement and enhancing their performance. They’ve caught on to the power of external spaces and experiences as a means of enhancing perceptual filters, and this inner work will be a natural counterpart. The emerging organizational framework of Psychological Capital (PsyCap) seeks to “evaluate the overall resourceful state of workers” in terms of self-efficacy, optimism, resilience, and hope — this is the right idea, but I think these are better described as ephemeral states of mind, not some sort of commoditized resource.”

“My point here is that I believe **states of mind are not just cool trips, but concrete competitive assets**. **The more states you have access to, and the better you are at juggling them from situation to situation, the more you will be able to leverage intellectual knowledge with more-difficult-to-Google tacit knowledge.** ”

“For me personally, giving states of mind their due has helped me understand how **misfortunes, undesired circumstances, and mid-life crises can become the seeds of great strengths: people avoid these things so aggressively that the states of mind they impart are rare, and valuable**.”

- I find this really interesting. I went through depression. I experienced a mental state that most people didn’t have. Because of this, I am able to see the world differently. And it can’t be recreated. It is so rare and therefore so valuable.

“Reading that book again and again as an impressionable teenager, it slowly gave me a sense (or state of mind) that history is inherently epic and meaningful. Whether you agree or not, it is a useful state of mind to have at your disposal during moments of existential dread.”

“I’ve also come to appreciate that **every state of mind is highly adapted to a specific context, like a specialized tool.** ”

“Brazilian culture says that the social reality is the only reliable reality, which is not a bad guide to what research tells us is essential for happiness.”

“But I think states of mind can shed new light on an old idea: that **we are actually different selves across time, and reaching our goals requires getting them to cooperate. The main difference between these selves is not information content. It is in their respective states of mind — how they feel about themselves and their place in the world.** ”

“ **What if we thought of our different selves as literally completely different people, with different priorities, skills, and attitudes? How could we use principles of self-organization to get them to work together toward common goals, assuming they are driven primarily by ephemeral states of mind?** ”

“ **The four requirements are:**

**Alignment: getting the selves to push in the same direction, so they’re not fighting against each other**

**Specialization: getting the selves to complement each others’ efforts by focusing on the activities they are best suited for**

**Workflow: getting the selves to hand off tasks to each other efficiently, so they can be completed in stages over time**

**Aggregation: the assembly of the previous results into a final product** ”

“ **If we consider that our numerous selves have very different priorities, Alignment of their actions becomes more important, and harder.** Instead of forcing all of them — past, present, and future — to line up with an unchanging predetermined outcome (a “mission” or “purpose”), it makes more sense to start with what excites your current self right now, and then work from there to define that motivation in increasingly subtle shades over time. The more precise your understanding of what exactly excites you about any particular project, the better your ability to generalize it to other projects and topics — to thread and follow that particular needle winding through the haystack of life.”

“Assuming these numerous selves have different skills, it makes sense for them to Specialize. But that means **we need a mechanism for matching each self to the right task. There are two basic ways of doing this: learning how to change your mood to match the task at hand, and to change the task at hand to match your mood.** Both are useful under different circumstances. Changing your mood to match the task is the realm of self-talk and environmental cues”

“ **Changing the task to match your mood is the goal of distributed, self-organizing tools** like kanban boards and ticketing systems, where each person works on whatever matches their skills and state of mind at that moment. Personal kanban boards are an example of applying these tools to a team of selves, instead of a team of people.”

“ **“There is no need to plan when a particular agent should execute a particular task, as long as enough agents are available so that a sufficiently skilled one is ready to take over soon after the previous task is finished.” That’s a hefty requirement. This means that Calm but Focused Me needs to be able to hand off whatever he’s working on to another instance of Calm but Focused Me in such a way that both the current progress and the state of mind are preserved as accurately as possible. Because these two instances are often separated by days, weeks, or months (in an environment of numerous simultaneous projects and constant emergencies), this handoff cannot rely on storing these states in memory, nor can it deteriorate over time.”**

**“** Because these different selves show up rather unpredictably at different times, a Workflow is required to coordinate their actions across time.”

“ **This requirement is the real motive for an iterative summarization approach to note-taking (briefly, summarizing notes, and then summarizing the summary, etc. in a pyramid-like structure, using formatting that allows you to see each level of summarization separately). It’s relatively time-consuming, but I’m willing to put in all of that effort because, when the creative mood appears, I want to be able to integrate as many sources as possible before that temporary state of mind passes** (or the responsibilities of real life come knocking). I’m time-shifting as much mundane reading and summarizing as possible from that precious, creative state of mind to other, more common mental states”

“In other words, the true purpose of note-taking is transporting states of mind (not just information) through time. This is why pictures, sketches, and diagrams often work better than text. We don’t usually think of them as notes, but songs, smells, and tastes work even better.”

““A visual model becomes one of the most effective tools for minimizing alignment-attrition; a visualization formalizes an emergent idea and solidifies it at a moment in time.””

““ **To return to a book is to return not just to the text but also to a past self.** We are embedded in our libraries. To reread is to remember who we once were, which can be equal parts scary and intoxicating.”

“There is one bright side to all this hard work: **the only way to crystallize a state of mind is to use affective triggers to decide what to take notes on and keep. Instead of making a mini-outline of each book and article and podcast you consume, trying to preserve the logical structure of the argument, just wait in low-power mode for reactions like surprise, delight, intrigue, and outrage. This System 1 processing is much faster, less energy intensive, and more intuitive than the more analytical System 2. To take this approach means your notes will not be neat and ordered, like a Dewey Decimal system for the mind. They will be dominated by the contrarian, by paradoxes, by the inexplicable. Which is exactly the point. Contrarianism is the fastest method for discovering the paradox at the heart of every inexplicable phenomenon.** ”

“ **Aggregation is necessary to turn all these diverse efforts into a final product. Having access to more diverse states of mind allows you to create more diverse definitions of success — a crucial skill for shaping and moving into zones of expanding possibility.** ”

“This is Waitzkin’s first level of high-performance — flowing with whatever comes. If you’ve learned how to find boredom useful by, say, keeping a stash of reading material handy at all times, you can find that 2-hour delay to be an opportunity. This is the second level — using whatever comes to your advantage.”

“What I’m referring to here is multifinality. Whereas multitasking refers to seeking multiple outputs from multiple simultaneous inputs, and is impossible, **multifinality refers to attaining alternative objectives from the same inputs, and is eminently possible.** ”

“These questions allow you to kill two birds with one stone, each present self making life easier on multiple future selves in an expanding, branching tree of optionality. Crucially, multifinality doesn’t take more time or resources or effort — just a more diverse set of lenses to see that any action can have multiple non-exclusive outcomes.”

“If you’ve been thinking it’s strange to think of diverse life experiences and inner work as a means to something as mundane as productivity, you’re right — the reverse is true. It’s more accurate to say that **productivity, or creating more value in the world as efficiently and effectively as possible, is one of many paths on a journey of personal growth.** ”

“Many have commented on the rise of chaos and complexity in the modern world, but we forget what the yogis have always known —  **our inner lives have always been chaotic and complex.** States of mind are a better guide to modern work than values (which don’t always motivate), goals (which often change), and processes (which try to prescribe the unprescribable) precisely because moods are the only things that change just as fast as the world around us.**I suspect this is where that elusive Level 3 of performance can be found — clearing the in-between space of enough biases, fears, and defenses that our inner inspirations can explode into creative “earthquakes” as efficiently as possible.** ”

““People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life,…[but] I think that **what we’re seeking is an experience of life, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.** ””

“Thinking about the value inherent in every unique state of mind, and how one can actively pursue and assimilate these states, I’m struck by a quote by Picasso: “It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child.” You could say that his work was a technology of forgetting. It’s encouraging to realize that many of the states of mind we seek are not “out there” somewhere, to be hunted down and consumed. They are states of mind belonging to our past selves — we wouldn’t crave it if we had never experienced it. We have to go backwards and remember what we once knew, not forwards to some perfected version of ourselves.”

“Your future lies in your past. Learning is forgetting.”
