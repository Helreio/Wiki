# Arguments behind the dominant coronavirus pandemic narrative

1. The coronavirus emerged from evolution.
2. The coronavirus is extremely deadly.
3. The PCR test used to discriminate between non-infectious and infectious individuals is reliable.
4. The number of infections and deaths attributed to the coronavirus is reliable (because of argument #3).
5. The number of infections and deaths suggest that we are indeed experiencing a highly virulent and deadly pandemic.
6. Because of #5, it is justifiable to release under a state of emergency to the public, vaccines that are still under investigation, with no long-term and short-term data on their effects.
7. The benefits of the vaccines outweigh their risk and are generally safe.
8. The vaccines are doing their job to curb infection rates.
