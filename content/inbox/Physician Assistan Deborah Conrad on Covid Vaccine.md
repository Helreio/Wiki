# Physician Assistan Deborah Conrad on Covid Vaccine

17 years PA

Took care of many Covid patients

Tests were unreliable

- Some patients showed symptoms but were negative.
- They were repeatedly tested until they become positive.
- This led to unnecessary exposures

50 percent of the staff were hesitant to get vaccinated

The doctors however had very few hesitations

- Doctors are trained to be lapdogs of pharmaceutical companies
- Their books and continuing education are sponsored by pharma

Many physicians got sick

Lots of patients got back with unusual illnesses they didnt have before they took the shot.

These were people with no commorbidities: young etc.

They developed blood clots even when they were already in blood thinners

Countries are already reporting side effects but they downplay them. The reporting is dependent on each countries gov
