# William James on living life as if it mattered

Despite a life-long tendency to depression, insomnia and bad nerves, James embraced a philosophy of optimism, hope, faith and energy. He insisted we are not helpless spectators in a meaningless universe. We are co-creators of reality, possessed of powers and energies we don’t fully grasp or use. And the universe, somehow, cares what we each of us do with our lives.

First, he rejected materialist determinism, and chose to believe in free will. He declared: ‘My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will.’ Why, he decided, would evolution bother to select something as energy-intensive as consciousness if it didn’t actually *do* anything?

He started to form his own theory of the function of consciousness. He decided that we have a ‘stream of consciousness’, which we choose to direct through our attention. Consciousness is *selective* — out of all the noisy information flooding at us, it selects what to bring into focus. This selection is guided by what we care about, what we think is important. Our attention then guides our emotions and our actions. Through our repeated choices and actions, we create habits, and out of our habits, we carve our worlds.

The Stoic / CBT answer is that emotions are cognitive judgements. For example, we see someone frowning at us (A), we interpret it through an opinion like ‘she doesn’t like me’ (B), and that opinion leads to the physical feeling of emotion ( C). As Epictetus said ‘it’s not events, but our opinion about events, that cause us suffering’.

James turned this on its head. He suggested that emotions aren’t cognitive judgements, but rather somatic reactions. We see a bear (A), our body leaps into action, activating our fight or flight response ( C ) and then as we run away screaming our reason catches up and notices ‘I am frightened’ (B).

What did James finally believe? He had no final beliefs. Life is a process, a journey, a search, and he never closed his accounts or settled on one answer for long. He was always open to new influences and ideas, and wary of ossification into old-fogeyism (which he thought often began around the age of 25).
