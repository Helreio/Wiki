# What it felt like to leave a religion?

Story: the first memorial I purposefully missed. Ever since I was a child, I went to this gathering. It's the most basic gathering. Even non jws who go to it once felt like they could get saved.

Why did I arrived at that situation?

I wanted to kill myself. But before I did so, I wanted to challenge God. Prove him wrong.

I committed what the religion labels a sexual misconduct.

I hid it for months until my gf admitted the sin to the elders. I was called. Told I will serve a month of reproof then I can come back. Then later

WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

Atheism -> but saw hatred

Discovered Dave Ursillo and spirituality without religion. I realized I still had spiritual inclinations.

I studied yoga, zen, advaita, and all the hippie stuff. -> saw that much like my previous religion, my rationality was abused

Met Steve Patterson which led me to seriously consider philosophy.

WHAT I CURRENTLY BELIEVE IN AND WHAT I HOPE TO DO NEXT

The reason why I went through these paths is becase like many who were attracted to reigion, spirituality, and philosophy, I was looking for meaning. Awe was easy for me. Identifying beauty is almost automatic. But there wqere lots of questions I needed answers for.

I could find meaning without leaving the comfort of reason. I could believe on beauty without being illogical.

My dream is to live an integral life: a lif where my actions are aligned to my intentions. This requires self-awareness. Only when i am aware can i know what i want.

Religions have monopolized these questions. But they don't have to. We shouldnt outsource the most important questions we need to answer to others

Some of us go to philosophy just because we have nothing else to do. Some of us go to philosophy because it will save our life.
