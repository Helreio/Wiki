# Individual parts of the work I will create

A history of Banua (Awaran na saray agaw-gawa ed Banua)

- A written historical record of events that happened in Banua
- Written by a fictional character who writes in baybayin
- The history is written in the Pangasinan language using the baybayin alphabet
- Then I will translate it in Tagalog and English
- The way the history was written should reflect the process a historian goes through (uses written documents, material culture, and oral history)
- However, the medieval process of using footnotes and citation styles will not be used. Instead sources will be presented in the text, narrated and described.
- In the history of Banua, writing was discovered by a certain individual. However, it became a taboo to protect the ownership of songs. Writers were subversives.
