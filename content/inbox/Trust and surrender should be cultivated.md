# Trust and surrender should be cultivated

Trust and surrender should be cultivated because of the fact that there is so little we can truly control.

Therefore the wise step is this:

- since you can control your attention, control that
- Since you cannot control other things, let go, have faith, surrender on your ability to respond appropriately to whatever the world throws to you.
