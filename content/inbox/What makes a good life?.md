# What makes a good life?

A good life is a life where one's emotions are predominantly the emotions that one desires (cf. [[The quality of my entire life is the quality of my habitual emotions - Tony Robbins]]).

To generate my desired emotions I need to do some [[Actions to take to experience an emotion intentionally]].

To have a good life, one may need the following:

- Peace of mind
- Time affluence
- Control over one’s attention
- Routine
- Being around good people
- Being around nurturing spaces
- An active intentional curation of the aspects of one’s life that is both flexible but effective in generating positive emotions
