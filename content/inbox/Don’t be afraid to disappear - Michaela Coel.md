# Don’t be afraid to disappear - Michaela Coel

“Write the tale that scares you. That makes you feel uncertain. That isn’t comfortable. I dare you. In a world that entices us to browse through the lives of others to help us better determine how we feel about ourselves, and to in turn feel the need to be constantly visible — for visibility these days seems to somehow equate to success — **don’t be afraid to disappear from it, from us, for a while and see what comes to you in the silence**.”
