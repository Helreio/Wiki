# Square One axioms

Certain foundations necessarily exist and are inescapable.

Wrong foundations = wrong worldview.

Foundations are categorically more important than conclusions.

If you are interested in building an accurate worldview, focus on the foundations, not the conclusions.

Trusting is not a reliable method in serious intellectual investigation of the premises and foundations of a worldview.

When you trust, you outsource your critical thinking to somebody else. This creates room for error.

Most people never examine their foundations and, therefore, do not deeply understand their own ideas.

Radical, intense, and uncomfortable skepticism is the most reliable method for serious intellectual investigation.

Assume everything you believe, everything you’ve heard, and everything other people believe is wrong.

See if any knowledge can fully withstand an onslaught of skeptical reasoning.

The careful skeptic must not close his mind to the possibility that certain knowledge may or may not exist.

“I am certain that certain knowledge doesn’t exist!” is a contradiction.

To insist that “Truth cannot be known!” regardless of the evidence is dogmatic.

The longer a worldview goes unexamined, the more difficult it becomes to revise.

It doesn’t matter how elaborate or beautiful a theory is. It doesn’t matter how long you’ve believed it. If it’s foundationally mistaken, it should be discarded.

If certain truth exists - knowledge which cannot possibly be wrong - then that can serve as a trustworthy foundation for the rest of our worldview.

If they don’t exist, then we must accept the fact that our belief systems are without ultimate justification, and we’re stuck only with best-guesses.

To get from conclusions to premises, ask “why?” repeatedly.

Some truths are so foundational that the question “why?” does not apply.

These truths are not contingent on other premises; they are necessary.

Every other idea presupposes these truths.

They are certain, absolute, and objective.

Without them, one cannot even have coherent thoughts.
