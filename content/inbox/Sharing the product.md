# Sharing the product

After nurturing my insights enough or testing my methods and systems for myself, I can then share what I learn. [[Sharing]] will ideally follow a sequential process, which applies the principles of the [[Cautious sharing process]].

While [[Sharing the process]] involves, for example, sharing my [[Talahardin]], the following furnished artifacts can be shared:

- Share the story of how you discovered or followed a trail of thought.
- Share how you applied a certain practice or thought in your life.
- Share a creative artifact inspired by your research and experiences (e.g., [[Creative philosophical artifact]]).

In your blog, each of these artifacts could be a category of their own.
