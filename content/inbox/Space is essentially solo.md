# Space is essentially solo

Why are empty spaces like this alluring? Especially when the are taken cared of. Are they reminders of solitude? Perhaps all spaces are spaces of solitude. Sans people they will be silent spaces. It persuades me to conclude that spaces are essentially solo. Creation might be right and so is evolution. But whether we accept one from the other, the truth is that there was a point in the narrative when human consciousness was non existent. It was all just space alone by itself.
