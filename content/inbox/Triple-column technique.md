# Triple-column technique

The aim of the triple-column technique is to substitute illogical and harsh thoughts that automatically flood your mind during negative events with more objective rational thoughts. It is a [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]] technique.

[[David Burns]] advices that practicing the triple-column technique for even just 15 minutes every day over a period of 1-2 months makes it easier. I personally find it a very important practice in applying philosophy in everyday life that it should be practiced daily as one would practice [[thoughts/meditation]].

Here is [[How to use the triple-column technique]].
