# Summary

After going through a not-so-easy process, which was both emotionally and logistically challenging, I was finally able to transfer to LB. I finally saw Lea after exactly 300 days. I finally saw friends I haven’t seen since the pandemic as well as friends I first made online. I experienced their welcome and support as I moved in and settle on my own place. Through them, I also made new friends. While in LB, I realized that I got a lot of realizations simply by staying here. The environment changes everything to my psyche. After seeing all the awesome things my friends and new friends are doing, I was challenged to ask myself: What do I want to do with this one awesome life I have? I know I am doing stuff but, can I articulate them well enough to declare what I want to do to the entire world? What is it really that I stand for? What is it really that I want to do? How am I doing what I want to do? How am I contributing? I realized that I was missing a lot of helpful feedback just by being far from creative friends. While I enjoyed a lot of the social gatherings, I also realized how much limited I really am with my energy. So I need to limit it so I can give it to the right people at the right time. While here, I tasted the good food of LB, streamlined my process of doing an annual review, and explored Craft as my new second brain app.

## Insights and Lessons

- I tried out Roam but realized it wasn't really for me. I decided not to commit to it or even take advantage of the scholarship.
- Learned how to export notes from Roam to Bear, and explored Bear.
- “I have identified my truth a long time ago, and my truth does not stay here, nor will it stay anywhere else. But it needs to grow in a place of its home, far from where I came from. It is difficult, but I need to do this for myself. And I need to do it now.”
- Explored doing evergreen note-taking in Notion and realized how cumbersome it was.
- “I have a wonderful set of friends. I have friends who I know will love me unconditionally. I am grateful for them. I want to support them in their own journeys too.”
- Being prompted to think more about the signal I provide to people in terms of the work I do. Vec’s invitation is tempting. The prestige that comes from being a lecturer in UP is interesting. But the job will take time away from what I want to do: my art, my mission, my research. What happened prompted me to really think about what I do and how I communicate it. This psychological conundrum also helped me see where I may have a problem. There are fears that I have. There is inner work I need to do.
- I explored and learned more about The Circle Way.
- Listening to Gian talk, contributing a few ideas, and being challenged entirely: What is it really that I stand for? What is it really that I want to do? How am I doing what I want to do? How am I contributing?
- Deciding to go here in LB and really persevering, going past the emotional and logistical hurdles. It is worth it. LB has what I need to grow, even if not in the outside, but inside.
- My life. Everything I have to go through since leaving college in 2013. This was my life. This is my life. I need to really, really love every single piece of it.
- Realized: I am enjoying these social gatherings. I am realizing how much I’ve missed all those years because I am not exposed to people. And I need to make the most out of this opportunity. But I also need to keep them in check so that I have enough energy for “other” social gatherings, especially when I will be connecting with people who are more aligned with what I want to do. I need to be mindful of how I spend my time. I need to feel aligned in this area of my life. What can I do? Drop LPH, order only one item from Ome, drop Sunday dates (or do it at least alternately, tell them you will use Sunday for Lea’s siblings), have Fruit Salad limited to fortnightly (tell them that you will need more time to develop a project, you need to maintain a certain momentum). Keep bahay-bahayan. But, don’t over commit. Finalize schedule with Lea.
