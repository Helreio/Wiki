# Lessons from 2021 - Andy Matuschak

I think we can develop a relationship to creative work in which the doing in each moment is joyful, irrespective of the outcome.

stop taking this suffering as a given, and to interrogate it instead.

*Why* is the feeling of confusion uncomfortable? Why specifically do I feel pain when I spend all day poking at a problem without feeling any real progress? What am I worried would happen if I just let myself fall into the problem’s contours, to let it take as long as it takes, whether or not I find an answer? For me, when I dig far enough, the answers usually bottom out in social anxieties of various kinds. Fear of not achieving “enough”, of appearing incapable, foolish, slow, unoriginal; these feelings arise in turn from deeper fears of not “belonging”, not being accepted by others.

Some friends have found that their creative suffering stems from a sort of self-flagellation: they’ve convinced themselves that creative success is just a matter of will, and so if they fail to make progress, that’s a sign of their own essential weakness as an individual. In this scheme, creative troubles produce self-loathing rather than compassion and curiosity.

It is possible to rewire your emotional system so that the creative experience does not cause suffering.

Abating creative suffering has been one part of the solution for me; the second is its mirror: cultivating creative joy. It’s possible to draw much more satisfaction from the moment-to-moment experiences of creative work.

I’d only understood that in a purely practical sense: when you focus on product in creative work, you’ll often produce worse work. But the adage also applies to the emotional experience. The outcome can’t be the daily reward. It’s too far away, too uncertain. That’s a brittle source of satisfaction. The _process_has to feel rewarding, too.

Happily, I’ve found that the moment-to-moment experience of my work is quite rewarding once I get out of my own way: the pleasure of following a trail of curiosity; the serendipity of making little connections; the surprise of noticing I’m confused in an unexpected way; the satisfaction of choosing a better word to sharpen my understanding. It’s surprisingly engrossing to watch the gears of my own mind turn.

Too often “productivity” and “motivation” techniques treat a symptom without addressing its cause. I don’t want to train myself to shout over my impulses, especially when my work depends on following creative instinct. I’d rather cultivate a healthier relationship to the sensations of doing the work, in the moment, so that my impulses will naturally serve me well.
