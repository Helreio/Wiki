# Identity and Constant Change

Aristotle said that a thing that constantly changes looses its identity.

First of all, there are two things happening here:

1. The outside stuff
2. Our mind concept of the outside stuff

Our concepts seem to provide the identity of stuff

The problem is, usually, our idea of a concept is that it shouldn’t change.

What I see is that the outside stuff is always changing, and it is what it is at any given moment, it has an inherent identity (but it is unlike our former ideas about identity, this is Patterson’s existence = identity).

If the outside stuff is always changing, so is its identity. A stuff is a collection of identitities. It is what it is at any given time.

The problems here then are:

- What is the smallest unit of time which accounts for what is the unchanging reality of stuff? In this analysis, should we be finitist (there is an indivisible unit of time which is associates with what is an identity) or infinitist (there is no indivisible unit = the stuff has no identity = it does not exist)
- What is time? Is it constant? The same with space?
