# His family was isolated.

Her father has forgetfulness and only remembers glimpses of the past.

What he do remembers are the rituals and the rules.

They are a family of five.

He has two more siblings their age dispersed.

Each live on a portion of the land to develop personal freedom at an early age.

Then their life turned upside down when strange visitors came.
