# The high-order bit for my productivity is whether I complete a deeply-focused morning creative block

“good day” = uninterrupted 4 hour working session

- deep focus and clarity on a project

to do this

- consistently clear our mornnings for a 4-5 hour work block
- block distractions
- get clear on your projects and their goals (using a writing practice)
- tackle scattered mind: not settling on one problem, jumping around questions, solving convenient but unimportant problems, mind wandering, dullness because of lack of stimulation

How to tackle a scattered mind

- Meditation
- Continuous metacognitive awareness
- Get curious
- Get playful
- Practice being comfortable being lost and still making progress despite it
