# The external physical world is made up of countless individual units of matter

This theory is called “metaphysical pluralism.” The main argument of this theory is that the world comes up with an incomprehensible amount of base units.

This theory presupposes that [[an external objective physical world exists]]. This physical world is a three-dimensional grid. [[The external physical world is made up of countless individual units of matter]]. These units are fundamental units of space-time or geometry, which are in a particular state. Our minds then create objects by rearranging these individual units of matter and then creating a boundary for them.

What we interpret as objects are actually conceptual creations of our mind, which are simply rearrangements of these individual units of matter. Our mind puts these fundamental units together then creates a boundary for them to create an object.
