Personality is actually a hierarchy, which only has two above

1. Stability - how much order you like in your life
2. Plasticity - how much you like to engage in the world

Plasticity encompasses extroversion and openness to experience.

But there are different ways to engage with the world.

- Behavioral engagement; assertiveness; potential reward from your environment
- Openness to experience: deep fantasy, thinking

Stability = serotonin

Plasticity = dopamine

Dopamine is not about pleasure. It’s about getting excited about the “possibility”. It increases your sensitivity to the reward value of information.

Extroverts experience increase excitement on the rewards from their environment (evolutionary, ancestral rewards: social attention, social status, money, sexual partners, food).

Introversion is a preference for quiet, being reserved, being more cautious about the environment. They have increase excitement on the potential reward value of information. This is a characteristic that sets humans apart from animals.

Introverts

- Solitude
- Day-dreaming

“Imagination Network” (a brain network)

- Becomes active when we turn our attention inward (our own thoughts); we don’t quickly jump to things but we deeply reflect
- This is associated with creativity and compassion (your capacity to imagine your future is associated with your capacity to imagine someone else’s thoughts).
- This is open to both introverts and extroverts, but this is mostly prevalent among introverts who have high openness to experience.
- Reflective, think about the meaning of your life and experiences
- Poets, writers

Shyness occurs because of neuroticism (not introversion).

Being unsociable occurs becuase of being disagreeable (not introversion).

It’s not that introverts don’t like people, it’s just that they don’t get much value from it.

Social attention (being the center of attention or the life of the party) is something that does not appeal much to extroverts.
