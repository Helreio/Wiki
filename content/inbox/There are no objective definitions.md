# There are no objective definitions

There are no objective definitions for words. All definitions are subjective by their nature. [[A definition of X is simply what we mean by X]]. [[Meaning is a mental construction]]. [[Words do not possess meaning by themselves]].

I can invent my own word. I can invent my own language. If that language becomes popular, we can create our own dictionary. But [[A dictionary is simply a collection of commonly-agreed-upon definitions]] of the words I invented. It makes communication easier. But [[Consensual does not mean objective]].

Meaning atrributed to objects other than words are also subjective. [[There is no objective meaning]].
