# AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL ON HOW NOT TO GIVE A FUCK

Steps

1. Do something so radical that people who once knew you will never understand (like leaving your childhood religion because an elite group of people living in New York, people you've never met, are dictating to you when to have sex or whether or not you should go to college).
2. Find the life you were born to live and the people you were born to be with.
3. Mind your own life. Convince yourself that comparing yourself to others is the new original sin.
4. Repeat #3 until it becomes second nature.
5. Be amazed. Be very amazed that so many people have been talking about you and your radical change, coming up with various theories about what happened to you. And you're just hearing tidbits of these 6 years after the change happened! That's when you know you've lived THE life and have not given a fuck to naysayers.
