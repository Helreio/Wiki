# The best travels I had were not escapes but returns.

They were travels when I was not escaping my life.

They were travels when I was returning to who I was.

I don't see any more meaningful purpose for traveling than to explore one's inner world.

This is inescapable.

No matter where we go we are still within ourselves.

There is no other way to experience life.

Once you change how you see your travels or any other journey in your life, you might realize how much you know or dont know about yourself.

Perhaps that's why I haven't been traveling a lot lately. I have learned how to be perfectly be fine within myself.
