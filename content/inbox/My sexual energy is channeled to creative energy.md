# My sexual energy is channeled to creative energy

When I am in deep contemplation and creativity, my sex drive is not that strong. This means that my sexuality is not the most important thing in my life. It is not the main thing. It is not my life work for one. So,  I need to only give it the attention that is proportionate to its importance. It will stay as an interest to be constantly explored.

Yes, I will invest in tools, etc., but I am the happiest when I spend time researching, reading, and contemplating about life and ideas. Therefore, I will focus on these while continuing to nurture my sexuality on the side.
