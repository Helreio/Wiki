The most valuable thing most likely will be to carve out a large block of time (maybe the time that otherwise the course participation would have consumed) and just sit down and do a big picture assessment of your work, your current workflows, your reference material (it’s quality and amount) and question whether things are worth keeping at all and if so to what extend and identify inefficiencies.

Find your own system and most importantly try it for a given period of time. Maybe make this a regular appointment. Take a Saturday of each month to do this maybe. I’ve always failed to do this, if I didn’t set out a block of uninterrupted time.

But I got way more value from browsing the Zettelkästen forums and website than I ever did with BASB, which fails, I think, to adequately capture the complexity of the world, despite its lofty ambitions.

I get the uncomfortable vibe that it tries way too hard to replicate the GTD success, but where David Allen sold a book that was a huge success and he built a company around it, it feels like BASB is trying to create a similar narrative but without as much depth.

He asks the right questions, and in very deep and insightful ways. I do not think he has found the framework, though (contrary to Allen). Niklas Luhmann, of Zettelkästen fame, has been much closer in my opinion.

[zettelkasten.de](http://zettelkasten.de/)  [39](http://zettelkasten.de/) (no worries, it’s in English) is absolutely essential, but unfortunately there’s not really an overall “getting started” type summary there. One of the blog authors does have a book but I’d recommend waiting for the much-expanded second edition he’s working on. Meanwhile, Sönke Ahrens’ book How to Take Smart Notesapproaches Zettelkasten from a slightly different angle and is probably the best current entry point in English.

If you really want to explore how different people have approached personal knowledge management, you might also want to take a look at [Lion Kimbro’s work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16174518-how-to-make-a-complete-map-of-every-thought-you-think)  [36](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16174518-how-to-make-a-complete-map-of-every-thought-you-think), although I definitely wouldn’t recommend adopting his actual methods. Author Steven B. Johnson’s early-2000s [essays](https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/devonthink-continued-94e972b6d2f)  [27](https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/devonthink-continued-94e972b6d2f) on his use of DEVONthink are also still worth a look. And Robert Pirsig, author of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, has a brief but interesting description of how he used a Zettelkasten-like index card system in the sequel [Lila](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/131519/lila-by-robert-pirsig/)
