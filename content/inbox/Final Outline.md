Where did Thoreau live?

- United States of America
- State of Massachusetts
- Middlesex County
- Concord

What kind of place was Concord?

- Once called Musketaquid, which is also what they call the river. It means “grass-ground or marsh-grass river” (from the same root word for mosquito).
   - Later, Thoreau would name his boat Musketaquid.
- Even before the English arrived, an epidemic have already reduced 90% of the Native population.
- The English moved to Musketaquid and renamed it Concord.
- Concord launched America’s Manifest Destiny; it was, quite literally, America’s first West.
- 1644, the Native population under the leadership of Tahatawan petitioned to become Christian subjects of the English crown.
- Concord was also the place where the American Revolution began.
   - This inspired Thoreau in his own “revolution” of a way of life.
- By the time Thoreau was born, Concord was already a busy town that has lost the old world of the Natives (for example, no more deers) and is slowly embracing the effects of industrialization.

What kind of family did Thoreau have?

- Genealogy
   - The very name Thoreau (pronounced like the word “thorough” was novel—foreign, French, part of a Revolutionary wave of restlessness that carried European immigrants into New England’s market towns and industrial centers.
- Parents
   - Father: John Thoreau Sr. (1787-1859) 72 y/o
      - Descended from French protestant migrants.
      - Run a pencil business.
   - Mother: Cynthia Dunbar Thoreau (1787-1872) 85 y/o
      - Outspoken woman who led the underground slavery abolitionist movement
- Siblings
   - Helen Thoreau (1812-1849) 37 y/o
      - Teacher and antislavery activist.
      - Died of tuberculosis.
   - John Thoreau (1815-1842) 27 y/o
      - Run the Thoreau school with Henry for three years.
      - In 1842, at age 27, he accidentally cut himself with a razor and died of lockjaw.
   - David Henry Thoreau (1817-1862) 45 y/o
   - Sophia Thoreau (1819-1876) 57 y/o
      - Teacher and antislavery activist.
      - She managed her brothers writings for publishing posthumously.
      - Very much like Thoreau.
- The role that family played in Thoreau’s creative life
   - Thoreau was single until death and while he lived in other places (Walden Pond, Emerson’s estate, New York), he was always living with his family.
   - His contented homelife provided the stability Thoreau needed to pursue his career the way that he did.
   - Without such a stable and contented homelife, Thoreau could not possibly have pursued his career in the way that he did. He lived in an equitable and interdependent household in which everyone helped out.

What kind of childhood did Thoreau have?

- Thoreau’s birth
   - On July 12, 1817, Cynthia gave birth to a healthy baby boy. They called him Henry.
   - But then, only six weeks later, John’s little brother David died, just after coming of age at twenty-one.
   - So on October 12, when it came time to bring their infant son to the First Parish Church for baptism, they followed family custom and kept the name alive: their second son was baptized David Henry Thoreau.
- Thoreau’s childhood
   - It was a barefoot, knockabout childhood—rough, unfussy, and close to the soil, with animals everywhere.
   - Even as a child, his spirit longed for “that sweet solitude,”
   - His mother told a friend how, when Henry and John still slept together in a trundle bed, “John would go to sleep at once, but Henry often lay long awake. His mother found the little boy lying so one night, long after he had gone upstairs, and said, ‘Why, Henry dear, why don’t you go to sleep?’ ‘Mother’ said he, ‘I have been looking through the stars to see if I couldn’t see God behind them.’”

**_ Lessons from Thoreau’s Creative Life**

Lesson 1: Take care of your material needs.

- “In short, you’ve got to carry on two farms at once,—the farm on the earth and the farm in your mind.” - Thoreau’s letter to H.G.O Blake, 26 September 1859
- Look at your work as a harvest.
- You have two farms
   1. Earth (Material Needs)
   2. Mind
- How did Thoreau take care of his first farm?
   1. He kept his life simple.
   2. He had multiple streams of income.
- How did he keep his life simple?
   - He had a few expenses.
      - Travel
      - Rent at his family’s boarding house
      - Debts to publishers
   - He had almost no taxable properties
      - He chuckled, remembering how he’d flummoxed the tax assessor when he was called in for an inventory of his taxable property. Any real estate? No. Stocks or bonds? No. Any taxable property? “None that I know of”—except his boat.
   - Thoreau bought his freedom by keeping his needs simple and his account books balanced to the half cent.
- How did Thoreau establish multiple streams of income?
   - He became a day laborer, doing various jobs.
      - For a dollar a day, he built fences, painted houses, did carpentry, bricked up at least one chimney, and performed a host of other odd jobs.
   - He got involved in the family’s pencil business.
   - He opened a school with his brother John.
   - He earned from his lectures.
      - He’d given all his lectures for free until October 1848.
   - He earned from his articles.
   - He earned from his books.
   - He became a civil engineer and land surveyor.
      - When lecturing and writing both failed, surveying must pay.
      - Lecturing paid little—most out-of-town lectures earned twenty dollars or so, less travel expenses—and so did manual labor. Far more reliable was the income he earned from surveying.
      - Thoreau would complete more than 150 additional surveying jobs, each requiring days or weeks of hard work.
      - Surveying gave Thoreau a respected professional identity.
      - Surveying also allowed Thoreau to converge the two farms. This happened when he surveyed, not residential or private estates, but natural landscapes.
         - Survey of Walden Pond (show picture).
         - Survey of 22 miles of the Concord River all the way to the dam at Billerica Mills

*Lesson 2: Take care of the children of your brain.*

- "It is easy enough to maintain a family, or a state, but it is hard to maintain these children of your brain (or say, rather, these guests that trust to enjoy your hospitality), they make such great demands; and yet, he who does only the former, and loses the power to think originally, or as only he ever can, fails miserably. Keep up the fires of thought, and all will go well.” - Thoreau’s letter to H.G.O Blake, 26 September 1859
- Thoreau aspired for a mindful cultivation of his inner being and his greater community, a spiritual rather than material growth through education, art, music, and philosophy.
- How did he took care of the children of his brain?
   - He read and collected resonant information.
      - Thoreau filled dozens of notebooks with extracts from hundreds of volumes, creating his own working library.
         - While in Harvard, he only had to attend class for four hours a day. This gave him time to go to nature and to go to the library. In the library, Thoreau began his lifelong habit of keeping a permanent record of his reading by copying extracts into commonplace books.
   - He gathered physical resources and had a place to store these.
      - What Thoreau couldn’t carry away in his notebook, he often carried away in his pockets. Thus it was that the Yellow House attic became a kind of material memory, the place that held and preserved his expanding mental universe: notebooks, journal volumes, books, maps, charts, tables, natural history specimens, and curiosities.
   - He had a room of his own.
      - The “Upper Empire"
         - When Thoreau was starting his life as a writer, he hungered for solitude. He took a room in the attic—what he called his “upper empire,” from whose “perspective window” he could look out on the sunrise and see “all things . . . in their true relations.”
         - There in that upper empire he wrote up his first lecture for the Concord Lyceum, on April 11, 1838, on “Society.”

*Lesson 3: Ground yourself in community.*

- "Friendship is the fruit which the year should bear; it lends its fragrance to flowers, and it is in vain if we get only a large crop of apples without it."—Journal, 13 July 1857
- Surround yourself with people like you no matter how few they are. Make the most of your relationship.
- It isn’t true that he was a hermit. His Walden years are still highly social.
   - Walden Pond was hardly wilderness; it was a familiar part of Concord’s daily life, as it had been for two hundred years. Moving there hardly removed Thoreau from the circles of family, friends, and village life, and he made a point of maintaining his friendships as before.
   - Thoreau declared he kept three chairs: “one for solitude, two for friendship, three for society.”
- What were the most important relationships that Thoreau had?
   - Family
   - Mentor
   - Inner circle
   - Professional relationships (agents, publishers, etc.)
   - Outer circle (organizations)
   - Readers and followers
- How did Thoreau take advantage of his relationships?
   - Family
      - Thoreau was always embedded in family until he died. He paid rent, managed the family business and estates after his father died, while he had them do his laundry.
   - Mentors
      - Emerson
         - His lifelong dialogue with Emerson would turn Thoreau into a great and wholly original writer. Thoreau’s creativity was realized not alone but in partnership, as Emerson fanned his creativity into genius.
         - He lived under Emerson’s house twice (1841-1843 around the time John his brother died, and 1847-1848 when Emerson was away for his grand lecture tour of Europe).
         - While living in Emerson’s house, he exchanged his expertise as a gardener, handyman, tutor, and caretaker with free use of Emerson’s library, association with Emerson’s friends and visitors, and Emerson’s mentorship.
         - Thoreau witnessed a professional writer and lecturer’s life daily. He patterned what he wanted his career to be after Emerson.
         - Emerson also provided him with the land he need to build a house at Walden pond where he lived for two years and wrote his most important public work.
   - Inner circle
      - Transcendentalists
         - Who are the transcendentalists?
         - Most important transcendentalist friends of Thoreau
            - William Ellery Channing
               - Favorite walking buddy of Thoreau
            - Margaret Fuller
               - Thoreau’s mentor in poetry
            - Amos Bronson Alcott
               - Father of Louisa May Alcott who wrote Little Women
               - Did not finish school but very intellectual
               - Founded an experimental utopia Fruitlands that embraced transcendentalist values but only lasted half a year
               - Thoreau’s model in protesting by not paying taxes
      - Locals
         - George Minott
            - One of the few locals that Thoreau really admired and liked
         - Nathaniel Hawthorne
            - Former neighbor
            - Helped Thoreau get picked up by publishers in New York
   - Readers
      - Harrison Gray Otis Blake
         - Blake gave Thoreau what he most needed: the conviction that he had something to say and an audience to whom he could say it.
      - Daniel Ricketson
         - Contacted Thoreau after reading Walden.
         - Built his own shanty in the woods.
- Thoreau faced a lot of criticism and censorship. It is this community of friends that believed in him and cheered on him that helped him keep going.

*Lesson 4: Be interested about many things and find their interconnections.*

- Combine what doesn't seem to be matched together.
- Thoreau combined poetry, science, literature, and blue-collar work.
- When Channing asked him why he was so endlessly curious about everything, Thoreau answered, “What else is there in life?”
- How did he mishmash his different interests in his work?
   - His interests in language, particularly the language of Native Americans in eastern Massachusetts helped hims understand man’s relationship with Nature.
   - He read scriptures from different religions: Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Christianity. This influenced his social activism.
   - His social activism is where his defense of nature sprang from.
   - He was interested in science and philosophy but he used poetry and poetic language, not academic language, to communicate.
- Thoreau embodied the well-rounded man described by Emerson in his essay “Self-reliance"
   - “A sturdy lad . . . who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not ‘studying a profession,’ for he does not postpone his life, but lives already.”

*Lesson 5: Free your mind.*

- “Any can command him who doth not command himself.”
- Thoreau suffered intellectual bondage in Harvard.
   - Every term for three long years, Edward Tyrrel Channing, the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory, issued Thoreau a long series of assignments, every one of which he collected, corrected, and returned, scored on Quincy’s merciless eight-point scale.
   - If Thoreau kept a journal through these years, it is lost; if he wrote letters home, they are gone; when he ventured into poetry, his verses mostly vanished. What survives are his essays for Channing. They disappoint.
   - Harvard “nearly ruined him as a writer.”
   - Feeling rootless and cut off from the person he had been, Thoreau was confessing anxiety over his new identity as a Harvard graduate and a young man of promise.
   - It was around this time that he changed his name, reversing the baptismal “David Henry” to his preferred “Henry David.”
- How did Thoreau overcame Harvard’s spell?
   - He freed his mind in two ways:
      - Exposure to unconventional mentors.
      - Developing his own ideas in solitude.
   - The process began while he was in Harvard.
      - Because of some financial strain, he applied for a teaching position at the grammar school of Orestes Brownson.
      - He stayed with Brownson’s household (wife and four children).
      - He taught at the grammar school and tutored Brownson’s children.
      - When not working, they would have ferocious conversations.
      - This was Thoreau’s first encounter with a free-range intellectual. His term with Brownson broke the spell of Harvard.
      - Thoreau’s letter to Brownson in 30 December 1837
         - Dear Sir—I have never ceased to look back with interest, not to say satisfaction, upon the short six weeks which I passed with you. They were an era in my life—the morning of a new Lebenstag. They are to me as a dream that is dreamt, but which returns from time to time in all its original freshness.
   - The young and earnest Henry Thoreau learned so well how to write for his teacher in Harvard that it took ten years and a move to Walden Pond to shake himself free.

*Lesson 6: Build a creative process.*

- This is Thoreau’s creative process:
   1. He walked usually in the afternoon.
   2. He took brief field notes.
   3. The following morning, he would expand those notes in his journal.
      - He started journaling at the age of 20 upon Emerson’s encouragement.
   4. Weeks or months later when he is preparing a lecture at the lyceum, he would browse his journal for material and piece them together to create a lecture.
      - He lectured in the Concord Lyceum nearly twenty times in as many years, testing out his ideas before a live audience
      - While delivering the lecture, he would see first-hand the reaction of audiences to what he is saying.
   5. He notes the reactions when he writes the lectures into essays that he sends for publication.
      - The method Thoreau established of developing his writings by watching his words miss or hit home with a living audience stayed with him; behind his pages are the faces of thousands of men and women, often opinionated and always unpredictable, who laughed, argued, and, sometimes, rolled their eyes.
   6. These essays along with more journal entries, in turn, become books.
- He followed the process between the age of 20 until 33.
- Take note: This process was product-centered. What organized his process was the lectures, the essays, and the books that they developed (patterned from Emerson).
- This changed when he underwent a creative transformation in 1850 at 33 years old.
- Create an ecology of your work.
   - At any given point, he has multiple projects going on, different manuscripts in various stages of composition. He worked on each project depending on mood and interest. Each project is interconnected, each finds its unique voice relative to the others and all of them together composed a literary ecology.
      - “You must try a thousand themes before you find the right one—as nature makes a thousand acorns to get one oak.”

*Lesson 7: Dare greatly but be okay with the results.*

- Living in Walden (July 4, 1845-September 6, 1847)
   - “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived."
   - Originally, his move to Walden was just a writer’s retreat, where he can focus on writing.
   - Suddenly, he realized that people were actually noticing him and he had no choice but to turn his move into a performance art.
   - His moved to Walden forced him, an intensely solitary introvert, to devise a public persona that could stand up to all the scrutiny and defend his private self from the glare of publicity.
- Publishing A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers
   - In 1839, when Thoreau was just 22, he went on a boating excursion on Concord and Merrimack rivers with his older brother John.
   - John died in 1842 after cutting himself with a razor and suffering from lockjaw.
   - While living in Walden Pond, aside from writing Walden, he also wrote a book about his excursion with John.
   - He was in love about this book more than Walden. It would be his first book and he hoped that it would launch his career as an author and separate himself from Emerson’s shadow. More importantly, it was his memorial to John.
   - Emerson advised him to publish it whatever the cost.
   - In 1849, 10 years after the excursion, Thoreau published the book. But, only after finding a publisher who agreed to publish it in one condition: Thoreau will pay all publishing costs if the book doesn’t sell.
   - The publisher Munroe only printed the books but did not advertise them and had no distribution network. For Emerson, this will work, but for a new writer, this was disaster.
   - His book sold barely over two hundred copies. The man who took pride in building a house for $28.12½ owed his publisher $290—a year’s ordinary wages. It would take him four years to pay it off, dollar by hard-earned dollar.
   - By fall 1849, it was painfully clear to Thoreau that the book he wrote to prove himself to Emerson had failed to please him. Worse, by following Emerson’s advice to print it no matter the risk, Thoreau precipitated himself into ruinous financial debt.
- Just performing his creative work
   - While walking, people would criticize him.
   - He is criticized for being an Emerson imitator.
   - His words are too radical that he faced censorship many times even by his own publishers, who redacted some of his words without informing him.
      - The result of this was that Thoreau struggled to find his voice. What is astounding is that he never stopped writing.

Lesson 8: Do what feels good.

- Going back home to Concord after a failed attempt to make it as a writer in New York
   - In 1843, about a year after John died, Thoreau had two essays published.
   - Emerson decided that it was time for Thoreau to try to launch a writing career for himself in New York.
   - He moved to Staten Island, in the house of Emerson’s brother, William, to tutor his children
   - He moved to New York City and tried to be like other writers, mobile and market driven. It was a disaster.
   - In his first days there, Thoreau wrote about how amazed he was of the city. But later on, Thoreau got negative feedback both from the career opportunities he has in New York and from himself. He doesn’t like the commercial world.
   - So, he listened to his inner voice. He left New York and decided that if he will be a writer, he will be a different writer, one not embedded in New York but in Concord where he is closer to the natural world.
- Deciding no longer to go to lecture tours.
   - After Walden was published and it became a hit, the next obvious move for Thoreau was to do lectures, and not just the usual lectures in the Concord Lyceum, but lecture tours.
   - He prepared his best materials, but he failed to engage his audience. The audience were expecting him to say something familiar. People yawned at his lectures.
   - Worse, it took away what he treasured above all else, his freedom to walk daily into nature, to see what each new day brought forth. “Winter has come unnoticed by me,” he sulked again, on his return from Providence.
   - He decided that it would be better for him to write books and let his audience be sifted that way. Grand tours worked for Emerson but not for him.
   - He decided to never take a lecture engagement outside New England.

*Lesson 9: Know your most important work.*

- Your most important work is not always what you show the world. Sometimes, it is simply what you do by yourself.
- In 1850, after the failure of his first book, Thoreau find himself in an interesting spot:
   - Free from Emerson’s expectations
   - Free from the literary marketplace
   - Free from all hopes of travel abroad
- He might have realized that no one is actually listening, so might as well, do what I want to do.
- He had a creative awakening that modified his creative process and this all arose from this one realization: the process, not the product, was the reward
- What changed in his creative process?
   1. Walks
      - His walks became longer around 3 or more hours.
      - His walks stop being a diversion from work. They became the work itself.
   2. Field Notes
      - Instead of just random thoughts, he started noting about everything he saw in that day.
   3. Journal
      - The following day, as he expanded his notes in his journal, he would write everything he noticed and thought during his daily walk as one long entry.
      - This meant that his journal entries got longer.
      - He filled pages with a stream-of-consciousness flow of words as if he were writing while walking: “I pluck,” “I heard,” “I saw yesterday,” “I notice.”
      - The date, and what he can write of his life on that one day, is no longer incidental to some larger quest—it is the quest.
- What was different here?
   - Thoreau simply stopped using his Journal as the means to the “real” work of art somewhere else, and started treating the Journal itself as the work of art, with all the integrity that art demands.
      - In this new mode, his Journal volumes were something like scientific notebooks, laboratory records whose value lay precisely in their regularity and completeness.
   - Reorienting his writing required reorienting the pattern of his daily life. Thoreau’s new protocol required a high degree of focus and discipline, for its value depended on consistency: going out every day, and every day pressing language to find something new to see
   - When he went to travel, this was the pattern of he used: focused and intense field trips, taken with purpose in mind and notebook in hand.
   - His Journal still produced books, lectures, essays, and other projects. But the larger vision of Thoreau’s Journal was a deeply personal one born out of his desire to understand reality as a whole.
      - His grand and unifying vision pointed to that deeper, wider reality he’d called “the frame-work of the universe.” When one surveys the dozens of research notebooks, scores of meticulous Journal volumes, the maps and surveys and thousands of pages of natural history notes and unpublished manuscripts, one begins to comprehend the scope of his vision; but to see the full picture, one must also examine the hundreds of books he annotated and the hundreds of charts and graphs where he pooled and organized his growing data. It was a staggeringly ambitious vision—impossible, really—but Thoreau embarked on it with ferocious energy. Nearly all of this activity dates from 1850.
- Thoreau started living two lives
   1. Visible
      - Busy town surveyor, village naturalist, active lecturer, and publishing writer, who helped out in the family business.
         - He was not longer going after the big goal like Emerson’s and Emerson criticized him for this.
            - “I cannot help counting it a fault in him that he had no ambition. Wanting this, instead of engineering for all America, he was the captain of a huckleberry party."
   2. Hidden
      - Breathtaking ambitious intellectual feats that are far greater than Emerson’s. All hidden in Thoreau’s journal.
      - Emerson only found out about this after Thoreau’s death and he pointed this out in his eulogy for his friend.
- "Here I am thirty-four years old, and yet my life is almost wholly unexpanded. How much is in the germ! There is such an interval between my ideal and the actual in many instances that I may say I am unborn. There is the instinct for society, but no society. Life is not long enough for one success. Within another thirty-four years that miracle can hardly take place. Methinks my seasons revolve more slowly than those of nature; I am differently timed. I am contented. This rapid revolution of nature, even of nature in me, why should it hurry me? Let a man step to the music which he hears, however measured.” - Journal, 19 July 1851
