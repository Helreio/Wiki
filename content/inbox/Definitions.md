# Definitions

Core Desired Mental States - these are the ultimate descriptions of what you want. They describe what your mind is at when you have achieved what you want.

Core Values - these are a different way of expressing your core desired mental states. Values are CDMS expressed as things you care about.

Standards - these are things you also want (and, therefore, also descriptions of mental states, but they could also describe physical states). However, they are desired states only because they are instrumental to fulfill your CDMS. Standards are things you want to maintain through projects and habits for a particular area of responsibility to be in good shape.

Area of Responsibility - a sphere of activity made up of projects and habits with a standard to be maintained over time.

Habits - these are actions you perform repeatedly ideally to maintain a standard in an area of responsibility.

Goals - these are similar to standards as they are also descriptions of mental and physical states that are desired to fulfill your CDMS. What makes them different from standards is that they are pursued once and end.

Projects - these are a collection of actions that accomplish a particular goal with a deadline.

Actions - these are things you do to pursue desired states.

In order to achieve a goal, you need both:

- commitment (I want this.)
- confidence (I can do this.)

Linking values with goals creates resilience.

Steps in goal-setting

1. Commit to a set of core values.
2. Set goals aligned to your core values.
3. Align your actions or pathways towards your goals using your character strengths.
4. Constantly review, persist, and course correct.
