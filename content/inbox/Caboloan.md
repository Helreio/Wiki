There is one mountain. That is where the main gathering place "panagdagupan" is located.

Houses are afar from each other.

Around two hectares for a household.

There are more forests than rice paddies.

There are families who are hunters. There are families who are farmers. And there are families who are fishermen. Each family is given freedom to choose.

But at this time, more families are skeptical of farming. Most choose to stay as fishermen and hunters.
