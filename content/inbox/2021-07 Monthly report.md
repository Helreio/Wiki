# 2021-07 Monthly report

# Summary

This month, I started reading the book Finding Your Voice by Les Edgerton. I was able to experiment with several exercises and I am starting to get a better image of the kind of writing I enjoy. I want to write autobiographical, research-based, philosophical, and practical writings in a sincere and earnest voice and not in a voice of an authoritative self-help guru or coach. I also spent a big chunk of this month studying photography. I finished the iPhone photography school and I was able to apply what I learned in real-world scenarios: portrait photography with Rem and Claire, and documenting two Hugpungans and Diwa’s clearing. After I shared my documentation to others, I heard really good feedback from people, and I realize it feels good to share photos and see people have fun looking at them. Aside from photography, I also tried taking binaural videos this month, and that is possible because I already have a tripod. The visual elements of my work definitely got better, and my walks have been more interesting than ever, especially because I am also uncovering new ideas and preferences about how I walk. Meanwhile, I felt like I wanted to go back to doing more research, and optimizing my life system, and so I decided to change the format of Lilim and start a new season using that format. Nevertheless, I experienced my second big loss this year this month (in two consecutive months). At the end of the month, I went through a period of grief after losing Doji. This persuaded me to seriously plan going home, which the new lockdown prevented from happening. I called back home instead and had a really fun conversation with my parents. I also want to mention that, this month, my efforts to find justice regarding my phone has peaked. The NBI is not as accomodating and helpful as the DTI. I am starting to accept this lost and move forward. I am feeling like I have done enough, and it’s okay to finally let go.
