# Photo/Drawing → Vignette → Poem

Try this process in writing [[thoughts/poetry]]:

1. Draw a visual sketch of the poem (alternatively, take a picture).
2. Write a short prose description of the sketch or picture (if you can write an entire [[inbox/Vignette]], better). Write this with the intention of using it as a prompt for a poem.
3. Using the prose as prompt, write the poem.
