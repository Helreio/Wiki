# The other creatures are strong, but what differentiates men from them is their intelligence. They are able to sing the song.

The other creatures have a measure of intelligence too but are not able to live in complex ilis, thus are overpowered by men.

But, will it be possible that there will be a species that is completely beyond men? Is it possible for evolution to move further in my fictional universe, thus creating the next tragedies.
