Emotions are fleeting. The goal is therefore not to stay on a positive emotion continuously. It might not be possible. It seems more natural to jump from an emotion to the other. If this is the case, the goal is therefore to generate more positive emotions. This is achieved by two ways

1. Cultivating habits that generate positive emotions more consistently.
2. Pursuing one-time projects that make it easier to generate more positive emotions more consistently.

And for negative emotions, we need to cultivate mindfulness and presence while experiencing them and then resilience after experiencing them.
