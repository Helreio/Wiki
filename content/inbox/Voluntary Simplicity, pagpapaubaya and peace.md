# Voluntary Simplicity, pagpapaubaya and peace

Define the minimum amount that you need.

What you need, protect for your survival.

If you can give it away to the detriment of your survival, you are making it out of free will.

What you don't need, give it away, let others use it.

What you don't need, you don't have to protect.

When you protect something you don't need for another person, you are converting it into your need to, otherwise you shouldnt mingle.

Let the two persons involved, settle their dispute.

Pagpapaubaya, means you are giving up what you think you need, and yet dont really need. Because u understand what u only need.
