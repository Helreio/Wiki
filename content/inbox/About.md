# About

Hi I'm Vince. I'm just trying to live a good life. But I got caught up into so much other interests.

When I was 19, I left my childhood religion. This left a large void in my life. To fill that void, I decided to build my own life philosophy. Along the way, I realized I needed something more than a life philosophy. I needed a comprehensive life management system, where life philosophy is just one part of it.

I currently have a minimum viable life management system in place, but I'm still looking for ways to improve it. More importantly, I am studying theoretical explanations behind such a system and its connection to what it means to live a good life.

Meanwhile, this life management system has allowed me to pursue other interests such as poetry, creative writing, photography, videography, translation, etc.

Hi, I’m Vince. I’m a writer who likes to walk, think, and feel. I have a strong feeling that the combination of these three makes for a fulfilling life—at least for me.

This website is what I like to call a “convergence tool”—a platform to make sense of the scattered interests I have been exploring through the years.

I change lots of these.

Right now, I am strognly called to think deeply about the question “How should I live?” My thought process is demonstrated by a personal note-writing system I call Talahardin (garden of notes). It is where I do my thinking and most of my writing right now. From it, more detailed articles and documentations emerge. I will be treating this website like a wiki—a collection of knowledge I collect from living and research.

Aside from thinking, I like to take walks, really long walks. That is where I get most of my thoughts. Here is a list of my walk narratives so far.

Other projects you might want to explore:

- Translations
- Poetry
- Pangasinan
