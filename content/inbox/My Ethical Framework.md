# My Ethical Framework

Why biocentrism instead of anthropocentrism?

**Other things have consciousness**

Because I am in the state of I don’t know whenever I get out of my own conscious awareness.

I cannot know directly whether or not other minds exist. But my intuition tells me they do.

I believe that human beings do not have the exclusivity of conscious awareness. I think animals have a measure of it because I am able to create a relationship with them. Plants, there might be evidence that they too have some measure of mind. Nonliving things, it might take a while for me to believe on that.

But this metaphysical condition, I am persuaded to believe that indeed, consciousness is in things outside of the human mind.

**I am interconnected with other things**

Whether there exist a single substance, two, or multiple, what is true is that there is “interconnection”. Boundaries are not so clear. Interaction is the name of the game.

I am interconnected with other things in a degree that I may not totally realize. But I am persuaded to believe that the connection and dependence is strong. It might be metaphysically fundamental. For any existent thing with life, interdependence is inevitable. Or it can be argued that even when there’s no life, interdependence is inevitable.

Although individuals are the fundamental units, relationship is also fundamental. What we learn from Gaia theory for example shows that the whole is interconnected that the demise of it leads to demise of individuals.

This interconnection could be explained in darwinian terms. I need to respect it in order to survive.

Also, if there is no self, and what exists is a bigger self instead, then to take care of the bigger self is survival.

The existence of self

**Ethical Deductions**

Given that other nonhuman things have consciousness and that I am interconnected with them in a fundamental way, I could create an ethical framework where it becomes my duty to take care of the world.

The selfish argument will be it is for my own benefit to do so.
