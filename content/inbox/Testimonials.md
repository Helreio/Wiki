“In a world that can feel too fast-paced, Vince’s writing has helped me slow down, reflect, and be more mindful of the present. He has the ability to take me into his world through his writing, as if I am right there with him, appreciating the beauty of nature and people.

Writer

“I have been receiving emails from Vince Imbat for some time and I have always enjoyed his messages of discovery. He is such a generous sharer and his adventures in reading and writing (on spirituality, creativity, philosophy, and wellness) are something that I often follow because there are always interesting gems that may be gained from his writings: information, leads, insights, and inspiration. As a writer, Vince is devoted and sincere—two great qualities that any writer worth reading should definitely possess.”

“Vince writes with a straightforward yet personal style, and his content has a minimalistic and a sort of independent scholar tone— accessible, sensible, and intelligent. It is here that his dedication to writing, blogging, poetry, and translation is strikingly evident.”

“Vince seems very inspired in what he does and he is good at it. Vince goes through a process each time he completes his work, but I am not certain if he is aware that he transfers the same process to me and his followers/subscribers. I look at the picture, read the text, travel back in time, feel the emotion/s, reflect, put down my device, be silent, be inspired, tap the like/reaction button, and write a comment at times.

Just like each day that I look for the maroon coffee mug on a plate on the breakfast table, Vince’s works affect me in the same way. I look for posts that he shares each day.

Vince Imbat is an essayist, a reader, a poet, a writer, an editor, and a doodlist, but that is not all that he does. He will also make you laugh and will make you his friend. Discover his written works, find yourself in them, be inspired, and enjoy the journey.”

Coach at Candent Learning Haus

“Vince Imbat’s ability to translate to Pilipino the articles written in English by Thoreau speaks of fluency not only in both languages but also in the presence of a mind endowed with a keen understanding of Nature, Beauty and the Spirit that guides expression. In his choice of topics, Vince Imbat shares dimensions apart from what a common man gets, and bridges the gaps that run through time. When modern age writers could connect respected and writers of note with other writers and readers, there is a need for the heart. Vince Imbat is a writer who brings clarity of words that show the art that lies in writers’ hearts.”

Homoeopathy seminar trainer/facilitator, writer-editor

“From the deeply philosophical and spiritual to the funny and unabashedly irreverent, Vince’s writing effectively takes you to the world he creates with his words. He ponders on life questions and translates Henry David Thoreau’s musings one day, and does a witty celebrity impression in his poem the next. Whatever the subject, Vince’s writing is always refreshing to read.”

Writer and story facilitator

“I have been reading Vince’s posts for quite some time now and his writings (and other recent creations) are always a source of new ideas and inspiration for me to reflect and be grateful especially for the simple things in life. His advocacy for sustainable living by being less dependent on money is one concrete example I am inclined to follow.”

Psychology intern

“One of the books of John Izzo that I read said, ‘Have you ever wanted to sit down with someone who is really wise and ask him or her some fundamental questions about life?’ This is one of the many reasons why I have been following “Vincent Life’s work”. A generous and honest window to his journey in understanding and living this life. Thanks, Vince—reading your work always reminds me to pause and live my life with meaning and presence.”
