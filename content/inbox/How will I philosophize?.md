# How will I philosophize?

1. I need to find the right place for inarticulate knowledge, beauty, and contents of the mind that escape words.
2. Once the use of such things are clearly defined, I need to determine their relationship with abstract reasoning. Are they more primordial? Are they simply supplementary?
3. Only when I have articulated how I will use them will I create a regimen that develops abstract reasoning and contemplation together in unison.
