# Incorporate signature strengths to daily routine

There is so much beauty in the world. I want to focus on that. I want to look at the good side. I have a very small time on earth. I want to spend it to what’s really important to me—appreciating beauty and excellence, building wisdom, learning lots of things, and expressing gratitude every day. I need to incorporate my signature strengths to my daily routine.
