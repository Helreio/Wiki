# An individual experiment in intentional living

The work that I want to do is personal developmentâ€”a combination of practical philosophy, psychology, health, and spirituality.

I want to get to know myself better, feel good, and increase my wisdom. I want to live a healthy life.

Mine is an individual experiment in intentional living.
