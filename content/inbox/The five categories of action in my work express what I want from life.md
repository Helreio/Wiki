# The five categories of action in my work express what I want from life

I want a life of intellectual exploration.

I want a life of Ginhawa as experienced moment by moment in everything that I do.

I want a life of self-expression. I want to be seen and to help people through my self, my story.

I want a life where I touch individual lives and facilitate change within them.

I want a life of genuine and fulfilling connections that help me flourish.
