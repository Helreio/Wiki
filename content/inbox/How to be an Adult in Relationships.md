# How to be an Adult in Relationships

**FOREWORD**

Mindfulness + Lovingkindness = awareness, joy, and deep relating.

**Mindfulness**

Mindfulness is an ancient meditation mode in which we let go of our fears, our attachments to control and being right, our expectations and entitlements, and our judgments of others. Instead of these popular strategies, we learn to simply stay present openly in the moment—with nothing in the way—so we can experience life as it occurs. When we apply mindfulness to our relationships, we can finally see ourselves and others as we are, in all our touching vulnerability and with all our rich potential for love.

**Lovingkindness**

In the spiritual practice of lovingkindness, we expand our awareness of others in an immensely tender and caring way. We journey beyond our own personal relationships and embrace the wider world. We learn to extend our love to everyone around us, even those to whom we are indifferent and those we find difficult. Through lovingkindness the romantic union between two people ultimately embraces the world.

**INTRODUCTION**

**The Five A's**

We feel loved when we receive attention, acceptance, appreciation, and affection, and when we are allowed the freedom to live in accord with our own deepest needs and wishes. These “five A’s” meet us in different guises throughout life’s journey.

**Building Self = Building Relationships**

Human experience has a striking and reliable harmony: What we need for the building of a self is also precisely what we need for happiness in our adult love relationships.

**Intimacy = Giving and Receiving the Five A's**

Intimacy, at its best, means giving and receiving the five A’s, the joys and wealth of relationship.

**Loving should be Effortless**

The Five A’s are not results of effort. They are the automatic overflow of the love that we receive. We do not have to try; we simply notice that we are attentive, appreciative, etc., toward those we love. The same applies to compassion. It is a spiritual gift, a grace bestowed on us as a result of mindfulness practice. It is not a task. We notice that compassion happens in and through us as we become more mindfully present in the world.

**How to Increase Your Capacity to Love**

Is there a way to increase our capacity to give and receive these essential elements of love? Yes, we can do it through mindfulness, an alert witnessing of reality without judgment, attachment, fear, expectation, defensiveness, bias, or control. Through compassionate mindfulness we become adept at granting the essential components of love to everyone—even to ourselves.

**Why Couples Should Have a Spiritual Practice Together**

Couples with a spiritual practice have a greater serenity in their life together and increase their chances for happiness and longevity in their relationships.

**CHAPTER ONE: HOW IT ALL BEGAN**

**The Power of Love**

Love from another adult does more than just satisfy us in the present. It ripples back in time for us, repairing, restoring, and renovating an inadequate past. Sincere love also sets off a forward-moving ripple and a resultant shift inside us.

**The Capacity to Love Intimately**

We get to the point where we can think: “Now I don’t have to need quite so much. Now I don’t have to blame my parents quite so much. Now I can receive love without craving more and more. I can have and be enough.” Only the person whose journey has progressed to that point can love someone intimately.

**Who Are Those Who Love Us?**

Those who love us understand us and are available to us with an attention, appreciation, acceptance, and affection we can feel. They make room for us to be who we are.

**The Healthy Ego vs. The Neurotic Ego**

Our work, then, is to become the healthiest possible version of who we uniquely are. The healthy ego—what Freud called “a coherent organization of mental processes”—is the part of us that can observe self, situations, and persons; assess them; and respond in such a way as to move toward our goals. We do not let go of this aspect of ego but build on it. It assists us in relationships by making us responsible and sensible in our choices and commitments. The neurotic ego, on the other hand, is the part of us that is compulsively driven or stymied by fear or desire, feeding arrogance, entitlement, attachment, and the need to control other people. Sometimes it is self-negating and makes us feel we are victims of others. This neurotic ego is the one we are meant to dismantle as our spiritual task in life. Its tyrannies frighten intimacy away and menace our self-esteem.

**Embrace the Process Toward a Healthy Ego**

A healthy person is not perfect but perfectible, not a done deal but a work in progress. Staying healthy takes discipline, work, and patience, which is why our life is a journey and perforce a heroic one. The neurotic ego wants to follow the path of least resistance. The spiritual Self wants to reveal new paths. It is not that practice makes perfect but that practice is perfect, combining effort with an openness to grace.
