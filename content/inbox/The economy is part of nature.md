# The economy is part of nature

The economy is part of nature because it is a system that emerged out of it through [[Spontaneous order]].

Therefore, it is only reasonable to work with it and not against it. In fact, we might say that the economy is necessary for human freedom. It doesn’t have to be interpreted as an evil force.

It is an extension of Nature, and like it, it is neutral. It is simply exchange taken to an entirely different level brought by human consciousness. The economy is simply an aggregate of tiny choices that humans make about living a good life—tiny choices that reflects their hopes and dreams for themselves and those they love. These tiny expressions of hopes and desires create this massive entity that can both be violent and benevolent.
