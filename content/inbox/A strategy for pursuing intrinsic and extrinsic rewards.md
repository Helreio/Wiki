# A strategy for pursuing intrinsic and extrinsic rewards

An optimal strategy for pursuing creative and meaninful work is to not overly rely on extrinsic rewards. Instead, make intrinsic rewards the foundation of oneâ€™s creative practice, and when one is ready and more resilient, then and only then, should one pursue extrinsic rewards, which also have benefits ([[Why does one opt to live in public?]])

A more complete creative life is one that has both. However, if one chooses to only pursue intrinsic rewards, one would be better off than if one pursues extrinsic rewards alone.
