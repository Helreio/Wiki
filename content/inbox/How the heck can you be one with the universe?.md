# How the heck can you be one with the universe?

Here’s their methodological claim: you can arrive at “truth” by abandoning reasoning and language altogether. Reasoning and language are constructed by humans – why should we think they result in the discovery of truth? There is in fact, they argue, a more fundamental truth, accessible to every person regardless of mental capacity: you exist. Not only do you exist, but _everything_exists. **This is key**. Everything in the universe exists. Hence, “you” are part of everything.

If we mesh this with a theory of atoms, you are made up of the exact same stuff as every other thing which exists – you are just arranged differently.

you don’t need to use left-brained reasoning to understand this as a proper sentence/proposition. You just exist. Indeed, if you abandon language, you still exist. If you abandon your goals and even your beliefs, you exist, just like everything else in the universe. Just “be”.

In fact, acting with “goals” to “succeed in life” or get ahead in some material way is also pointless. Again, all artificial. A proper life is one lived by understand that you are part of “one”, and not getting caught up in what some culture throws at you and tells you is important. Furthermore, even what you consider your “self” is artificial – your beliefs, goals, attitudes, AKA your “ego”. Only upon abandoning your self, your ego, can you attain a state of “nirvana” or pure one-ness with the universe.

The question remains one of methodology. Perhaps the methodology of the East and the West can ironically be two sides of the same coin – ways of finding absolute truth. I don’t think rational analysis should be given up just because another methodology might arise, especially if that methodology has severe limitations. Yes, I think is it valid to say that by abandoning language, you can still arrive at a truth: that you exist. However, just because everything shares a common property (existence), does not mean everything is the same thing.

But just because you can arrive at *a* truth, does not mean you have arrived at *all* truths or the “ultimate” truth (if such a thing exists)

I think it is accurate to try to reject artificial constructions, at least as it relates to your beliefs about yourself. I think culture is deceitful and empty. However, just because it might be wise to not completely devote your life to becoming wealthy in an attempt to find happiness, it does not follow that you have to entirely reject a career or life-goals. The ultimate reason for living should not be to fulfill some arbitrary role that society has given you, but that does not mean you should not have any role. (Of course, I believe this should be discovering what truth is. Let’s not kid ourselves into thinking our lives matter unless we’ve done enough research to confidently conclude either way. This journey takes precedence, necessarily, over anything else.)

Why not mesh these two worldviews, in the ways in which they are not mutually exclusive. While the West is typically dogmatic in its physicalist empiricism, the East tends to be dogmatic in its various versions of spiritualism/mysticism (to the point of rejecting Reason altogether). Why not take the middle road? Perhaps Dualism best explains the world, both as a philosophy of mind (both mental phenomena and physical phenomena exist), and as methodological Dualism: you can know certain truths through different methodologies. You exist, and you can either think about that rationally, or just “be”.

if you want to get beyond the simple truth that you exist, I would recommend *not* abandoning logical, linguistic reasoning. There are an enormous number of truths to discover with your mind, if you go about it [the](http://onefreemind.com/2011/09/why-reason-comes-first/)[right](http://onefreemind.com/2011/04/the-secret-to-finding-truth-part-2/) [way](http://onefreemind.com/2012/01/how-to-understand/).
