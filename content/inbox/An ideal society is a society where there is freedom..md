# An ideal society is a society where there is freedom.

But of course, even that is a value statement.

There really is no objectivity here.

And so I understand the many people, who appeal to metaphysical claims for their value statements.

However, there is but one true metaphysical and epistemological claim. It is necessary by logic.

And if part of that metaphysical story is the story that we are not bonded to take a particular course of action, and that there is free will, then we could inform our choice of actions using these truths.
