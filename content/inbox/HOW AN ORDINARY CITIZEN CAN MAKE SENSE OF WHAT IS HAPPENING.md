# HOW AN ORDINARY CITIZEN CAN MAKE SENSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING

With too much to do, we dont have time to look at research, to do our own fact-finding. Therefore, a natural heuristic is to ask ourselves, who will I trust?

The easiest answer to the question is to trust someone who is more knowledgeable about the said issue. The first people to come to mind are the authorities. They do the work we dont have to do. And to trust them is an understandable impulse.

But what we know, and we just have to be reminded of this, is that experts are fallible and that fallibility creeps through all institutions of society so easily. So much that while trust on experts is a natural impulse, I would argue that a distrust to authority is also a viable heuristic on situations when we are so powerless or data is inaccessbile.

My argument is that, an ordinary citizen who is not skilled in looking at data and who does not have access to that in the first place will either trust authorities or distrust them. We should allow both to happen because its what the powerless can do.

Many of us have been wronged by medical experts, academic, politicians. An interesting phenomenon is that, despite these past wrongs, we still go back to them when fear strikes. And yet

I encourage everyone to look at the evidences as deeply as we can. But if that is not possible, act according to what you currently know and not simply act according to what the majority says or what authorities says because its easy. If authorities have repeatedly wronged you, what merit do they have for you to trust them today as an exeption?
