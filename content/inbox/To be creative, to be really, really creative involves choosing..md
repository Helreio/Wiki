# To be creative, to be really, really creative involves choosing.

Choosing creativity over working for survival.

And choosing creativity the desire to just have a good time.

Creativity lies in an entirely different plane compared to our more primitive motivations: survival and pleasure.

While it is possible to connect creativity to either and make it something that aids our survival and something that brings us pleasure, it isn't always the case, especially at first

Creativity requires work, effort, psychological energies that are less older than our more biological urges. Therefore, when we confront it at its purest form, we need discipline. Or use hacks to make it easier to do.
