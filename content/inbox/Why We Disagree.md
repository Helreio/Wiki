Reasons Why We Disagree

1. We donâ€™t agree is we have different beliefs on what foundations are and if even we need them.
2. Then, between our foundations and our conclusions are thousands if not millions of premises about the world and how we should live in it.
3. We also disagree on the conclusions of our premises because they mix with countless other premises.
4. We disagree with the connections,the additional premises, between our conclusions and actions.
5. We disagree on the results of our actions and what best actions to take in the future.
