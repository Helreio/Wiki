# It is impossible to arrive to true conclusions using flawed foundations

Wrong foundations lead to wrong premises and wrong conclusions. Therefore, a worldview that uses wrong foundations is wrong. [[Discard a worldview with a mistaken foundation]].

Arriving at true conclusions using wrong foundations is like winning a chess game against a Grandmaster without even understanding the rules. It’s possible, but you’ll probably lose in about ten moves.
