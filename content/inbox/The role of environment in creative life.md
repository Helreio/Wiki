# The role of environment in creative life

While the practice itself, the hardwork, is something that shouldn't be undermined, we shouldnt also forget about the environment, its influence on the creative process (making it more difficult or easier)

- the space where the creative lives
- Where he works
- His friends
- His community
- The media he consumes

These are all as powerful as what happens when the creative decides to speak.

It influences the experience of creating and the creative life in general which encompasses all of these.

What you are actually doing when you are building your community, relocating, managing what you consume, improving your health, is building the foundation for creative life to happen.

But creativity is also part of the infrastructure that makes all the other things easier.

Where will I expand?

- Being with beauty and excellence
