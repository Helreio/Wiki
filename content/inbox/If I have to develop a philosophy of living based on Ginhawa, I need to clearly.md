# If I have to develop a philosophy of living based on Ginhawa, I need to clearly

If I have to develop a philosophy of living based on Ginhawa, I need to clearly define what I mean.

Is it a feeling?

Consciousness?

Will it come and go or will it stay?

Am I in a position to describe this if I never had a kensho?
