# A worldview is like a tree

A good metaphor for a worldview is a tree:

- Leaves are conclusions.
- Branches are premises.
- The trunk are deeper premises.
- Roots are foundational premises.

Conclusions are stuck to premises. Premises are stuck to deeper premises. Deeper premises grow out of foundational premises.

From a bird’s eye view, leaves, when dense, hide the branches, trunk, and roots of a tree. Conclusions can also hide premises and foundations. It’s important to see past the conclusions to see the premises and foundations.

Interestingly, [[The root word for both truth and tree is the same]].

For a similar metaphor see: [[A worldview is like a house]].
