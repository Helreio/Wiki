# There are three rules of logic and unless i see a satisfactory argument against

There are three rules of logic and unless i see a satisfactory argument against them i will be holding them true, the core filter to what we should believe to be true.

The 3 rules imply that

- Infinities do not exist
- There are no real paradoxes
- The universe has a beginning and an end
- Pluralism
- Nihilism

Some of its implications are difficult for me to accept but I rationally believe them because of the 3 rules
