# Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant

You need to get over the personalization (blaming yourself for what happened).

You need to forgive yourself for what happened.

Positive psychology

Resilience

- How to build strength when the worst things happen

You need to let the grief unfold.

Think about if things got worse.

- This will help you feel better.
- This will make u feel gratitude that you are better.

How are you today?

How we spend our days is how we spend our lives

It is not the intensity of positive moments which makes you happier.

It is the FREQUENCY of these moments.

Create daily moments of joy.

Dont wait to feel better.

Do things that will make you feel happy.

Resilience builds wisdom (imprint of a life on the lives of others).

Post-traumatic growth

You grow from trauma because of strengthening, gratitude, etc.
