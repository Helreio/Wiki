# Religion Could Divide Families

It’s a sad story...how religion could divide families.

If there’s anything a belief to an invisible Being should inspire people to do, that is to bring them together. Not rip them apart.

I used to believe that adherence to certain religious principles could make people better communicators, could make people closer to each other.
