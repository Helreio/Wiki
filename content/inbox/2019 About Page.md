# 2019 About Page

Hi there, I’m Vince Imbat.

Welcome to my digital home. Here, I publish stuff about philosophy, healing, flourishing, and economics. Some days, I also share my poetry and photography.

Chronology

Here are a few things about my past:

In 2011, I went through a major depressive episode and was put under psychiatric medications. After seven years of healing, I’m only taking one drug (sertraline) right now and I’m seriously thinking about getting off it for good.

Going through depression changed my perspective on many things, one of which is my views on religion and spirituality. I left my childhood religion in 2012 and see it as one of the best decisions I ever did. Today, I don’t go to any church and I don’t see myself being part of any in the foreseeable future.

After finishing college in 2013, I realized I didn’t want to be boxed inside a traditional career path. So, I started freelancing instead—I worked less, spent little, and used most of my time pursuing my different interests.

Now

At the moment, here are my priorities:

I’m fully committed to a morning mindfulness practice which involves yoga, journaling, reflective reading, and meditation.

I’m exploring the world of ideas through philosophy with the intention of coming up with a good answer to the question: “How should I live my life?”

I take long walks or bike rides in the morning and in the afternoon because my best ideas visit me when I’m outdoors.

I’m working on getting completely off sertraline. This goal involves doing a lot of research, reaching out to supportive communities, and establishing alternative coping strategies.

I continue to transform my relationship with money, the market economy, and the larger material world. My intention is to create an efficient personal economic existence that maximizes my autonomy. I’m reducing waste and unnecessary expenses in my life. Also, I try to learn various skills that lessen my dependence on money.

I’m continuously enriching my life through studying, art, and adventure.
