# Paul Jarvis’ investment strategy

Paul only invests what money is left after his expenses in an entire month. He only does passive investing. He does not trade.

He does believe that we should pay all high-interest debts and save up for an emergency fund first before investing. He only invests using ETFs for low risk and easy management.

He believes it is never too late to start investing, because no matter how big your money is, it doubles in every 10 years. He also believes there is no amount too small to start.

He believes that your investing should be automatic so that you will never spend the money. Setting and forgetting is how one grows one’s money.
