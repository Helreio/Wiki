# Celebrating Obscurity

There are two ways that people look at creativity

1. A celebrity game
2. An authenticity game

Neither are right or wrong. People who look at creativity in each lens are looking at it the right way.

However, we have a cultural bias that favors the first option

- If you are a writer you need to get published
- If you are a poet you need to get published
- Win an award
- Be recognized
- Have x number of followers
- Earn x number of income from royalties

Again there is nothing wrong about all these goals. But we have to recognize that there exists a cultural bias over these goals, which have not always resulted to good things.

Some examples:

- People expect creatives to be have a following. If they don’t have one, they’re just “hobbyists”, which is synonymous to being failures.
- Because society expects people to have a following when they call themselves artists, many who have a creative itch are frightened by the creative process
- People leave their creative endeavors because after burning out from trying so hard to “make it”.
- Many creatives sacrifice other important areas of their lives for the sake of "success"
- Society distinguishes between good art (which is usually “high art) and bad art (doodles, punk art, etc.)
- Creativity is institutionalized and pigeonholed into hierarchies
- The creative marketplace has transformed into a dog-eat-dog environment where you either make it or you die (sometimes, literally)

Much of society’s idea of what creativity and art is revolves around the celebrity game. If you are an artist and you play the celebrity game, you have to face some hard facts:

1. People’s attention have become more and more scarce over the years thanks to the Internet and social media, which made the barrier to entry to content creation so low.
2. Winning the celebrity game almost always requires you to compete. You have no choice about this.
3. In particular instances, you can make it by playing the authenticity game but we shouldn’t forget the role of “luck” in these instances. Making it in the creative world just by being authentic is not the norm (for more discussion on this, see the work of Nicholas Taleb).

The alternative of the celebrity game is of course the authenticity game.

What is the authenticity game?

- Aspire for authenticity first
- Aspire for doing what feels good
- Stop treating your art as the be all and end all of your life
- Prepare for mild success (i.e., doing your work well based on your own standards, not that of other people, and training yourself to be ready when “luck” works for you and you get a break)
- When a celebrity opportunity arrives, remembere to reflect on the cons not just the pros

Celebrate obscurity

I believe there are some benefits from obscurity. Austin Kleon said in Steal Like an Artist:

“Soon after, you learn that most of the world doesn’t necessarily care about what you think. It sounds harsh, but it’s true. As the writer Steven Pressfield says, “It’s not that people are mean or cruel, they’re just busy.

This is actually a good thing, because you want attention only after you’re doing really good work. There’s no pressure when you’re unknown. You can do what you want. Experiment. Do things just for the fun of it. When you’re unknown, there’s nothing to distract you from getting better. No public image to manage. No huge paycheck on the line. No stockholders. No e-mails from your agent. No hangers-on.

You’ll never get that freedom back again once people start paying you attention, and especially not once they start paying you money.

Enjoy your obscurity while it lasts. Use it.”

This is where I admire Thoreau so much. Yes, he was able to make a name for himself while he was alive but he was never a big hit like the big names in literature. And even when he started gaining traction in writing books and lecturing, he recognized the tension between fame and his desire to be authentic in the work that he does. For example, he stopped giving lectures when he noticed that people were just looking for a formulaic presentation. Also, his nature observations in his journal was his most important work but he never really intended to share this to others at least when he was alive.

I’m sure there are other examples of artists who played the authenticity game rather than the celebrity game.
