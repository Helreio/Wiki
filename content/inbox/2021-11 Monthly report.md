# 2021-11 Monthly report

# Summary

This month, I continued to deepen my relationship with Lea and contemplate a life with her. I brought her to Pangasinan for the first time. We spent two nights in Dagupan, where I shared good food, walks, and memories with her. Then we went to Cablong where I introduced her to my parents. It felt good to see her interact with my parents and sibling for the first time. I felt that my family were supportive of my choice. It feels good that my family is supporting each other in some way. They helped me with this and I reciprocate by agreeing to pay for Mama’s meds and giving the Macbook Air to Bernice officially. Lea and I had great conversations this month—the walk at UP, the sharing about spirituality, revisiting the vaccination issue. As I continued building my relationship with her, so is my relationship with her mom and family. I spent a few moments with friends this month, but most of my social times were spent with Lea and our families. Meanwhile, I dealt with some challenges like talking to Lea about vaccination again and dealing with the flea problem at home. Nevertheless, I was able to continue improving my Talahardin by pruning underdeveloped notes and putting them back to the Inbox. I also realized the right direction for this project: get familiar with Zettelkasten and Evergreen note-writing then developed my personal system. I also made progress training Nics to be an editor. And I was able to improve my workstation, spending some cash on a monitor and a standing desk. I also cleaned the house really thoroughly. I was able to discover a few new roads in Sta. Barbara, the irrigation road behind Balon Kalsada and the road from Botao to Matic-matic. I didn’t create much this month and that is okay. The rest from showing up to the world has given me a much needed perspective in assessing my next steps in life.
