# Pulog Street

Quietness: 4/5

Best time to walk: Late afternoon

This street has a view of Makiling. It has relatively more trees than nearby streets. But most of these trees are ornamentals. Houses in this street are quite larger and lawns are wider suggesting well-off people live here. It also has a steep part at the end. The street leads to a dead-end so the only way back is where you came from. I really like the feeling of going down this street.

Community animals are few. I only remember one dog let lose by his owner and one or two cats on the street.
