# On Square One

S is using an assumption that some things exist outside of his conception. But he says that he doesn’t know for certainty.

His logic is coming from an assumption that things are “separate” and “distinct” from each other in face value.

That there is no other level of reality.

Logic only works that way.

The assumption that things exist outside the mind is the foundation of his reasoning. And yet he will not discuss it?

But if we assume that there is a separate level of existence (not one but two) then the rules of logic governed by the assumption of separation will have to break down

Separation is built in language. So to embrace language is to embrace separation. What if things are not really separated? That there are no boundaries?

To claim that there is Gaia is to believe that there is non-Gaia. What if there are no opposites?
