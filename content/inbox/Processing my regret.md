# Processing my regret

I regret our first cuckolding experience. We made several mistakes: wrong guy, solo date, short videos, didn’t take things slowly.

I regret it because I was hurt. I felt anxiety, stress, jealousy, and feeling left out. It disrupted my daily life for more than two weeks. If I knew I would feel all of these, I would’t have done it. I regret that we didn’t educate ourselves enough before acting on it.

Sex is something that binded you and Lea constantly. You followed your instincts with decisions about sex. You don’t have a sexual mentor. You and Lea just followed yourselves. You felt very excited because you have a very attractive partner, who was also a very sexual being, and who accepted your kink. Before it happened, you have been encouraging her to reach out to men. The event with Seb made both of you frustrated. This built up more tension and strengthened both of your desires to make this happen. Up until now, you haven’t really analyzed your sexuality. You didn’t even realize that your past including your porn viewing behaviors may have had an effect on your sexuality. You didn’t consider sexuality as something you research first before acting on it. You don’t have parents, family members, or friends to guide you about these things. It was inevitable that you will learn this by yourself, and it was highly plausible that you will learn this through a mistake, which was what happened.

If I was in a similar situation in the future, I will neverl let my emotions get ahead of me. First, I and Lea will have talked about this fetish many times by then, exploring our preferences about it.  We will not act on it when we haven’t done our homework. We have an answer to the question of whether this will be a lifestyle, a one-time experiment, or something in between. We will not think of acting on our fantasies if we know that it is better to keep it a fantasy for now. If ever we come to the conclusion that we want to act on it, we will take things slowly—chats first, then webcam (if we’re ready), then threesome, then solo dates. We will not just choose any random dude. We will find someone who really understands what it means to be a bull, who agrees to record on video, who will use condom unless he is willing to take an STD test. And then we will establish boundaries and we will keep them. We will reconnect with each other every after an experience to maintain our bond. Bottom line, if we will be in a similar situation, we will be more intelligent, there will be rules, and we will be very wary that we won’t hurt each other’s feelings.

I could challenge my thoughts about this regret using CBT.

As a recompensation to the long parts not take via video, ask Lea to narrate everything as detailed as possible and record it—no skipping—as much details as possible.

We are meant to be imperfect mistake makers. It is painful and hard. But it is a wonderful thing.

If things didn’t happen this way, I wouldn’t have grown in this area.
