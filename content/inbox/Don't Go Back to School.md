# Don't Go Back to School

**How to be an independent learner**

**SUMMARY**

1. Choose a learning method
2. Find learning resources
3. Evaluate sources of information
4. Stick with it
5. Find a job

**CHOOSE A LEARNING METHOD**

**What you need to do**

1. Identify which approach you will use.
2. Explore the learning strategies that are most effective to you (think back to what has worked for you in the past or try something new).
3. Use a combination of strategies.
4. Change what isn’t working.

**Two approaches to learn independently**

1. **General Knowledge.** Learning to gain mastery and understanding in a specific area of knowledge.
2. ::Project-driven.:: Learning what you need to complete a specific project.

**Learning strategies (ways of acquiring knowledge)**

- Reading
- Listening to lectures
- Discussing your subject with others
- Explaining or teaching what you’re learning
- Collaborating on learning projects
- Attending workshops
- Taking online or in-person classes

**Two paths to general knowledge**

1. Linear
2. ::Associative::

Linear

- Follows a trajectory mapped out in an orderly way
- Class, textbook, syllabus, curriculum
- Use to learn a large body of knowledge as a whole
- Use if classroom learning appeals to you but you want to do it outside school

How to do linear learning

- Find an introductory course online
- Read an introductory textbook
- Learn the material in a commonly taught sequence of concepts
- Completing established levels of advancement through the trajectory should give you a sense of accomplishment

Associative

- ::Starts anywhere::
- ::Emerges from a specific curiosity rather than a desire for knowledge in general::
- ::Result: deeper understanding on some material, and shallower in others::
- ::Easier to follow through on::
- ::Best for people who don’t need a clear sense of completion::

Project-driven learning

- ::More focused::
- ::Built-in means for keeping you motivated::
- ::Built-in means to marking your successes::
- ::Gives you a defined goal and a sense of progress when you finish the project::
- ::Puts your skills and knowledge in an immediate active context that makes them useful::

How to do project-driven learning

- ::Define your project::
- ::Make a list of what you think you need to learn to accomplish it::
- ::Seek out knowledge by a combination of strategies::
- ::Use traditional assignments and exercises but in pursuit of something concrete::

How to do project-driven learning on general knowledge subjects

- ::Turn your pursuit of a naturally abstract subject into a concrete project::
- ::Project: share knowledge with others::
- ::Film, podcast, blog, article, graphic representation, workshop, reading group::

**FIND LEARNING RESOURCES**

**Syllabi**

- Compare a few and decide which seems most clear and compelling

How to look for syllabi

- Search for “syllabi database”; try including or omitting your subject area to narrow or broaden your search.
- Search at particular universities.
- Search for a course in a specific subject
- Search for open courseware materials

Textbooks

- Find one that is respected by teachers
- Find one that students find useful and comprehensible
- It’s okay to use back editions

How to look for textbooks

- Find textbooks assigned in the syllabi of reputable schools
- Check websites (quora, [ask.metafilter.com](http://ask.metafilter.com))
- Ask at collaborative learning communities
- Amazon reviews (as long as contributor is reliable)

Lectures

- Try lectures from a few different scholars or experts
- Try skills-based text or video tutorials

**EVALUATE SOURCES OF INFORMATION**

**Goals**

- Identify biases
- Track how an original reference is used in service of an argument

**How to evaluate sources**

- Triangulation. Read more than one source for the same information and compare their approaches and conclusions.
- Probe the background references relied on by the source and assess the context in which the information was produced, including the funding sources.
- Consider the other things the authors have written.
- Look for a review article on your subject to gain a variety of perspectives.

**STICK WITH IT**

Internal motivators

- ::Work on something you are passionate about::
- ::Work on something you feel strongly you need to know::
- ::Have autonomy over what you are learning and how you’re learning it.::

**Community**

How to find community

- Participate in learning communities of any size
- Join an email list related to the subject you’re interested in
- Ask friends to join you in your learning project
- Ask for referrals on other people interested in the same area
- Start a reading or skill-learning group for people who want to learn what you’re learning or find one
- Attend classes
- Attend events
- Look for extracurricular collaborations with university students

How to use community

- Get feedback on what you are making and thinking about
- Use it to have non arbitrary accountability to the pace and depth of your learning
- Tell other people what you’re setting out to accomplish can help hold you to your plans
- Accomplish something together
- Be a member who contributes

**Keeping track and internalizing what you learn**

- Take notes
- Teach in an informal context
- Discuss what you learn in a conversation
- Write summaries or reflections and sharing them to others
- Document your project

**Get help**

- Practicing the ability to find your own answers by asking others and seeing what others have already asked and answerer is an important skill
- Get in touch with experts who are willing to help or discuss their ideas and knowledge

How to connect with experts

- Do some homework on the subject
- Familiarize yourself to their work and their projects
- Express enthusiasm for their subject
- Write an email asking specific and detailed questions that are relatively brief
- Give positive feedback (what excites you about their work + the ways in which it has influenced you)
- Expect brief responses
- Only ask follow-up questions if you’re invited to
