# *1.2 - The Meaning of a Tribe*

**Tribe**

Find your niche and grow deep inside your group of people, your followers.

**Three Components of a Tribe**

1. A leader
2. A message
3. A way to connect people

You want to find the people who will love what you say so much that they will carry your message somewhere else!

**3 Basic Mark** s

- A tribe is personal (connects with your heart).
- A tribe is small (because it is personal).
- A tribe is empowering (you as the leader should empower your tribe to go out and share the message).

You should have a message that is bigger than you.

Don’t think about connecting to more people.

Think about connecting to one person and ask yourself, how will you connect to that person in a personal way so that he/she can empower others to share your message.

Connect with one person, one at a time, slowly and gradually.

Until you don’t find a common thing that resonates with them you can’t turn that into an audience.

Find that connection.

Start small.
