# Why do I bypass my partners’ privacy?

What is this behavior? Is it damaging to a relationship? What do I need to do to change?

This by itself is a big problem—a trust problem. And my sexual drive is one of the reasons why I bypass my partners’ privacy. I think my sex drive is too intense and I have not effectively briddled it. But I also have trust issues. Is it because of the breakup? I am not sure.

I have this issue even way before. What drives it? This desire to know things I shouldn’t with people I love? What is behind this behavior?

What is my purpose for wanting to tell her about it? I am guilty. I don’t want to feel like a hypocrite. I don’t want our relationship to be built on distrust. It is too important for me that I don’t want it to be built on distrust. What is the full truth?

- I have this weakness: I bypass the privacy of my partners. This started with Precious. I had access to her FB and email. I descovered that she was cheating on me because I had access to her email. I am ashamed to tell this whenever I tell the story of how we broke up.
- With Lea, the only motive for me is to look for past dirty talks. I searched her covo with Beth and with some of her other friends. But it all started with our first date. She left her phone open and I looked at one of her covos. I accidentally sent something and unsent it.

I have two paths then:

1. Alleviation of my guilt and shame
2. Leave the past (treat it as a lesson learned, approach what I have today)

Action

- Make peace with this as best you can before seeking for forgiveness
