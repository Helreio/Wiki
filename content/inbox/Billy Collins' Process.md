# Billy Collins' Process

There’s a lot of waiting around until something happens.

- If you notice this is something that almost all Tungko members experience. Some of us are able to maintain a semi-regular rhythm but that’s just because we intended it and yet still the ideas don’t really come as good as how we want them to be.

I think what gets a poem going is an initiating line. Sometimes a first line will occur, and it goes nowhere; but other times—and this, I think, is a sense you develop—I can tell that the line wants to continue. If it does, I can feel a sense of momentum—the poem finds a reason for continuing. The first line is the DNA of the poem; the rest of the poem is constructed out of that first line. A lot of it has to do with tone because tone is the key signature for the poem.

- I agree to some of his description. But I am also careful not to conclude that this is what happens to ALL poets ALL the time. For example, sometimes, the DNA of my poem is just a thought that is never directly stated in the poem. The first line is not always the core of what I want to say. It serves the idea but it isn’t the idea itself.

Like most poets, I don’t know where I’m going. The pen is an instrument of discovery rather than just a recording implement.

- In my experience, poetry is definitely the most “surprising” writing I have ever engaged myself into. In constructing an essay, especially if I am going to explain something, I tend to already know what I will write about and this is definitely the easiest way to do it. One may try this out in poetry, sketching a poem, planning a poem and I believe some poets have this as a process. But I too enjoy the not knowing part of poetry very much. However, I, again, want to emphasize that this is just one way of writing poetry and is not necessarily the ONLY good way to do it.

Also, I try to start the poem conversationally. Poems, for me, begin as a social engagement. I want to establish a kind of sociability or even hospitality at the beginning of a poem. The title and the first few lines are a kind of welcome mat where I am inviting the reader inside. What I do with the reader later can be more complicated, but the beginning of the poem is a seductive technique for me, a way of making a basic engagement.

- What I realized from what he said here is that part of the process of writing poetry requires a lot of intentionality and slow thinking, which is unlike the first spark of idea, which is intuitive for sure. The second or longer part of writing a poem, in my experience, requires some (not necessarily a lot) of conscious and intentional thinking, where I exercise agency (not the mysterious intuition that I didn’t have agency into).

I say, Get rid of it. Because if it got into a later poem it would be Scotch-taped on. It would not be part of the organic, you know, chi, the spine that the poem has, the way it all should be one continuous movement. Poems that lack that seem very mechanically put together, like a piece here and a part there.

- I have some reservations for what he said here partly because I do blackout poetry and by their nature blackout poems are scotch-taped poems. Their mechanical nature is what makes them different. And the reason why I like them is because I don’t have to stress a lot about being original when I do them. I could experience a little stress with looking for patterns between words, but at least I am taking a rest from the stress of trying to be original all the time. Of course, it isn’t impossible that a blackout poem suddenly emerges like a traditional poem and will have this characteristic of having a continuum (chi). However, what if it doesn’t have this? Is it a bad poem? Was my process of coming up with it a wrong way of doing poetry even if I enjoyed doing the process? Is chi an objective standard for which poems should be judged? Or is it a subjective standard based on taste?
- We can criticize a poem by not having this element of chi but isn’t our criticism of that poem subjective? Based on our biases and tastes? What if a poet wrote that mechanical poem in a maginhawa way, he feels maginhawa while writing the poem, who are we to judge that his work is not good?

A late bloomer. I stayed kind of underground, never took a workshop, never associated much with other poets.

- This is really good to know. I’m tempted to stay underground to.

It took me a while to figure out how to write a longer poem. I learned how to expand the poem outward. I think it was a matter of letting more of my life into the poems.

- Two good subjects here:
   - How can you put more of your life into your poems?
   - In Tungko, we seem to favor the shorter poems. But why aren’t we talking about longer poems?

Actually, I don’t think you can be really badly influenced by anyone, as long as it makes you write.

- What I understand from Collins here is that the poetics you ascribe to doesn’t matter as long as you are able write. You are only able to write if you feel comfortable about a certain process. What I’m hearing him say is do what works for you. And what works for you is usually what feels good for you. I would like to argue that this is the most basic principle of Ginhawa Poetics. In fact, I would like to advocate that it becomes the ONLY principle: “Do what feels good for you.” The reason why I hope it becomes the ONLY principle is because, if we ADD more principles, we are adding more rules and prescriptions to the point where we can actually hinder the individual’s search for what feels good for him or her.

I was under the mistaken modernist belief that there was an unbreakable connection between value and difficulty, so I wrote a lot of impenetrable poetry.

- This is so true in the University. But this is also where my question enters: What if an intellectual poet enters Tungko and says he write intellectual poems because that is what is maginhawa for him. Is there a room for him here? There seems to be two needs that are not always mutually connected: the need to have a maginhawa practice and the need to produce poems that are maginhawa for others.

I think your voice is always inside of you, and you find it by releasing things into your work that you have inside. I grew by allowing aspects of myself that I had previously excluded into the poetry. I think all poets—younger poets particularly—have a private sense of decorum, meaning they feel there are certain things they should write about and other things they shouldn’t. I don’t even think this is conscious in most cases, but like other young poets I would put on my poetry goggles when I wrote and I would see only these so-called poetic things I should write about, and the rest of my life was very disconnected from that. There was, for instance, no humor. I thought poetry should be humorless.

- My dream is for poetry to be freeing and if Tungko evolves into that place where we are free to explore the different parts of us then what a treat. That no topic is out of the conversation. No form is out of experimentation. Of course, there are intricacies of this and we shouldn’t expect Tungko to immediately be like this. But it’s a nice dream. I also think that this should be one of the main goals of Tungko and Ginhawa poetics to live up to its critique of traditional poetry. To be truly an alternative way, it has to be freeing, it should be as much as possible prevent creating rules on what should be and what shouldn’t be explored. It would be nice to see that each KaTungko is exploring their own topics and their own structures and there should be a venue for them in Tungko to show their work: they should be given the time to share during gatherings or they should be given space in the website to show their work. We need to give them voice and there shouldn’t be no censorship as much as possible.

If you had to construct a poet out of whole cloth, so to speak, what attributes would you give him or her?

First, a sense of attentiveness. Then wanting to hang around the language.

I think there’s another thing, a kind of attitude—an attitude of not ever getting used to being alive, of not ever taking your life for granted.

And laziness! Not being able to write more than half an hour a day.

- These are good principles to incorporate in Tungko:
   - Attentiveness
   - Love of Language
   - Gratefulness
   - Laziness

Ask yourself if what you are trying to say can be said in any other form—story, memoir, letter, phone call, e -mail, magazine article, novel. If the answer is yes, stop writing poetry. Put it in an e-mail, write a memoir, write a letter to your granny, use whatever form will accommodate what you’re going to say. Stop writing poetry unless you’re doing things that you can only do in poetry. And that means exercising your imaginative freedom, because in a poem you have the greatest imaginative freedom possible in language. You have no allegiance to plot, consistency, plausibility, character development, chronology. You can fly.

- This is also a good way of seeing that NOT ALL THINGS SHOULD BE SAID IN POETRY FORM. Although we should allow for the most freedom in exploration of topic and form in poetry, I think this advice is really good. Poetry is NOT the sole way of communication. It is ONE way of communication. It communicates certain things effectively (or at least tries to) but for sure it also can’t communicate everything. For example, I find that poetry is very good in trying to communicate my subjective thoughts and emotions but it is very poor in communicating objective truth and facts about the world. It can muddle explanations and can create confusion.

For me poetry was always a solo act. A romantic idea maybe, but I thought that poetry was something you did in solitude, and the idea of sharing your work with anybody was completely antithetical to what I thought poetry was all about.

- The challenge for Tungko: How can Tungko be a place of community that does not muddle with the solitude that poetry requires. How can we be alone together in Tungko? Something the quakers do. How can it be a space where an individual’s need for community and need for authenticity is both fulfilled.

Well, in one sense—a loose sense—I consider all my poems to be formal. I try to write poems that are a series of clear, solid lines, to give each poem a stanzaic shape, and usually to organize poems around a beginning, middle and end, or at least a distinct turn. I hope all that adds up to a certain degree of formality, an appearance of formality, anyway.

- I like this. The idea for the poem may come intuitively (as is almost always the case for me). But it does not write itself intuitively. This does not happen to all of us all the time. Even if the poem comes almost 75% by intuition. There is still some 25% work done by the conscious intellect of the brain. And I don’t want to ignore that 25% part. The intellectual is as important as the intuitive part of my mind. In some cases, even more important.

You know, this week we’ll write a villanelle, next week a sestina. Such an artificial way to proceed! I agree with Richard Wilbur who said that you shouldn’t write a sonnet unless you have a sonnetlike thing to say.

- I’m curious how you would answer this given that Tungko was, in a way, structured like this. The lessons during the weekends were by forms.

The image one has to present as a performer, as an interviewee and whatnot, is a very different self from the sensibility that actually creates the poems. You need to keep your center, the part that writes the poems, and not spin off into popularity.

- This is where I would say that the need to write maginhawa-ly and the need to write something that is maginhawa to others can be two very different selves.
