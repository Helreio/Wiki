1. I want to feel wise.
2. I want to feel mentally vibrant.
3. I want to feel physically vibrant.
4. I want to feel connected.
5. I want to feel materially sufficient.
6. I want to feel materially efficient.
7. I want to feel materially resilient.
8. I want to feel creatively free.

TO DO

I need to improve this list. I need to consider whether I need to use emotions based on the emotion wheel.

Purpose and these desiresâ€”these should be nailed because they are the direction. I need to have a proper understanding of these things if I want to articulate these core desires clearly.
