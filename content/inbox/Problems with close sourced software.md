# Problems with close sourced software

When you buy a closed source product you implicitly sign mandatory licensing agreements.

These agreements allow companies to not sell you a copy of the product. They don't sell you the product itself. They sell you the license to use the product. What you can do with it is very limited.

- Purpose of uses, shareability, alteration, hardware that can run it

Source available is not open source

- Product that is available in public but cannot be modified without payment

Open source is usually free software

Free software should not be confused with open source

- The former is a philosophy; the latter is a development model (collaborators contribute to a piece of software together).

Benefits of open source

- Free to use
- If licensed under GPL, it can be studied, modified, and shared.
- Quick implementation of new features and standards
- Security and error checking benefits of large community
