# Dreaming

When we check the news it is like we enter into an entirely different universe. People who like to live outside the news and inside what is possible - an ideal world, we feel like living in ideals - even if it seems like a fantasy total outside reality - is more meaningful. Dreaming soothes the wounds brought by a dreamless world.
