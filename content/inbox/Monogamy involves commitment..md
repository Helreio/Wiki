# Monogamy involves commitment.

The stakes are too high because

- You only have one life.
- While breakup is an option, it isn't easy and it can be ugly.
- Divorce or annulment is expensive.
- The emotional burden of breakups especially when the relationship is prolonged is too heavy

The optimal strategy

- Be very careful on choosing who to date
- While dating, be vigilant about glaring issues
