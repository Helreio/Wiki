# One Thing Company of One with Paul Jarvis

# One Thing: Company of One with Paul Jarvis

There is no blueprint. So why not question norms and do what makes sense to you, your business, and your customers.

When you’re starting out, grow towards enough.

But, know when you’ve hit enough.

And know what changes in your business if you’ve hit enough.

Aspire for a particular annual income.

When you hit that, you don’t have to work more for more revenue.

No routine or schedule.

Everyday looks different.

Most of his income come from products.

Paul works on projects or products that he can build on himself.

He doesn’t want to work on projects that require a bigger team.

He isn’t good with managing people.

He wants to focus on writing and design.

He worked hard to make his onboarding process to his courses easy so that students will have very little questions.

He spends most of his time making the lessons better.

He reached enough when he was doing client work.

He was very good at communicating with clients that is why he was fully booked with clients who were paying him good amount of money.

He did this for 12 years.

His goal for products was:

- The products need to make more money than he was earning with clients
- But it needs to make less time working to create them

It took him about 2 and a half years to go from freelancing to products.

During this time, freelancing was his priority. He had to move product launches so he can focus on emergencies with clients.

When he hires freelancers he hires the best so that he doesn’t have to manage them.

He outsources skills that he isn’t good at.

Freelancers are his biggest expenses.

60k or 50k.

Expenses with SAS are cheaper.

He hires freelancers to support the industry.

He loves MailChimp software and company.

He doesn’t use a lot of software.

He uses Fathom.

Freedom and what’s best for you now and in the long-term.

Build a company for a long-term, serve your people for the long-term.

Building a business is a marathon.

He wants people to be in his list forever.

- He has it for 6 years now.
- He just sends email every Sunday.
- Slow-build relationship to subscribers.

I don’t want to push harder on my audience then alienate them. I want to build a long-term relationship with them.

He makes more money when he opens his courses 2 weeks a year than every week of the year.
