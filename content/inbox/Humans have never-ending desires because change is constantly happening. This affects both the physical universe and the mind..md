# Humans have never-ending desires because change is constantly happening. This affects both the physical universe and the mind.

Change happens in the physical universe, which in turn affect our mental states.

Likewise, mental states don't remain the same. They change a lot and often.

Mental states that felt rewarding creates a desire in the mind to pursue them again. This desire arises because the mentally-rewarding state is fleeting. It lasts for a short while. Mental states have to be pursued again and again because they are fleeting.

Desires are satisfied but they arise again.

This is also the reason why getting to the point of perfection - where nothing remains wanted and no action is necessary - is delusional.

Again: process over destination. Practice over goal. Journey is the reward.
