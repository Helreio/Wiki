Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (also Patanjala Yoga Sutras or Yoga Darsana)

# 1. Now the exposition of yoga is being made.

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056879,120.453705)

Philosophy + Practice = Ultimate Goal

# 2. The restraint of the modifications of the mind-stuff is Yoga.

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056868,120.453731)

Goal of yoga = the restraint of the mental modifications.

Citta - sum total of the mind.

- Ahamkara - basic mind, ego, “I” feeling.
- Buddhi - intellect or discriminative faculty.
- Manas - desiring part of the mind, gets attracted to outside things through the senses.

These three things happen so quickly.

They disturb the normal condition of the mind.

Normal or original condition of the mind = peaceful position.

All the differences in the outside world are the outcomes of your mental modifications.

The outside world is based on your thoughts and mental attitude.

The entire world is your projection.

Your values may change within a second.

We shouldn’t put too much stress on outward things.

Yoga = Don’t bother much about changing the world.

Things outside neither bind nor liberate you; only your attitude towards them does that.

Control

# 3. Then the Seer (Self) abides in Its own nature.

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056813,120.453715)

You are not the body or the mind.

Your are the Knower or Seer.

Consciousness = Spirit

Mind - creates thoughts; distinguishes and desires.

To understand the eternal peaceful you, the mind must be quiet.

The Seer can never misunderstand or forget itself.

You can’t see your true Self because your mind is coloured.

Make the mind clean and pure to go back to your original state.

Make citta completely free of vrtttis and see your true Self.

# 4. At other times [the Self appears to] assume the forms of the mental modifications.

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056879,120.453705)

Without any identifications, who are you?

Detach yourself completely from all the things you have identified yourself with.

Realise yourself as the pure “I."

We are the same.

There is no difference between you and I.

Human, animal, inanimate beings - all are the same - spirit/energy makes us all.

The same energy appears in different forms to which we also give different names.

The form and names are just different versions of the same energy.

Behind the different forms of energy is one unchanging consciousness or Spirit or Self.

Yogic Life = Calming the mind to find the unity among everything.

With this experience of universal unity, we function better.

We will have happy and harmonious lives.

Only then can we love our neighbours as our own Self.

The One is never changing.

The One appears to change due to our mental modifications.

Change your mind = change everything.

There is nothing wrong outside.

Correct your vision = correct outside.

Yoga

- [ ] Self-reformation
- [ ] Self-control
- [ ] Self-adjustment

When this reformation is accomplished we will see a new world, a harmonious and happy world.

Always keep yourself free from these wrong identifications.

# 5. There are five kinds of mental modifications which are either painful or painless.

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056879,120.453705)

Vrttis - 5 kinds

2 categories

- Selfish (Painful)
- Selfless (Painless)

Analyze all our motives.

Cultivate selfless thoughts. That is our primary duty.

Goal - Make the mind thoughtless,

This is not an easy goal.

Change negative thoughts with positive thoughts first.

Forget your selfishness.

Make others happy, and you will be the happiest person.

You can only be selfish on the idea of retaining peace.

Yoga practice - watch our own thoughts and analyse them.

# 6. They are right knowledge, misconception, verbal delusion, sleep, and memory.

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056879,120.453705)

**5 Types of Vrrtis**

1. Knowledge
2. Misconception
3. Verbal Delusion
4. Sleep
5. Memory

# 7. The sources of right knowledge are direct perception, inference and scriptural testimony.

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056879,120.453705)

# 8. Misconception occurs when knowledge of something is not based upon its true form.

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056845,120.453695)

# 9. An image that arises on hearing mere words without any reality [as its basis] is verbal delusion.

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056795,120.453681)

In vikalpah (verbal delusion), there is nothing there. But you still create some opinion about it.

Verbal delusion can still create an impression in your mind.

# 10. That mental modification supported by cognition of nothingness is sleep.

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056500,120.453632)

We still have a though at sleep. It’s the thought of not having a thought.

# 11. When a mental modification of an object previously experienced and not forgotten comes to consciousness, that is memory.

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056793,120.453682)

2 kinds of memories

- Dreams
- Day dreams

**5 Types of Vrrtis**

1. Knowledge
2. Misconception
3. Verbal Delusion
4. Sleep
5. Memory

These Vrrtis (or thought forms) should be controlled to make the mind void and to make inner peace shine through.

The mind is controlling us.

We have to control it.

# 12. These mental modifications are restrained by practice and non-attachment.

**2 ways of restraining Vrrtis**

- Positive - Practice
- Negative - non-attachement

# 13. Of these two, effort toward steadiness of mind is practice.

Continuous practice.

Not just for one or two days.

Not just for a few minutes a day.

You have to become eternally watchful, scrutinising every thought, every word and every action.

# 14. Practice becomes firmly grounded when well attended to for a long time, without break and in all earnestness.

**Qualifications for the practice**

1. Should be done in a long time.
2. Without break (continuous practice).
3. With full attention, with the entire application of the mind, and with full faith in your achievement.

**3 qualities to achieve the qualifications**

1. Patience
2. Devotion
3. Faith

# 15. The consciousness of self-mastery in one who is free from craving from objects seen or heard about is non-attachment.
