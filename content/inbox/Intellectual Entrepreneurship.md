# Intellectual Entrepreneurship

I can sell ideas. I can become an entrepreneur in the world of ideas; a creative entrepreneur but specifically paid for the quality of my ideas, a thought leader.

There are two things I can sell:

1. Theory - I can sell the conceptual tools, frameworks, etc.
2. Methods - I can sell workshops about my methods (e.g., zettelkasten, PKM, etc.)
