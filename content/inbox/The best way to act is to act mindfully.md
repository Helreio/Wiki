# The best way to act is to act mindfully

Ideally, when you act, you are present and are not in a compulsive managerial mode. You are free to immerse yourself to what you have intended to do, knowing that what you are doing is what you want to do.

This state of mind is only achieved if your action is aligned to who you are and what you value, which is achieved through [[thoughts/intentional living]].
