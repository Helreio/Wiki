"Beyond this mountain ranges," said

the local merchant of strawberry spread,

"is another mountain, an enchanted one

of which no man has climbed, no man."

She said its slopes are filled with trees

and flowers and abundant bees

dried leaves and decay no man has seen

the foliage are every green.
