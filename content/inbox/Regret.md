# Regret

Regret is never a useful reaction to past events.

The 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza reasoned that remorse and repentance are pernicious intoxicants that interfere with our understanding: It is out of rashness that we transgress and it is out of rashness that that we pound our heads about our transgressions. Our main aim, he believed, should be to avoid acting on impulse and emotion and to be guided by reason. Nietzsche agreed, calling remorse “adding to the first act of stupidity a second.”

Those who believe that regret is useful argue that mulling over mistakes help us not repeat them.

For stoics, regret is classified as *pathē* or negative passions, which means that it is unhealthy. Negative passions are the opposite of positive passions or *eupatheiai.* The rejection of negative passions is necessary in Stoicism's ultimate goal, which is apatheia, or equanimity towards events.

The right attitude with regards to regret according to stoics is to learn from past events and mistakes but to do so cognitively and not emotionally, where we allow ourselves to feel bad about something that cannot be changed.

Remember, that the past is beyond our control. What we can control is our current actions.

For stoicism, regret interfers with our goal of achieving apatheia and it ignores the dichotomy of control because the past is outside our control.

Another stoic argument on regret is that regret is about talking to yourself about how bad you are. But Stoicism is about action. Stop regretting and do some good instead.

[[inbox/live in the now]] because life happens in the present moment. The future and past are beyond our control. If we let ourselves be influece by the past, we are influence by something imaginary.

You don’t have to denounce the past. You don’t have to run away from it. What you can do is to come to terms with it and choose to no longer be bothered by it. If you reach this state of mind, you have attained freedom.

Make the most out of the present moment, so you cna build the foundation of a future you will not regret.
