# Will you use rights language to protect or enhance your freedom?

In anarchy, human freedom is the most important good. All human beings should be allowed to exercise and optimize their freedom.

However, if a person's freedom encroaches on my freedom, protecting myself is the most logical response, which the principles of anarchy also supports.

In protecting myself, do I encroach someone else's freedom? Would I be breaking the principle of freedom altogether? Will I use rights language to support my campaign for more freedom? If yes, where is integrity there? Where is non-duplicity?
