# What we call happiness is a mental state.

Mental states are states, which means

1. They happen in the realm of the mind (mental)
2. They happen just once in the stream of time and therefore are forever unique

Therefore, strictly speaking, what we call happiness is really a series of happinesses.

Do distinguish a state from another, you may use an identity tag like a number, for example "happiness 1" to distinguish it from "happiness 2".

"Happiness" is a word we use to signify that these completely unique states are "similar" in some way, although not entirely the same.

The similarity cannot be defined or explained objectively. It is a subjective experience. What you refer to as "your" experience of happiness may not be the same as my experience or idea of happiness.
