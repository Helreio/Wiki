# Should I buy a new laptop?

Are there other things that are my priority other than a new laptop?

- washing machine
- new clothes

Here's a fact: I am spending more than what I am earning. Either I cut expenses or I earn more.

How do I prevent myself from wanting more than what I currently have?

I was triggered only because I can't use craft x in catalina.

However here's another fact: I will be only truly spending 34k for this machine because I sold the laptop to Lea.

I have made several spending mistakes in the past year. How can I prevent more mistakes moving forward?

- budget investment income (accept the fact that you can't do more than this) perhaps 10,000 per month?
- budget spending fund (what things are worth spending for that will improve my life?)
- no more buying outside credible places
- Buy brand new

₱50,000

- ₱15,000 investment
- ₱20,000 base expenses
- ₱15,000 cache

I will wait until tomorrow before I buy.

I could later transition to a cheaper OS option, but this will take a lot of time and I am not sure I have that time.

Also, I could recompensate the expense by

- Selling stuff
- Working more hours
- Selling the Macbook Pro mid-2012
