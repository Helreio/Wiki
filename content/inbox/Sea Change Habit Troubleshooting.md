# Sea Change Habit Troubleshooting

# *Turn Inspiration Into Action*

How many times have you read a great article, or had an idea, or wanted to make a change … but then didn’t?

It’s one of the biggest frustrations for people who read this site: people blame themselves for not implementing a plan to change habits.

It takes a switch in gears.

I remember a boatload of times when I’ve been really inspired by something, but then didn’t take action. I wanted to run a marathon, do a triathlon, write a book, start a blog, lose weight, get out of debt, start waking early, simplify my life. But I didn’t actually do anything about it.

I was busy. I was tired. I had other things to do. But those were just excuses.

I learned a few things that worked for me, and within a year or so, I’d done all those things I mentioned above. I took action and made them happen. The excuses got beat.

Here’s what works for me:

1. **Tell someone you’re going to do it**. If you just think it in your head, you’re not committed. It won’t happen. Start by getting up and telling someone near you, right now. Or email someone.
2. **Now carve out time**. Lots of people actually do step 1 but not this step. You have to make the time. Even if it’s just 10 minutes a day — when will you do it? After what part of your regular routine? Even if you don’t have a routine, there are things you do every day: wake up, maybe shower and/or brush your teeth, eat breakfast or lunch, open your computer, get off work or school, go to bed, etc. Put it on your calendar, right away.
3. **Start as small as you can**. Most people make the mistake of overcommitting, because they’re so inspired. But you’re *less likely* to succeed if you say that you’re going to work out an hour a day, or learn a new skill for 2 hours a day. Even 30 minutes a day is too much. Start with 10. Or 5. Or 2, if you’re really busy. You have time for 2 minutes a day.
4. **Really commit**. The biggest reason most people fail is they’re not really committed. You tell someone, and you think you’re committed, but you’re not. If you’re really committed, write it on your blog (or start one). Post it on Facebook or Twitter. Tell 100 people about it. Put money on it. Say that you’ll sing in public if you fail. Make people hold you accountable.
5. **Have reminders**. It’s easy to forget when you start out. If you want to go for a 10-minute run after you wake up, you need something to make sure you don’t forget: put your running shoes next to your bed or in your doorway, laid out with running clothes. Or sleep in your running clothes. Put up a big sign somewhere you won’t miss it. Use sticky notes, stuck to your computer. Computer and phone reminders are good too.
6. **At the moment when you want to avoid it, pause**. There will be a moment (or a bunch of moments) when you think, “Oh, I’ll do it tomorrow.” That’s the moment you have to not let pass idly by. Stop yourself, and just sit there for a moment, not going on your computer, just turning inward. What are you afraid of? What’s stopping you? There is a discomfort you’re trying to avoid. Instead, smile, and start. Do it and enjoy it in the moment. You’ll love it.

# *If You’re Starting Sea Change Mid-Month*

So you’ve signed up for the Sea Change Program, but not at the beginning of the month, and the current month’s course or module has already started. That’s OK!

Whether you’re coming in during the 2nd week, the 3rd week, the 4th, you’re totally fine to start today.

There’s no requirement that you start at any specific day. Habits don’t work according to the calendar.

Just start the course and get started today! You’re on your own path, not everyone else’s.

# *You Started, Stopped – How to Restart*

A common problem with a program like Sea Change is that members get excited about starting a plan, do great for a few days or a week (or more), and then something happens that stops them.

What should you do if this happens to you?

Restart, asap!

The sooner you restart, the better. Let go of the guilt. Don’t worry about failure. Don’t worry about a lack of discipline.

Here’s what to worry about: what happened? The failure is just a lesson about your method — it’s not a reflection on you. If your method didn’t work, tweak it so it’ll work better this time.

And get started again, today!

The longer you wait to restart, the harder it seems to be. So if you have waited 1 or 2 days, it’ll be easier to restart. If you’ve already waited 10 days or two weeks, it’ll be a little more difficult, only because of guilt and a negative belief in your ability to do the plan. However: **the guilt and negative feelings are completely made up in your head**. They are a movie you are playing — pause that movie, and play another, more positive movie.

Here’s what to do in any case:

1. **Restart today**. Don’t worry about the failure — just get going again. Put your effort into doing even just 2 minutes of your habit today.
2. **Let go of guilt**. The guilt and negative thoughts are a movie playing in your head — they aren’t true. Let them go, breathe a sigh of relief, and congratulate yourself for having the courage to start again.
3. **Improve the method**. Was the habit too hard? Do a smaller, easier version. Did something come up that got in the way? That happens — try to think ahead and plan around those things next time, or if they happen unexpectedly, give yourself 1-2 days off and focus your efforts on starting again as soon as you can. Is the time of day you were doing the habit not a good time? Try another time. Did you not feel motivated? Add some accountability.
4. **Just do a little, every day**. You don’t have to do that much to get going. Just do a very bare minimum, and make it easy on yourself. This isn’t supposed to be hard work — it’s supposed to be consistent work, as much as possible. So do a little, and do it regularly, and have fun doing it.

# *Overcoming Obstacles to Change*

The Sea Change Program is about change … but change isn’t always easy. That’s because there are a set of common obstacles that get in our way, and being able to create lasting change is a matter of learning a set of techniques and skills to overcome those obstacles.

So in this article, we’ll do an overview of what I’ve found to be the most common obstacles, and some solutions I’ve found to be useful.

If you can overcome these obstacles, nothing is standing in your way of lasting, meaningful change!

**1. Overwhelmed or intimidated**. Often people don’t even start a change because it seems intimidating or overwhelming. The best solution for this is to make the change easier — make it smaller. For example, instead of thinking of doing 20-30 minutes of exercise, just do 5 minutes. Five minutes of any change is not hard or overwhelming.

**2. Fear**. Many people fear failure, or fear the unknown. The best way to combat fear is by making it less scary, and then having small successes that make you more confident and less afraid. For example, if you think you can’t learn Spanish, try just learning to say hello, goodbye, and thank you. That’s a small change that isn’t scary, and you can succeed at it easily. Then you feel confident enough to learn a few more words, and doing that second step makes you feel less afraid and even more confident, and so on, until you’re no longer afraid of tackling the change. Build success and confidence with small steps that are easy and not scary.

**3. Not enough time**. We’re busy, so we put off starting a change until later … or start it, but then it gets sidetracked because we get busy. The best solution is actually the same as the solutions for the first two items on this list — make the change smaller. If you just do 5 minutes a day, you’ll have the time. Note that this solution helps overcome three of the top obstacles on this list — which is why small changes are so incredibly important for overcoming obstacles.

**4. Other things take priority**. You’re excited about a change, but then other projects or events take priority, pushing your change to the backburner. The best solution for this is to learn to make your current change a priority at all times, and a great technique for learning this is to be fully committed in every way. To fully commit, tell the world about it, and keep everyone updated so you’ll feel accountable. Write reminders for yourself everywhere, have a desktop picture that helps keep you focused on the change, and have change partners or a group that’s doing the change with you.

**5. Resistance from others**. This can be one of the toughest obstacles, because we don’t have complete control over it. We can’t force other people to be supportive. I plan to do a full article and webinar just on this topic, because I think it’s so important and so difficult for many people. However, some suggestions for now: instead of imposing your changes on others, get them involved early in the decision-making process, ask for their help, have them be a part of the change process rather than just an observer — or more likely in their view, someone who is affected by a change he or she hasn’t agreed to. Ask for people’s support, but don’t threaten to change their lives without their consent.

**6. No motivation**. If you’re not motivated to do a change, you’ll stop when things get difficult. You’ll give up. I recommend that you don’t do changes you’re not excited about, at least at first as you’re learning the skill of change. Two of the best ways to stay motivated: 1) Focus on the enjoyment of the habit, rather than doing it as a chore, and 2) Do it with others, or use public accountability to stay motivated.

**7. Can’t stick to it for long**. Actually this is usually a symptom of other problems on this list. But if you do have a problem sticking to a change for long, consider what the reasons are — is it lack of motivation, other things taking priority, negative thoughts, fear? What you want to do is address these issues, and then focus on a small change that you can do consistently, every day, for as many consecutive days as possible. Again, use public accountability or a change partner/group to keep your streak going.

**8. Negative thoughts (I can’t do it)**. I’m not good enough. I’m not strong enough, or disciplined enough. It’s not worth it! These thoughts run through the backs of our minds without our being aware of them. So the most important step is to learn to listen for these negative thoughts, and to become aware of them. Next, learn to squash them like bugs, and replace them with positive thoughts. It’s incredibly effective, and can be learned with practice.

**9. Guilt from failing**. How often have you slipped up, then felt guilty about slipping up, and then allowed that guilt to keep you from trying again? Guilt is a tough one, because it’s one of those insidious feelings that we barely notice but that has such a strong effect on us. In truth, it’s just another of those negative thoughts we just mentioned. You have to learn to be aware of it, then crush it and replace it with a positive thought. Tell yourself that when you slip and fall, it’s just another lesson that will teach you to be better at change. I certainly wouldn’t be as good as I am today if it weren’t for countless failures. So let the guilt go, and learn, and try again.

**10. Temptations**. You’re trying to eat healthy, but there’s a lush chocolate cupcake right in front of you. Oh, it’s too hard! Well, yes, temptations can be very difficult. There are multiple strategies that work for me. First, create a temptation-free environment. That might mean removing it completely from your home, not going to places where the temptation exists, staying away from it at work, etc. Second, if the temptation happens despite your best efforts to remove it from your life, allow yourself to have some — but just a little. You don’t want to feel like you’re restricting yourself too much, or you’ll have a hard time sticking to your change. Third, learn to think of your change as not a sacrifice, but a good change — start thinking of the temptation in a negative light (those fries will leave me feeling greasy and salty and bloated and fat) and the change in a good light (I really love fruit, and how fresh it tastes and how healthy I feel).

# *Feeling Tired, Lazy, Stressed, Overwhelmed*

All the habit strategies in the world will not work if you’re too tired, stressed out, or overwhelmed by all the work and information that’s coming at you.

When your stress levels are high or energy levels are very low, it’s hard to maintain any kind of discipline. You just want to be lazy.

Fortunately, there are ways to overcome this.

**1. The first step is to be aware of the problem**. Take a moment to assess your level of exhaustion and stress. If you think this is the reason you’re putting off the habit, then there are ways to deal with it.

**2. If you’re tired, can you get more rest?** This is the best way to deal with exhaustion. Many people simply don’t get enough sleep. They’re running on high octane all day, then stay up late and don’t have enough rest before starting another high-energy day. You can do this for a little while, but eventually the lack of rest will affect you — you’ll start dragging, feeling lazy and burnt out, and want to procrastinate. You might even get sick. The best thing is to get more sleep at night, but a good nap also helps a lot. Even just 30 minutes. An hour is better, if possible.

**3. Take a break**. Get away from the computer, and take a walk. This is the best way to deal with stress — find ways to de-stress. Stretch. Move around. Massage your neck and shoulders. Get some fresh air. Talk to someone in real life. Take a hot bath or shower if that’s available.

**4. Exercise daily**. I’ve found exercise to be one of the best ways to reduce stress. A good fast walk, an honest run, some strength exercises, a swim or bike, playing a sport. Not only does exercise reduce stress, but it helps you to sleep better at night. While I say exercise daily, really it’s best to have at least 1-2 rest days a week, not including a bit of walking.

**5. Get the overwhelm under control**. Sometimes you’re stressed or overwhelmed because there’s too much going on in your life, or too much information coming in. There are ways to deal with this. First, make a list of all you have going on right now. Now see if you can put a hold or delete a few of them — simply send an email or make a call and tell people you can’t work on this right now. Make a short list of 3-5 tasks you can actually work on today, and focus on the first item only.

**6. If you have information overload, see if you can reduce or eliminate some of the information coming in**. Unsubscribe from things in email, RSS, Twitter, Facebook. Limit your time in these communication mediums to certain periods a day, so you can disconnect and focus.

**7. Breathe**. Literally, breathe. Focus on your breath as it comes into your body, and then goes out. Relax your jaw. Smile. Slow down for a minute. Return your mind to your breath. Let your tensions go out with your breath. Remind yourself that all that you have going on … doesn’t matter that much. At the end of the day, life will go on. This breathing exercise is available to you at any time of day.

**8. Make your task your meditation**. Just as the breathing exercise can help calm you down and return you to the present moment, so can working on a task. Close all programs and devices and notifications not necessary for working on your task, and be mindful as you work on the task. Notice your thoughts, breath, fingers tapping away, body as it becomes stressed or relaxed. This is a form of meditation, and you can do it for each task.

# *How to Deal With Forming Multiple Habits over the Months*

One of the biggest questions people have for me, if they stick to the Sea Change program for more than 2-3 months, is how to deal with multiple habits at once?

So you start out by creating one habit the first month — great! Then a new habit the second month — awesome! And then a third habit the third month — woah, this is cool, but is it sustainable? And then when you get to the fourth month, you feel a bit overwhelmed. By the time your in month 5-6, yikes, things are hard to maintain.

Yes, this is a problem.

We’re going to figure out how to deal with them right now. Woohoo! Habits are like a big party, right?

Let’s look at three different strategies, and then how to figure out what to do.

### Strategy 1: Combine Habits

This strategy can be really cool if the habits you’re forming complement each other. If they do, you might be able to do two at once, or in conjunction.

Some examples:

- Combine gratitude with decluttering (or another physical habit) – take each item you’re decluttering, and be grateful it was in your life and is going out to a better home, and then be grateful for the items still in your life.
- Combine meditation with exercise – take a minute to meditate before you exercise, then practice mindfulness while doing the exercise itself.
- Combine meditation with healthy eating and gratitude – mindfully consider your meals beforehand, have a gratitude prayer before you eat each food, eat food in silence mindfully, watching your thoughts and feelings and truly experiencing the flavors of the healthy food.
- Combine writing daily with procrastination – really they’re the same habit, of clearing aside distractions, and just writing (instead of procrastinating).

And so forth. This can help make your habits manageable, so you don’t have to have a thousand new habits filling up your schedule.

### Strategy 2: Drop Habits

But sometimes you just can’t manage 12 new habits, and it’s better if you drop a habit or two.

So what you want to do is evaluate which habits you’re really enjoying, and which are having the biggest positive impact on your life. Sometimes habits sound good but once you put them into practice they’re not what you imagined they’d be.

Give yourself permission to drop a habit. You can always come back to it later, but permission to drop a habit is acknowledgement that you can’t cram everything into an already-busy schedule, and you need to give yourself space to focus on what you really want in your life at this moment.

### Strategy 3: Two-Month Habits

In this strategy, you consciously choose *not* to form a new habit every month, not to join us on every new module in Sea Change.

I have a new module each month for those who want to join, but it’s not mandatory, nor even recommended for every single person. Some people don’t want to form the new month’s habit, and some already have enough habits to work on.

So in this strategy, you choose to take two months to form a habit, or even three. This way the habit will be much more solid, and you don’t form new habits at such a breakneck speed that it’s unmanageable for your life.

### How to Decide What to Do

So how do you decide which strategy to use — or whether to just tough it out and find room & energy for all the habits?

Here’s what I’d suggest:

1. When considering a new habit, check your gut, and see whether it feels like a huge burden to add another habit, or if you feel comfortable with the other habits you’ve formed and want to do another. If you feel good about it, go for it! If not, continue to the next step.
2. Consider the two-month habits strategy. Honestly, for most people and for most habits, two months is much better. I just do a new habit a month on Sea Change because people are too impatient to wait two months. :)
3. Next, if you really want to add the new habit, consider combining two habits, if the new habit would nicely combine with one of your existing habits.
4. Finally, there’s nothing wrong with dropping an old habit to make room for a new one. The old habit might have worked well in your life, but maybe it’s not exciting you anymore, or the new one is more attractive. Dropping is perfectly permissible. It creates some nice space for a new habit.

I’ve dropped many habits in my habit-change career. Habits are a flexible pursuit of learning, not a rigid plan you have to follow for life. Your lifestyle changes as you create and drop and modify habits, but over time, fluidly, as you learn what works for you at this moment. That might be one thing this month, but a completely different thing in six months from now. Don’t get stuck on one way — be open to many ways.

The thing you want to avoid, though, is trying to fit a dozen new habits in your life and then dropping them all because you overloaded. If you feel in danger of that, wipe out multiple habits at once, but keep the ones that matter most. Use this new space to refresh your habit change.
