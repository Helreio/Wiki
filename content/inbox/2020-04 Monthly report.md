# 2020-04 Monthly report

## Summary

The lockdown forced everyone into social isolation, and this has a profound influence particularly  for people like me who are melancholic in nature. Furthermore, almost all of my friends are from far away, and I can’t see them. The only form of social connection I had this month was with my immediate family: Papa, Mama, Bernice, and the pets. Here, Rem’s poetry class, Tungko ng Tula was a life-saver. Twice a week for nine weeks, I had a social gathering of aspiring poets. There, I was able to practice expressing myself creatively in a safe space. I built friendships with complete strangers, most of which I am yet to meet. Aside from Tungko, I also started exploring gamification during this time. This was partly because of the book Reality is Broken. My intention was to learn gamification to incorporate it into my life design. I also started exploring Laurie Santos’ course The Science of Well-being. Aside from poetry, I also started explored blind contour drawing by featuring Filipino icons and comedians. I also launched Mantaltaliwa, a platform of purely Pangasinan works. The biggest challenge I faced this month was the tension inside our house particularly with Bernice. This tension would ultimately lead to my decision to leave Pangasinan for good and start a new life of my own.

## Good Events

- Had an online gathering with Ginhawa
- Watched Rem’s poetry class
- Watched a chick hatched from its egg
- Joined my first Tungko class (2.5 hours long)
- Took the strengths test from VIA and enlightened about it.
- I explored Yukai Chou’s work on gamification.

## Setback and Challenges

- I errupted because of my tension with Bernice. Papa chimed in making things worse. I realized there is no use fixing the family and that I need to create my own life moving forward.
