# The problems of highlighting

The problem with highlighting like one would do in [[Progressive summarization]] is that it is very easy to accumulate these highlights but not process them into [[Evergreens]]. It can be so easy that it can be addicting to simply collect them. But we should [[Avoid collecting information]].

Highlighting as taught by [[thoughts/tiago forte]] encourages information hoarding. It is also time-consuming and expensive to implement (it requires subscriptions to Readwise, Instapaper, and Liner).
