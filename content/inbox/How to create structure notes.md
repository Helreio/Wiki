# How to create structure notes

1. Choose a keyword. For example, [[Zettelkasten]].
2. Browse your slip-box for the best entry points to the keyword. Do not include all relevant [[Evergreens]].
3. Moving forward, strive to [[Link relevant permanent notes to a corresponding structure note]].
4. Before the title, put a symbol that will help you easily locate the structure note. All structure notes will have this symbol before their titles.
