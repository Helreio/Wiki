# Not All Beautiful Things Are True

“Truth” is not always compatible with “beauty.”

This is true for both objective and subjective truths.

Not all true things are beautiful.

And not all beautiful things are true.

Sometimes, believing in something beautiful is believing in fiction.

And sometimes, the only way to uphold truth is to accept that truth is dark and ugly—it’s just the way it is.

There will be times in our lives when we will have to choose which is more important: beauty or truth.

They aren’t “always” together.

We have to choose whether to believe in an ugly truth or to believe in a beautiful lie.
