Creating very specific buyer personas can dramatical ly improve your business results

---

personas: fictional, generalized representations of real people

---

Buyer personas are fictional, generalized representations of your ideal customers. They help you understand your customers (and prospective customers) better, and make it easier for you to tailor content to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different types of buyers.

---

The strongest buyer personas are based on market research as wel l as on insights you gather from your actual customer base–through surveys, interviews, and so on.

---

Depending on your business, you could have as few as one or two personas, or as many as 10 or 20. You can use them to inform everything from writing more effective copy to developing better products.

---

Why Personas Matter to Marketing

---

personas al low you to personalize or target your marketing for different segments of your audience

---

If you take the time to create negative personas–the people that aren’t a great fit for your business -- you’l l have the added advantage of being able to segment out the “bad apples” from the rest of your contacts, which can help you achieve a lower cost- per-lead and cost-per-customer (and see higher sales productivity).

---

When combined with lifecycle stage (i.e. how far along someone is in your sales cycle), buyer personas also al low you to map out and create highly targeted content.

---

Buyer personas are created through research, surveys, and interviews of your target audience. That includes a mix of customers, prospects, and those outside of your contact database who might align with your target audience.

---

Interview customers. Interview customers–and potential customers -- either in person or over the phone, to discover what they like about your product or service. Ask questions about their job role and title, what a typical day-in-the-life looks like (both at work and outside of work), what tools they use in their job, what their chal lenges are, how they learn new information or acquire new skil ls, where they're from, how they search for information on the internet, and so on

---

Look for behavioral trends. Look through your contacts database to uncover trends about how certain leads or customers find and consume your content.

---

Optimize forms for your persona. When creating forms to use on your website, use form fields that capture important persona information.

---

Customers

---

Your existing customer base is the perfect place to start with your interviews, because they've already purchased your product and engaged with your company. At least some of them are likely to exemplify your target persona(s).

---

Reach out to both "good" and "bad" customers. You don't just want to talk to people who love your product and want to spend an hour gushing about you (as good as that feels). Customers who are unhappy with your product wil l show other patterns that wil l help you form a solid understanding of your personas

---

Customers usual ly like being heard, and interviewing them gives them a chance to tel l you about their world, their chal lenges, and what they think of your product. Customers also like to have an impact on the products they use, so you may find that, as you involve them in interviews like this, they become even more loyal to your company. When you reach out to customers, be clear that your goal is to get their feedback and that it's highly valued by your team.

---

Prospects

---

Be sure to balance out your interviews with people who have not purchased your product or know much about your company. Your current prospects and leads are a great option here because you already have their contact information. Use the data you do have about them (i.e. anything you've col lected through lead generation forms or website analytics) to figure out who might fit into your target personas.

---

Referrals

---

You' l l probably also need to rely on some referrals to talk to people who may fit into your target personas, particularly if you're heading into new markets or don't have any leads or customers yet. Reach out to your network–co-workers, existing customers, social media contacts -- to find people you'd like to interview and get introduced to. It may be tough to get a large volume of people this way, but you' l l likely get some very high-quality interviews out of it. If you don't know where to start, try searching on LinkedIn for people who may fit into your target personas and see which results have any connections in common with you. Then reach out to your common connections for introductions.

Third-Party Networks

---

Craigslist al lows you to post ads for people interested in any kind of job, and [UserTesting.com](http://UserTesting.com) al lows you to run remote user testing (with some fol low-up questions).

3 Tips for Recruiting Interviewees

---

Use incentives. While you may not need them in al l scenarios (e.g. customers who already want to talk to you), incentives give people a reason to participate in an interview if they don't have a relationship with you

---

Be clear this isn't a sales cal l. This is especial ly important when dealing with non- customers.

---

Make it easy to say yes. Take care of everything for your potential interviewee. Suggest times, but be flexible; al low them to pick a time right off the bat; and send a calendar invitation with a reminder to block off their time.

---

Role 1) What is your job role? Your title? 2) How is your job measured? 3) What does a typical day look like? 4) What skil ls are required to do your job? 5) What knowledge and tools do you use in your job? 6) Who do you report to? Who reports to you?

---

What level of education did you complete, which schools did you attend, and what did you study? 17) Describe your career path. How did you end up where you are today?

---

Shopping Preferences 18) How do you prefer to interact with vendors (e.g. email, phone, in person)? 19) Do you use the internet to research vendors or products?

The #1 Tip for a Successful Persona Interview The fol low up question to pretty much every question in the above list should be "why?"

---

Through these interviews, you're trying to understand your customers' or potential customers' goals, behaviors, and what drives them. But keep in mind that people are not always great at reflecting on their own behaviors to tel l you what drives them at their core.

---

Start with a simple question–one of our favorites is, "What is your biggest chal lenge?" Then spend a good amount of time diving deeper into that one question to learn more about that person. You learn more by asking "why?" than by asking more superficial questions.

---

The next step is to use your research to identify patterns and commonalities from the answers to your interview questions, develop at least one primary persona, and share that persona with the rest of the company.

---

5. Create a piece of content with a specific persona in mind. Creating buying personas gives you an enhanced knowledge of what your ideal customers like and respond to, as wel l as what they struggle with. Using those insights, you can create a targeted ebook or blog post that solves a common problem–or answers a common question -- that a particular persona has. And if you’ve segmented your contacts list by buyer persona, guess what? You can easily share that piece of content with just the group of contacts who you know wil l be interested in it.

---

6. Audit your existing content for persona alignment. Perform an audit of al l your content and try to figure out which persona each piece aligns with. If you discover content that doesn't align with any of your personas, you might to consider updating it or–if it's had zero success in generating leads -- just get rid of it. At the end of the day, to attract the right people, you need to create the right content.

---

7. Combine personas with lifecycle stages to map out content ideas. In addition to targeting content according to personas, you can target content according to another dimension: lifecycle stage. Lifecycle stage refers to how far along someone is in your sales cycle (and how close they are to making a purchase). By adding this dimension to the mix, you can ensure that you're not only creating the right content for the right people, but that you're also creating it for them at the right time.

---

8. Optimize landing pages for personas. When you offer up a new piece of targeted content, make sure that the accompanying landing page conveys to your persona–in their language -- how that content can help them solve a problem or add value to their lives
