I find that the notion that thinking and meditating, being complete opposites are incompatible. I find this argument weak. After a meditation session, I am able to think clearer, see things through a perspective that was not there before. At the same time, after a hard thinking session, it's almost natural for me to sit, rest, do nothing. At the same time, thinking helps me make more sense of what I experienced thru meditation. The moment I said I experienced.

I think that thinking and meditating lie on one continuum of conscious awareness
