# Frugality and Freedom

I dont have to decide whether or not to espouse frugality. I dont have to philosophize the reason why. I am sure of it and the reason is freedom.

Environmentalism needs to be established.

But this doesn't.

So probably I could start writing about it - frugality and freedom
