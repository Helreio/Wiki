# Cynics

Cynics are the only true walkers among the Greek philosophers. They were vagabonds going from one place to another. This is why the root word of cynic is kunos or dog in Greek. They walk not to teach but to provoke and upset people by behaving and speaking aggressively.

Cynics also wanted to be closer to Nature. But Nature to them was rawness, which explains their behavior. They rejected the public-private dichotomy, insisting that both are still unnatural. The real dichotomy is natural-unnatural. They mock from the perspective of the natural.

Cynicis are in a way ascetics. What is necessary to them is beyong useful. For them, civilization is alienating.

Cynics are the inspiration to hippies.

> The only Greek sages who were authentic walkers were the Cynics, forever on the move, shuffling like vagabonds about the streets. Like dogs. Always rambling from city to city, from public square to public square.

> They did their walking not so much to teach as to provoke and upset. They practised the art of diatribe rather than of predication. They insulted and shocked people with their verbal attacks.

> Just as the Cynic had released the essence of the elemental, so he had subverted the natural. Nature to him was rawness. The raw was Nature on the level of elemental need. Nature, but not the dreamy utopian Nature of a sojourn among quiet truths. The raw is uncivilized Nature, wild and tempestuous, Nature impolite, scandalous, shameless, inhuman. The body functions without reference to conventions or rules.

> The ‘outside’ espoused by the Cynics destabilized the traditional contrast between public and private. The distinction was of interest only to the sedentary: a choice between two closed circles, both shielded from the great outdoors. Private meant the intimacy of family passions, the secrets of desire, the protection of walls, property. Public meant ambition and reputation, the scramble for recognition, the regard of others, social identities.

> But the Cynic was *outside*. And it was from that elsewhere, that exteriority to the world of men, that he could equate low private acts and public vices. It was from that outside that he barracked, mocked and threw together the private and the public as a brace of petty human expedients.

> That is the necessary: an ascetic’s conquest. It is not a question of saying, like the desk-bound philosophers, that you have to be able to detach yourself from all the useless possessions that burden us, but of digging a little deeper, past the useful, down to the necessary. It’s more than frugality: being content with little, being careful. The task here is more arduous, difficult, demanding: to accept only the necessary. This transition takes us well beyond resignation, and leads to the assertion of an absolute sovereignty.
