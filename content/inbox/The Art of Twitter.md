# The Art of Twitter

Who Is Your Audience?

What is my content about? (Page 5)

Jot down broadly what you plan to be writing about. (Page 5)

Who is my target audience? (Page 5)

Based on your topics, you need to ask yourself who the target audience is. (Page 5)

If you’re tweeting about books and book quotes, your target audience is people who like to read. (Page 5)

Of course, you’ll have a general audience as well, but **you need to know who your core audience is. Your real, most engaged group – people who are really interested in your content.** (Page 5)

**Who are the other players in the same market as me?** (Page 5)

**Which influencers are already talking about the same topics that you are? ::You need to know your potential competitors and allies.::** (Page 5)

Setting Yourself Up: Handle, Profile, Picture, and Header Image

if you ever hope to gain a decent sized following in a reasonable timeframe, your account needs to stand out. (Page 7)

Name and Handle

**You want a ::name and handle that reflects the content::that you aim to produce.** (Page 8)

**The ::handle should be congruent to the name::.** This makes it easier for people to remember who you are. (Page 8)

**For the handle, you want to avoid numbers, special characters or anything hard to remember and type.** (Page 8)

It’s far easier to **go with something good from the get-go** than to be stuck with a terrible handle. (Page 9)

If you already have some sort of blog or website that you’re trying to promote, I recommend using the same name. (Page 9)

Should I use my own name/a human name? No. Unless you’re already some sort of well-known public figure, I don’t recommend it at all. (Page 9)

**What if I want to build a personal brand? I would still recommend ::naming your account after your content::. You can ::let your readers know your name via other mediums, such as your website or newsletter or by mentioning it in the header photo::.** (Page 9)

Profile Photo

For a profile photo, you want something that: 1. Communicates what your account is about (Page 10)

You don’t need to reinvent the wheel – many pictures have preexisting brand equity – use it. You can **use well-known images to get yourself an audience first and then change it to something else if you want.** Don’t fall into the trap of “I want to build everything from scratch”. (Page 10)

2. Attention grabbing and interesting (Page 10)

Do not use boring or “common” photos. (Page 10)

You need to stand out from the crowd. (Page 10)

**::Even if you write a great tweet that people like, they are not likely to click on your account to learn more if they think it’s a random viral tweet from a random person.:: They need to know that there’s more where that tweet came from.** (Page 10)

3. Easily identifiable from a distance (Page 10)

I’ve noticed that **::photos with a non-neutral color:: are easy to notice in a hurry. A ::white background works wonders::.** (Page 10)

Should I use my own photo/a photo of my face? I don’t recommend it for the same reasons I don’t recommend using a human name for your account – it reduces the likelihood that people will assume that you’re a random person and not even click your account. (Page 11)

You should also have privacy concerns. In my opinion, it’s not worth being famous at all (especially internet famous) – but take your own call. (Page 11)

If you want to use your own photo, I recommend converting it to a cartoon. (Just Google “face to cartoon convertor” and you’ll find numerous websites that’ll do it for free or cheap.) (Page 11)

they are eye catchy and noticeable from a distance. And you are more likely to click them than if they had been regular photos of a person. (Page 11)

Header Photo

**::The header photo does not matter that much because by the time someone sees it, they are already at your account – so don’t spend too much time thinking about it.:: You can ::use it to communicate more information about yourself::– such as any books or products you’re selling, or a regular photo of yourself if you’re trying to build a personal brand.** (Page 12)

If you’re just starting out, don’t think too much about it. Just throw in a header that is relevant to your content and move on. You can always change it up later. (Page 12)

Bio

If you want them to follow you – you need a sales pitch. **Your bio is that sales pitch – the idea you’re selling is “you should follow my account”.** (Page 12)

**::Answer the question, “Here is why you should follow me” / “This is the kind of content I produce”:::** This will tell people what you are about, prompting them to click “follow” if they’re interested in that type of content. (Page 12)

**Do NOT talk about yourself in the bio.** Nobody gives a fuck about you. (Page 12)

**::They care about how you can help them. Use the bio to answer that question::.** (Page 12)

By the way, I also recommend staying away from hashtags in your bio. It looks really spammy and unprofessional. (Page 12)

A **link to his Instagram page and books is good**. Helps his audience find him in other places. (Page 16)

The header image is good – it tells us about his background and has a photo of him (good for a personal brand). (Page 17)

![skitch 2.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/2A6B8DAA-1BE1-46D1-AA19-545B3DA5F1BF_2/skitch%202.png)

Note: **Don’t leave lines in your bio.** It does not show up well on the mobile apps. Instead, use | to separate things. (Page 18)

![skitch 3.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/969B918F-8B37-4E97-91AB-D51F69E2742E_2/skitch%203.png)

**The location info should be changed to “Join my newsletter:” (to bring attention to the link right next to it).** (Page 20)

When you’re reaching a global audience, using local abbreviations is a bad idea. (Page 20)

1. Make the background of the photo white. 2. Rewrite the bio from scratch – give information about your content, not you. 3. Change location information. No one cares about where you live. (Page 21)

![skitch 4.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/2E421D0A-44DF-477A-8E96-B5C0DE8B430E_2/skitch%204.png)

**I would change the account name to “Steve Burns | Trading, Money, Financial Freedom” – giving his name and some info about the account.** (Page 23)

Growing Your Account: Strategies that Don’t Work

**Going from 0 to 5,000 is the hardest part of the journey – it takes the longest time, requires the most effort, and has the highest quit rate.** If you follow the strategy outlined in the next chapter, **I don’t think it should take you longer than 4-6 months to get to 2,000 – a good basic starter audience.** (Page 26)

Social Media Compound Interest

![skitch 5.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/7BEE9E7E-A5D2-4C75-B663-20183B62700B_2/skitch%205.png)

you will see your growth per month speed up as your account grows bigger and more people see and share your content. (Page 26)

**This can be very slow at first – so don’t have unreasonable expectations and don’t get disheartened that things aren’t moving at the rate you expect them to.** (Page 26)

Things That Don’t Work

1. Follow for follow

**I recommend following less than 100 people or 1% of your audience size, whichever is larger.** This signals that you’re a serious account who got his following with good content, not return follows. (Page 27)

2. Spamming hashtags

**I recommend avoiding hashtags altogether.** (Page 27)

3. Tweeting to thin air
4. Starting fights and creating drama
5. Tagging larger accounts and hoping on steroids
6. Tweeting a 100 times a day

**You are far better off producing smaller amounts of high-quality content** (Page 28)

rather than an unending sludge of random tweets. (Page 29)

our strategy is far more reasonable – **we’ll ::only be tweeting a dozen or so times a day at best – but our tweets will be far more productive.::** (Page 29)

7. Paying for retweets

**I don’t recommend spending any money on promotions such as these until your account has started making you money.** Learning to grow from nothing is an important part of the journey that will teach you a lot about writing and even psychology. Don’t try to skip the journey here. (Page 29)

---

Strategy: From 0 to 5,000 Followers

At this stage, we are going to be **tweeting about ::15 - 20 times a day, some days a few more, and on some days a few less::.** However, **::only 3 - 5 tweets will be normal tweets::. (Normal tweet means a tweet that is not a reply.) ::The rest of the tweets will be replies to other large accounts, preferably in the same space as you. These replies need to be high-quality tweets that add to the discussion, not spammy replies.::** (Page 30)

![skitch 6.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/9B5A271B-1223-48FA-8581-FEBBE57A126E_2/skitch%206.png)

![skitch 7.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/75F8853F-9919-4D15-AE7E-3586581804A8_2/skitch%207.png)

![skitch 8.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/2D902CDC-2196-44AA-8F1A-2E03EED605E1_2/skitch%208.png)

![skitch 9.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/5A06771A-F0DD-47EC-904B-32B2E44D930F_2/skitch%209.png)

There are plenty of large accounts such as this one – * ::find the ones that fit into the type of content you plan to produce. Even if they don’t fit your content exactly, you can still use them occasionally to get some eyes on you.::* If your reply is very good, you might even be retweeted by the large account themselves! (Page 32)

**You also want to ::retweet your own reply::so your audience can see it i.e. leave a reply, and then retweet your reply. This way, you also produce content for your audience, as well as get more followers from other people’s.** (Page 32)

**::Remember to not spam a few people too much::, lest you get blocked for being a parasite.** You can also **do some quote tweets if you like – they are similar to normal tweets in their potential to bring you new followers.** (Page 32)

By the way – Twitter is a fast-moving place. A tweet becomes as good as dead after 24 hours. **::You want to be as quick as possible with your reply::when you’re replying to someone with millions of followers – ideally set up the notification bell and reply within minutes.** (Page 32)

We won’t be using any automation tools at this stage, largely because **when you are this small – you need to be on the platform, tweeting and interacting with people. You need to create your place on the platform, and you need to be there yourself. I recommend checking Twitter every two hours or so for new tweets to reply to.** (Page 32)

![skitch 10.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/D86BEDF6-6223-40D1-95BE-DB6A23A6F134_2/skitch%2010.png)

Strategy: From 5,000 to 10,000 Followers

Now that we are at 5000, we have a pretty good audience base set up. It means we can take it easy with the checking Twitter every 2 hours to reply to people thing and focus on creating more content for our existing followers. We will still be doing replies, but only 5-6 a day instead of 10-15. (Replies are a great way to get new eyes to your content, no matter how large your account is.) (Page 34)

We will increase our normal tweet count from about 3-5 to more along the lines of 7-10 per day. This is because we already have an inbuilt audience who will read our content, and like and retweet it and bring us more followers. Remember, even a like can bring you more followers too because sometimes Twitter will show the liker’s followers that they have liked X tweet... (Page 34)

…and that will bring you more eyes. (Page 34)

Don’t forget to retweet your tweets

You should retweet your tweets up to 2-3 times in the week you post them so they can get more exposure and impressions. (Page 34)

Personally, I retweet the tweets I post in the day at night, and I retweet the tweets that were posted in the night (by automation software as I slept) during the day. (Page 34)

Do not be shy – you may feel that your audience may get annoyed seeing the same tweet again and again, but I assure you, they do not. In fact, for most of them, they’ll only be seeing it once or twice. (Page 34)

The biggest change that we’ll bring in our 5000-10000 strategy is that we’ll add in automation. Instead of posting all of our tweets manually, we’ll be using software to post some tweets for us. (Page 34)

You are likely generating some money from your Twitter account by now, so I recommend paying for a full feature automation software – they can be worth their weight in gold. (Page 35)

We will be using software to post tweets in the time we sleep i.e. we will be using software so our tweets can target audiences on the other side of the world, who are awake when we are asleep. You want to do at least 2-3 tweets in your “sleep” to get more traction with that side of the world. You can even do threads in this range – threads can go popular and bring you a lot of followers. (Page 35)

Threads were not a good idea when you were lower than 5k because there was a much lower chance of it becoming popular (as there was no built-in audience to promote it) – but you have that audience now. (Page 35)

I recommend logging in and checking Twitter every 3-4 hours at least. (Page 35)

![skitch 11.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/4341FA19-87DB-4332-89F5-9E61B745FE23_2/skitch%2011.png)

---

Strategy: From 10,000 Followers and Beyond

You should find yourself at 10,000 within 18 months at max, and it’s likely that you’ll get there by the 12-month mark if you follow the strategy we outlined before (assuming your content is not too niche). (Page 36)

At this point, we are large enough to grow completely organically; in other words, we can lay off the replying game at this point. Simply create 5 – 10 normal tweets a day, most of which you can automate. I typically post 3-4 automated tweets each day containing new content and 1-2 tweets manually. When I’m busy, I don’t even do the manual tweets; it’s all automated. The automated tweets are evenly spaced out through the day allowing me to target a global audience. (Page 36)

You could do more replies to boost growth, but frankly, it’s quite unnecessary – you’ve already completed the hard part – you’ve created a self-sustaining audience. Now you can sit back, automate everything, and watch your account grow. (Page 36)

![skitch 12.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/BE81F724-C932-476F-8A79-0BF916D34C4C_2/skitch%2012.png)

Creating Better Tweets: Get More Engagement Per Tweet

**1. ::Break the tweet up into separate lines::**: (Page 37)

![skitch 13.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/EBF7D55C-1F80-42DB-8EA2-7FE7E4BE129A_2/skitch%2013.png)

Remember, **people are not on Twitter particularly to read your content. They are there often because they are bored and need to fiddle with something for a few minutes.** They rapidly scroll the timeline and do not want to expend effort to read paragraphs. (Page 37)

**It is your job as a writer to ::make it as easy as possible for people to consume your content::. Don’t make it a paragraph, space your content out, make it easy to consume, and get directly to the point.** Remember, people do not read Twitter as they read book. They lazily skim tweets until they see something easy to read and they read just that. **Make sure your content does not require too much focus / effort on the part of the reader.** (Page 37)

**::2. Use lists and green checkmarks:::** (Page 38)

![skitch 14.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/250DEA24-3E04-4F9D-BF5A-81AD890EC9A1_2/skitch%2014.png)

![skitch 15.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/FB3D38DF-58A5-42A1-A54A-508FD39ED6F3_2/skitch%2015.png)

The idea is the same as before – make the content easier to read and easier to spot for someone who is quickly scrolling the timeline. **The green checkmark makes your content very easy to see among a sludge of text-only posts. It also makes it more likely for people to press the like button for whatever reason.** (Page 38)

**Don’t overdo it though** – some people find this trick and keep doing it over and over again, making all of their posts look very spammy. (Page 38)

**You can also use emojis to draw attention to the central point of your tweet.** (Page 38)

**3. Use negativity to your advantage**: (Page 39)

point out the negative perspective of things. (Page 39)

![skitch 16.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/CFB06440-6685-49BC-B2F9-1FC2F27BC9D6_2/skitch%2016.png)

This is a classic **“you/also you” style tweet** that I frequently do. I could frame it from a positive perspective, “If you want more energy and alertness…” but that won’t bring me nearly as much engagement.

**A tweet from a negative perspective, on the other hand, gets people to click. It just engages the limbic system more.** (Page 40)

![skitch 17.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/BA944E07-0766-4005-87FC-7CAA3DD32EDD_2/skitch%2017.png)

Of course, **don’t go around being negative in every post you make. But know that you can use it to boost engagement every once in a while.** (Page 40)

**Tweet frequently. At least a few times a day.** This keeps the momentum going. The **Twitter algorithm loves consistency**. (Page 41)

**Throw in an image tweet occasionally, but don’t spam images. Images get more clicks, but fewer retweets.** (Page 41)

**Interact with other accounts in your space – boost them, and they’ll often return the favor.** (Page 41)

As you spend time on Twitter, you will figure out what type of writing works for your particular type of content – don’t stress it, just go and try new things. (Page 41)

Monetization

You can sell your own products, you can sell other people’s products, you can take in donations, you can run collaborative advertisements for companies, etc. (Page 42)

What do I need to start monetizing my Twitter account? A product that your audience is interested in, a PayPal account (useful in most cases) and a bank account. (Page 42)

**How many followers do you recommend I start monetizing at? I would say anywhere between 2,000 to 5,000 makes a good starting point.** The more, the merrier, but you can start to see some money at 2,000 followers. (Page 42)

Does making money off of my Twitter account make me a sellout? Only if you sell scummy products hoping to make a quick buck. There’s nothing wrong with selling – just **make sure what you’re selling is useful to the buyer and that you’ve tried and tested what you’re selling.** (Page 42)

Personally, **I only affiliate market products I personally like and use.** (Page 42)

Affiliate Marketing

**Start with all the products and services that you already use – which of them could be relevant to your audience?** (Page 42)

Amazon Associates

Amazon Associates is Amazon’s affiliate program – I recommend signing up for it because a large number of products are available only via amazon. (Page 43)

**Amazon needs you to sign up locations. Go to** [**analytics.twitter.com**](http://analytics.twitter.com)** and see where your audience is located in. Then sign up for the top 2-3 locations of those. individually for different** (Page 43)

Remember that Amazon needs you to disclose that you’re an affiliate when you put up links – so don’t forget to do that. (Page 43)

**Affiliate links need to be retweeted 2-3 times to reach most of your audience – and make sure you retweet it at different times of the day so people in different time zones are targeted.** (Page 43)

**One other thing you need to make sure is that you are selling products that are relevant to your audience.** (Page 43)

Selling Your Own Products

The real money is in selling your own products. (Page 44)

**When you sell your own products, make sure you create some sort of affiliate program for your audience as well – this gives them affiliate opportunities and helps you scale your income.** (Page 44)

unless you have a specific reason to not use Gumroad, **go with Gumroad** (Page 44)

**For your own products – leave the link in the pinned tweet and bio so everyone in your audience can see it.** (Page 45)

![skitch 18.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/A3EE5704-634A-4002-A740-3BC63A9AC86C_2/skitch%2018.png)

![skitch 19.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/DB20476B-41FB-4983-85A5-F836507735B4/2CA66409-80CC-4383-940F-606D504F3B55_2/skitch%2019.png)

Selling Services

Donations

**I don’t recommend accepting donations**, by the way. It makes you look bad and it doesn’t make a lot of money. Remember – **people are not on Twitter to spend money. They may buy something from you, but it is much less likely that they will just give you their money as a donation.** (Page 46)

Very few people donate anything, and it’s not worth the time and reputation to ask for donations. I don’t think this is a good monetization model and I don’t recommend it. (Page 46)

Selling Retweets

**Once you are a bigger account, you can consider selling retweets to help other accounts grow.** I’ve never done it, but it’s a fairly obvious and easy business that a lot of people are in. (Page 47)

Recommended Roadmap: Monetization

**Don’t do any monetization till you reach 2000 followers. There’s just not a lot of money to be made until that point and you don’t want to annoy whatever small audience you have.** (Page 47)

**Once you are at 2-5k, start selling some affiliate products.** It could be anything that is relevant to your audience. Learn what works best for your content type – **hard sell tweets, a link under a thread, a link to your website article, etc. This will teach you copywriting, as you will get a lot of feedback per tweet.** (Page 47)

**Don’t overdo the sales tweets. Only post a product related tweet after 7-10 normal tweets. This way, you do not annoy your audience with excessive promotion.** (Page 47)

**Retweet your marketing tweets at different times and make the tweets at different times. You don’t want to do all the product tweets around the same time of day because then only one time-zone of people see it. You want to mix it up – if you tweeted once in the morning, retweet it again in the night.** This way, most people only see your marketing tweet once, and most of your audience gets to see it. (Page 47)

**As you gain some experience with selling and make a few bucks for yourself, start working on a product.** Create something – anything. The first product I sold was a pdf compilation of my newsletters and I sold it for $4.99 – it didn’t make me a lot of money, but it did help me test the market. (Page 47)

**I think you should create your first product as early as you can (after getting some affiliate marketing experience), instead of waiting for 10k or X followers. It doesn’t have to be a big product or an expensive product – just something that you can sell to people who want to buy from you.** (Page 47)

Also – **for any product you create and sell, leave a link in the pinned tweet!** (Page 47)

How to Avoid Getting Banned

READ THE TWITTER RULES! (Page 48)

Making threats, even in a friendly way. (Page 48)

Condoning or encouraging violence and genocides. (Page 48)

We define glorification to include praising, celebrating, or condoning statements, such as “I’m glad this happened”, “This person is my hero”, “I wish more people did things like this”, or “I hope this inspires others to act”. (Page 48)

Sharing other people’s private information or threatening to share other people’s private information. (Page 48)

Tweets wishing for harm upon someone (Page 48)

Encouraging people to harass someone. (Page 48)

Replying to someone (including quote tweets) with sexual insults (Page 48)

**My recommendation to avoid getting banned is desisting from having negative interactions with individuals. If you don’t like someone, just block them.** (Page 48)

No point interacting with a 5-follower account only to risk your 5000-follower account. Negative people are not worth the time anyway. (Page 48)

A Guide to Networking

as you seriously grow your account and spend more time on Twitter, you will grow a soft network with other people in the space. (Page 49)

This will happen naturally as you reply to other people’s tweets. They will notice it. They will sometimes like and retweet it, they will interact with you, they will follow you back, etc. (Page 49)

If it happens enough, **you will eventually start interacting with people via DMs – just send them a “hi” and introduce yourself.** (Page 49)

**Do not ask for favors or a follow back or retweets – it only makes you look parasitic.** (Page 49)

And **stay in your league – if you have 2,000 followers, you are not going to get interactions with someone who has 50,000** – you are just too small for him. (Page 49)

However, someone with 4,000 followers will be happy to interact with you – so interact with them. **Build some friendships and alliances, and don’t overshoot too much. You will grow together, just like how real life alliances work.** (Page 49)

**I’d draw the upper limit at 10x your own follower count. So if you have 20k followers, you can try to interact with someone who has 200k, but you will have more success with people in the 0-50k bracket.** (Page 49)

It’s just how it is – **people who are big on twitter understand the game and they will not entertain you if you’re too small for them to get any followers by interacting with you on a consistent basis.** (Page 49)

That’s all there is to networking online – **get noticed by your content quality, talk to people in your “size range”, help each other out, and don’t be parasitic** – just how it works in real life. (Page 49)

Creating Completely Passive Accounts

This is a side business idea that you can start once you get some followers on your main twitter account. **I recommend getting into it once you hit 10k (before that you’ll be too busy growing your main account).** (Page 50)

You need to **find a book, person or something that people are interested in, and you need to take up quotes from the book and fill up your queue with it. I recommend at least 500-1000 tweets and the bot should tweet 3-4 each day.** I recommend using a software called **SmarterQueue** for this. (Page 50)

**Once you have the content set up in the schedule – make the account go live and just retweet the tweets from your main account to give the new one some exposure.** If the book or person is popular and interesting enough, you’ll find that people will follow your new account. (Page 50)

**Throw in some affiliate and product tweets among the normal mix of tweets, and you’ve got yourself a nice side business going on!** It’s a major win-win because people get new information and content and you make some extra cash. (Page 50)

**It sends about 8-9 normal tweets, followed by a product tweet.** I made it once, and now it brings me money in sales and commissions every single month for doing nothing. (Page 50)

Purely passive once it’s set up, I retweeted it a few times to get the follow count up to 5000, and then it’s grown on its own for the most part. (Page 51)

I also created [bookofpook.com](http://bookofpook.com) – I link the long form chapters as tweets and get some extra visitors from Google. At this size, this bot makes me around $400 a month, in pure passive income. It has 844 tweets set up, out of which 770 are quotes, 71 are article links, and 3 of them are product links. I’ll be adding more products to the mix soon – including links to this guide! (Can you see how everything feeds into each other?) (Page 51)

Many such bots already exist, so make sure you start something new. This space is almost entirely unexplored, so no point competing with other people. (Page 51)

Do new things, create new content, add value to people, make some money, and more importantly – have fun – **if you’re not having fun, you’re doing the social media business wrong (it’s very easy to get burnt out)**. (Page 51)

Appendix A: What do I tweet about? What topics should I pick?

My main advice to you is to **not niche yourself down too much.** If you start talking about something very specific, say learning Chinese for Swahili speakers, the number of people looking for that information is too small for anything to ever be viable. (Page 52)

**Keep your main topics general and broad and talk about things you already know.** (Page 52)

it’s very hard to grow when you’re the same as everyone else. There’s no point faking expertise – you WILL grow tired of it. (Page 52)

**If you are still learning, show your growth. People like hones** ty and if you can honestly show them that you are trying, they will be interested in you. (Page 52)

**So give your own unique perspective on what you already know, and if you don’t know anything, learn and write about your journey.** (Page 52)

DO NOT copy and paste (or reword) other people’s content. Be original, and do not be ultra-niched, and you’ll do just fine! (Page 52)
