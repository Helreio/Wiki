# Evergreen note-taking system

Here is the workflow of [[Andy Matuschak]]'s reimagining of [[Zettelkasten]] for the Internet age.

- Andy picks prompts and incomplete notes from his [[writing inbox]].
- Develop the note into an [[Evergreen notes]].
   - Example of Evergreen notes in stages of development:
      - Stubs implicitly defined through backlinks (Note: I do not yet understand this at the moment. See: https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Taxonomy_of_note_types)
      - Simple definitions for terms from the literature
      - Precise, narrow declarative notes
      - Higher-level APIs
         - Notes abstracting over many other notes
         - Personal definition of terms
   - Develop a good title
      - Use complete phrases as note titles to maintain concept-orientation.
      - Use questions as note titles to pressure you to get to the core of the matter. But the goal is to drop the question mark eventually
   - Link note to other Evergreen notes
      - While writing the note, you will create new phrases that will become new notes. Create a page for these notes then include them in your Writing Inbox.

To do

- Write this note as a brief description of Andy’s system. Do not use it as the reference for your own system.
