# Minimum Viable Worldview

The universe is made up of an indivisible particle.

(It has to, if it should conform to logic)

These particles make up forms (what we call “objects”)

Forms however are not metaphysical existents.

There are no true boundaries between these forms.

They are concepts.

Everything is made up of one indivisible particle and it is the only “thing” that truly exists.

The boundaries between forms, therefore forms themselves, are simply artificial. They depend on the mind for existence.

We do not live in a world of objects.

We live in a world of concepts.

Is consciousness a product of particles?

Is its existence dependent on “matter”?

Logically speaking, consciousness could not exist without the brain.

But the brain is also an apparent form therefore a concept that relies on consciousness for it to exist.

Analysis on origins should start with the first life form.

I would argue that the most elementary of life forms possessed consciousness (or a better word) because without it, it won’t survive, it won’t be able to navigate forms around him.

So I think both particle and consciousness is basic and fundamental in the universe.

2 fundamental parts of the universe

1. Physical particle
2. Spirit

But which came first?

West: some divisions are artificial but some are real. Some existents have independent existence.

East: all divisions are artificial. All existents are created by the mind.

2 choices

1. Everything is one and the self is illusory.
2. Everything is not-one and we live in a world of souls.
