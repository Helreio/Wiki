# Create a Life Worth Living Exercises

**Thinker Exercise**

If you are a thinker in search of the right working situation, then let your mental habits lead you to some new ideas. Go to a library and **look through biographies of people you admire.** **Look at the course of their careers and how they found jobs that served their creative ambitions.** Make a list of your favorite creative thinkers and their jobs. Now sit and write a list of the jobs you think will keep you in a constant state of curiosity and intellectual challenge.

Put the list in the exercises of chapter 6 for future use.

**Generator Exercise**

Make a list of all the projects you’d like to do. Pick one of your smallest, simplest ideas and execute it from start to finish.

As you increase your belief in the power of your own action, you will be able to juggle more projects and finish them. As you work through this singular project, write all your competing ideas down on a single list.

Put the list as a bookmark in the exercises in chapter 6 for future use.

**Mystic Exercise**

Make a list of the essences you want to bring into your life. Create a ritual (or perhaps an invented beverage) that symbolically incorporates all these essences. Perform this ritual with the intention of imbibing your new life into your body. Okay, now that you feel truly transported, meditate on the perfect situation for your career and creative woes. At the end of the meditation, write down your ideas and put the list in the exercises section of chapter 6 as a bookmark.

**Inventor Exercise**

Invent a job description of your ideal work. Then spend a free day pretending you have that job. Simulate the experience from the environment to the task to your interaction with other people. Spend the entire day in this self-invented life. At the end of the day, write down all the ideas for working situations that you thought of over the course of the day. Pick the best of them and begin it.

Now put the list of ideas in the exercise section of chapter 6 as a bookmark.

**Teacher Exercise**

Draw up a lesson plan for one hour of the most wonderful class in the world. It doesn’t have to be a class that exists, you can invent it. What are you going to be teaching? How will you begin the class? How will you structure it? What will the students be doing? What will your role be? Once you have a clear picture of this class through a complete lesson plan, then determine the size, setting, and audience for the class. Make a list of three possible places you could teach this class — if only on a voluntary basis.

Now put this exercise as a bookmark in the exercises of chapter 6, where you will be able to use the information again.

**Healer Exercise**

If you are a healer and you want to refocus your creativity toward an individual, self-generated project, then try making the outcome of the project be a gift for a friend or family. This deadline and clarity of motivation can give you the impetus to create. If you have a lonely grandmother or a tortured teenage grandson and you are a poet, write poetry just for them. If you are a budding entrepreneur, write a business plan for a company that will help a specific person in your community. Write a list of the creative projects you can do that would support your creative aspirations through your impulse toward service and giving.

Put that list as a bookmark in the exercises at the end of chapter 6 for future use.

In writing, I think and generate ideas usually personal and with a social implication. I invent my own concepts. Then teach these with a purpose of healing people through words when published.

**Obstacles**

Make a list of the things you perceive as the main obstacles to achieving the above goals. Include internal issues and nuts-and-bolts problems.

Look over your list. Do your concerns touch on money, stability, or time? Do you have any judgements about whether or not you should even have these concerns?

List

- Laziness
- Choosiness in choosing paid work
- Indecisiveness (having too many ideas, can’t decide which to pursue)
- Money
- Shyness and discomfort in reaching out to people

**Questions on Worldly Needs**

Exactly how much money per year do I need to make?

I need to make 20,000-30,000 per month or 240,000-360,000 a year to have enough and then some.

What kind of housing situation do I require?

I don’t need my own house, at least for now. All I need is a private space where I can work every day with my ideas.

What form of transportation do I need to use?

Commute. I don’t have any plans in getting a car. A bicycle is enough.

How much time do I need to develop and maintain my art?

Ideally, I want to work on my art at least 3-4 hours every day.

What kinds of recreation and companionship do I need?

I just have to play and rest. Anything will do.

Video games

Movies

Getting outside

Travelling once in a while

I don’t have to spend too much in recreation

My happiness comes from my thoughts and my ideas and my art

I need a few close people in my life.

My girlfriend and a few really close friends is enough.

My desire is also to have friends who are in a similar boat - spiritual, service-oriented, and creative.

What kind of respect, love, and sense of purpose must I have to fulfill my ethical, political, and spiritual life?

I just want to feel part of a cause and community of like-minded people. I want to feel camaraderie again. I don’t have to be intimate with this people. I just want to be friends with them, to know them, and be with them once in a while.

Questions on Money

How little money would you be happy to earn if you were doing work that you absolutely loved?

- 20,000 or less. I can live up to 10,000 or less.

How much money would you want to earn if you had a full-time job that you didn’t find creative?

- 30,000 or above (the bigger the better)

Is there any amount of money that could buy your creative time away from you?

- None. Because if I earn that money, I will make sure that it will buy my creative time back.

If you had “enough” money coming in would you be tempted to live above your means?

- Maybe. But odds are low. I rather have more time and freedom than more fancy things and experiences.

Do you use extra money to put aside time for your creative work, or does money end up taking away your time (in the form of shopping, bar-hopping, and so on)?

- I definitely use money to put aside time for creative work.

If you had five million dollars, what would that mean for your creative work?

- That means I will do everything necessary to never work again in my entire life. I will invest in myself and my art. I will make sure I give primary importance to my art, myself, and my true calling.

How do you feel about asking to be paid for your creative work? Does it feel different from getting a paycheck from a job you don’t like?

- It can feel a little different because at least you don’t have to endure all those hours you don’t like to spend doing something you don’t like to do.
- But now that money is involved, it is still not pure unattached art. You are serving other people and other people have a say on how the work is going to end.

Questions on Time

How much time do you need for creative work?

- 3-4 hours every day
- Entire morning
- An hour in the afternoon
- An hour in the evening

How much time do you need for resting and replenishing your imagination?

- I feel like rest and creation comes together. I don’t want them to be distinct. One fuels the other. They are both part of this thing called creativity.
- I give time for rest, leisure, and play in almost equal quantity with that which I give my creativity. Around 3 hours a day.

How much time do you need for your basic human needs: sleep, food, cleaning, and exercise?

- Sleep: 6 hours
- Food: 3 hours
- Cleaning: 1 hour
- Exercise: 1 hour

How much time do you need for socializing? Family time? Alone time?

- Socializing - I can and want to stay by myself. I can socialize for a few hours a week.
- Family Time - A few hours a month
- Alone Time - I’m alone most of the time

How do you spend your most creative hours of the day?

- Learning
- Reading
- Writing
- Designing
- Thinking

Is there anything that you “don’t have enough time for” only because you misconstrue how much time it actually requires?

What activities in your life do you consistently overestimate in terms of their need for time?

What activities do you consistently underestimate in terms of their need for time?

Are you often late? Are you late for certain kinds of activities and not for others?

- I am usually late when I am meeting someone.
- I have a less tendency to be late on things I really value.

Do you make deadlines? Are you more likely to make a deadline for a job than a creative project?

- I make deadlines for both. But more with a job. I want the purest creative projects to take their time and space to come true.

What are your innate inclinations?

Movement

Stillness

6

4

My innate inclination is to move (thought-wise) but I easily get overwhelmed and my stillness radar is so sensitive it can easily tell me to stop.

People

Solitude

3

7

My radar for detecting increased numbers of time alone is not that strong so I really tend to forsake time with friends and people. I do crave for community too. But I do my best work when I am alone.

Nature

Culture

Details

Generalities

Product

Process

2

8

I want to feel good doing something. I also want to have something to show to people. But the process, being in the moment, is more important to me.

Routine

Sporadic

5

5

There is a constant struggle between the two every day. I need variety every day so I change a lot of my routine. But I still have a routine so I can feel in control and grounded. I can feel like a robot doing the same thing for a long time so I intentionally change my routines though.

Contemplation

Action

9

1

Action is my number one weakness which was heightened after I got depressed. I am more lazy now than before. I tend to have lots of ideas but can’t put them to action or can’t finish them.

Communication

Analysis

4

6

I can communicate thoughts and ideas through writing. Speaking can be a little challenging. However, I am better when I am just thinking things through.

Individual

Group

8

2

I work poorly with a group. I can lead like I lead before but no longer as efficient. I work better when I am by myself and I can lead but through example.

- A community of like-minded people.
- A part-time source of income.
- A healthier and happier lifestyle.
- A thriving creative career.
- Travel and adventure.

The Three Paths

1. Book-centered writing career (thought leader)
2. Blog-centered writing career (teacher or infopreneur)

---

**Indie Multi-topic Book Author and Thought Leader**

If from this hour forward you devote your life to this path and only this path, what do you want to accomplish in...

One Year

- A part-time job
- A good location + environment that inspires creativity
- A community of like-minded people who will propel me to continue in my project
- A well-brainstormed plan for my first book (or two)

Five Years

- Published my 2 books
- I have both done them through self publishing
- I am currently working with an agent to try out traditional publishing
- Publishing one of my books lead to speaking engagements
- I have been thinking about teaching some of my concepts in the form of workshops or one-on-one mentorship programs

Ten Years

- I have published 5 books
1. A book about jobs and money
2. A book about inner work and social change
3. My memoir
4. A book of poems and written prayers
5. An interview compilation
- I have done both self-publishing and traditional publishing
- I am working with one on one clients for some concepts on my book
- I am traveling around the Philippines and some parts of the world for speaking engagements
- I have partnered with an NGO to bring some of my concepts to life
- I continue to live in my simple idea lab where I enjoy this process of thinking about things and having a say about them in a freedom-filled environment.

Where would you need to live?

I need to live:

- Somewhere I have privacy.
- Somewhere near nature.
- Somewhere near a library and a coffee shop (a small city perhaps).
- Somewhere where I can have coffee with a few friends.
- Somewhere where I can have a desk and am surrounded by reference books and other materials that inspire me.

Advantages of this life

- True to my strength of uncovering stories, thinking, generating ideas, and writing.
- True to my preference of being alone and doing my work in solitude.

Disadvantages of this life

- Solitude can make me disconnected with people for long periods of time.
- To be heard and read by more people, I need to do the difficult and sometimes uncomfortable job of “marketing” and “selling” my work.
- Books are longer than articles. They may need discipline to finish. -> But I can take each chapter an article.

You are on your deathbed looking back. How do you feel?

Fulfilled because I have fully expressed myself in the medium I am most honest with - the written word.

I may have some regrets of an unfinished or unrealized book idea.

Or I may have some regrets because I have not put wheels on my ideas but my pleasure will be from:

1. Experiencing this expression and playing with ideas.
2. Giving birth to these books that can be read by the next generation.

What personality traits does this life cultivate in you?

- Self-expression
- Solitude
- Simple living
- Art

If you were to dedicate yourself to this plan tomorrow, what would be your short-term goals?

One month

First, I will establish a part-time job. Then I will plot a career plan to follow. Perhaps looking for mentors whose lives I can study.

Three months

By now, I have a part-time day job that allows me to play and cultivate my ideas on the side. I also have a flexible and open-minded plan to move into my career.

The next logical thing to be doing is to start working on one of my book ideas (or two so I don’t get bored). I’ll start with the book idea that really inspires me and do the work of researching, designing the book, and writing it.

Six months

By six months, I am almost nearing half of my initial work with my book which involves brainstorming and all.

I have joined a community of aspiring book authors to keep me accountable and not to feel so alone in doing this project.

What are the feelings evoked from writing out this plan right now?

I need to make it a little bit more exciting

If your plan isn’t immediately lucrative, how will you earn a living in the process?

I will freelance write.

Analyzing Your Plans

If you had to step out onto one of these roads tomorrow, which one would you choose?

Which one in your dark secret core excites you the most?

Which one do you feel willing to act on?

If none of them thrills you singularly, does some combination of the three pique your interest? If so, when you combine these interests, which one is the most important to you?

Which path would you ideally make your priority?

Is there a way that one of these plans can pay your way as you develop another more heartfelt path?

If no combination works for you, are there any insights you can bring to your not choosing? What do you gain by not choosing?

Are you not letting yourself think big enough? Are you thinking so big it depresses you?

Are you fulfilling someone else’s dreams for yourself rather than your own?

Multiple Topics

Personal + Academic

What to blog about?

I really don’t want to bring people to my process.

I just want to do the process and lifestyle stuff - travel, interview, be with nature...

Then what I want to show to people is what I want to show to them.

I don’t have to show everything.

I just have to show what feels good to show.

As I write and create what feels good to create.

Creating Your Goal

A good goal is:

- Something you can imagine.
- Something you really would love to do.
- Something specific.
- Should represent the first milestone in your most important arena of creative pursuit.

**Choose a goal with a time line of somewhere between one year and five years.**

Write your goal, time line, means of financial support, and desire.

Once you have written down your goal, go over it with a friend. Ask them if they think you are underestimating yourself or being overly ambitious. Make sure this friend is someone you completely trust, someone who has no competitive feelings toward you and thinks very highly of your abilities. If you can’t trust any of your friends, by all means keep your goal a secret and begin looking around for a person with whom you can cultivate a supportive creative friendship.

What to do after deciding your five arenas

1. Discuss them with your partner (in your third session).
2. Begin to fill out the calendar.
3. Concentrate on larger goals rather than daily or even weekly tasks.
4. Keep each of your goals lined up in the column underneath its arena.
5. Post the calendar near your creative work space and use it to keep yourself aware of deadlines before they creep up on you, and to get a feel for the arc of your progress.
6. After two months, bring your calendar back to your partner and fill in as much of the next few months of goals, deadlines, and aspirations as you can.
