I accept this fact

This experience

This memory

As part and parcel of what I will carry in my brain now and in the following nows.

It will be easier eventually, yes.

But as long as eventually isn’t happening yet, acceptance will happen.

I accept this. I will be bothered. I will be disturbed. I will be slowed down. But I will not reject it. It will be part of my journey. I won’t let it stop me from doing the things I want to do, my other children. But this too is my child. And thus I will allow it to stay here, give it the emotions it needs.

Until whenever it is ready to let me be by myself.
