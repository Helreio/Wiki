# Perhaps the most important take away I got from Reality is Broken is gamifying life to live it happily.

And one way to make it happier is instant gratification.

As much as I want to write and create stuff, these are long arduous isolating processes. I need to balance these with processes that involve more person to person interactions, where feedback is more direct.

Contribution is a value I know is important but I neglected it. I now see that it contributes to my general well-being and I need to do something about it.
