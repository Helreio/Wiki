# Plot ideas

**World**

Set in a made up world, inspired by Philippine geography.

Social classes and organization is inspired by ancient Filipino society

A diverse world. A plural society. Conflict. The place of the individual in all of these.

The world is flat.

The islands are grouped in circles.

The outer reaches of the circle is where the invaders come from.

The middle islands is where the ili of our protagonist is placed.

The inner island is where the utopian society is located. It is full of mystery.

Explorers go in the big island. Not out.

In his journey, the closer he is to the inner islands, the deeper he understands who he really is.

The inner islands are actually a cluster of smaller islands instead of one monolithic island.

But the residents of the island come from the same lineage.

A rule of the ancient society (a mandala - pares inter pares) is that less population is better. The spirit is created and recreated but it has to be cultivated by those alive

**Society**

Societal level

- Meaningful difference and separation
- But interconnection and interrelationship

Individual level

- Deep knowledge of the self

**The Protagonist**

One central protagonist

My protagonist explores his role in an ever-changing pluralist world with different beliefs.

The story is a personal quest. However, I will also develop the larger history of the universe that brought this personal quest into fruition. I will also develop multiple characters with different stories.

**Theme**

How to live?

- Each major character in the story represents one worldview.
- The novel should answer the question through stories of each major character.

The relationship of the individual and his autonomy in a world filled with people of different beliefs with their own sense of autonomy.

**Narrator**

The story I will be building is pure fantasy. Though it was inspired by reality, it isn't a prisoner of facts.

I won't be using the first person narrator, to add more freedom. I will be narrating the story as third person.

What I could do is to give character to the narrator. The narrator could be a different person. But he or she has to be embedded in the world.

So there's a past world and a future world.

**Renaissance Project**

This project is a renaissance project because it is a hodge podge of everything I want to do, a mashup of my strengths. And it is rooted to my childhood.

Themes

- Metaphysics
- Epistemology
- Ethics
- Political Theory
- Aesthetics

In this project I will learn almost everything I am interested about and it will contribute into this big work of fiction.

**A Creative Expression and Exploration of My Personal Philosophy**

I can't succeed just by playing the philo game alone.

But I might have a better chance and enjoy it at the same time if I build a high fantasy world that would allow me to explore my philosophy and express it creatively.

**Some Scenes**

Pagdinig sa mga ibon sa loob ng bigasan/bakanteng templo. Bigasang nasisinagan ng araw.

- The child will in the future join the foreign invasion

**Act and Disasters**

- Ending:
