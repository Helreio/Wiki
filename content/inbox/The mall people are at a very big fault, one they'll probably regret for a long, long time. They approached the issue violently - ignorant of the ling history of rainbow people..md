# The mall people are at a very big fault, one they'll probably regret for a long, long time. They approached the issue violently - ignorant of the ling history of rainbow people.

However, to say that the trans - and the LGBTQ community at large really - has no fault, is far from true.

Thought experiment:

Let's say that I completely love transgender people, i dont scorn them, i dont hate them. Will that stop me from seeing a logical difference between a person who was born with a vagina and a person who got operated to have a vagina?

A: Person born with a vagina

B: Person got a vagina

A=B?

(nope. Logical contradiction)

Love will never keep me from being blind from the truth. There is an obvious difference between the two and when the LGBTQ and social justice warriors delude this truth by their rants, incidents like what happened at the mall, happen.

Without agreeing on definitions, we create confusion, and confusion creates misunderstandings, which creates unnecessary stress and violence.

If we sit down, put aside our political biases, and get clear with our definitions, and fix our policies to be true according to those, things will be a lot better, and people may be more able to treat those different from them more humanely.

P.S. please stop using the Bible to argue about these things, lest you'll just make a laughing stock out of yourself.
