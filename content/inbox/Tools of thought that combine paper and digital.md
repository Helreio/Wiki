# Tools of thought that combine paper and digital

Muse app

The digital tools that we currently have are still lacking a lot of the things we need to follow and extend brain processes. Imagine doing everything in analog-like tools and movements but information gets digitalized immediately.

There are just many things we can do in analog tat we cannot do in digitalâ€”subtle things that help us to think. For example, spreading out index cards on the floor and moving them around to freely make connections. The visual cue and the movement of our hands all have subtle effects on how we think. And these are lost in what a screen does to us. There are apps that mimic this (e.g., the corkboard in Scrivner). But the click and drag of a mouse are not the same as holding physical paper.

Nevertheless, there are so much limitation in analog systems: portability, monotonous tasks that take up time but could be done automatically, syncing different tools and workflows, securing data, and convenience issues. The cons of analog systems outweigh their pros.

The best tools for thought mimic analog materials but are fully integrated into digital environments where what we can do with them are extended in functionality. Before the perfect tools are created and get cheaper, we have to use a combination of digital and analog in our system.
