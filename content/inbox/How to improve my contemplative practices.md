# How to improve my contemplative practices

1. Avoid working in the weekends. Use the weekends to be out there with people and find opportunities to practice what you learn in your studies.
2. Deepen and lengthen your meditation practice.
3. Deepen and make your journaling practice worthwhile.
4. Read deeply and mindfully.
5. Treat your Talahardin session as a meditation session where you try to solve a single problem.
6. Establish a good sleeping habit.
7. Take longer walks.
