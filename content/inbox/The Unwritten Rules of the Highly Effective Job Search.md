# The Unwritten Rules of the Highly Effective Job Search

# 1 - Orville, Jessie, Ben, and the Pierson Method

You only need one good job offer to succeed in search.

The biggest obstacles in your job search are inside you: fear, feeling worthless, lack of confidence, etc.

- Don’t fight them back. Just keep your eye on them and proceed with courage.

Work on a well-planned job search and don’t quit.

# 2 - The Job Search Project

Skills and techniques are important, but they’re only one part of what you need for an effective job search.

Planning and organizing a systematic search is essential.

Pierson Method

- Measuring progress
- Managing the search project
- 12 steps in 3 phases

3 phases of the Pierson Method

1. Get Ready - plan and prepare
2. Get Moving - take a systematic approach
3. Manage Your Search - use progress measurements

Treat job search as a project. Plan and manage it.

**JOB SEARCH IS A WORK PROJECT**

**Project Planning and Preparation**

Project planning begins with knowing exactly what you want to get done, your goal.

**PLAN AND PREPARE**

Get Ready: Plan and Prepare

1. Read this book.
2. Create a Project Plan
3. Do a Reality Check.
4. Write your resume.

Create your Project Plan first before your resume.

- Your plan will provide focus on your resume.
- Your Professional Objective (your statement of what kind of work you want to do), could help you write a resume that talks about your ability to do a certain group of jobs.
- Knowing the Decision Makers in your Target Market could help you create a convincing resume

**Your Project Plan and Reality Check**

3 parts of an effective Project Plan

1. Professional Objective
2. Target Market (Target List)
3. Core Message

Professional Objective

- The more precisely you can define your Professional Objective, the more focused your search project becomes.

Target Market

- Employers who are hiring people like you.
- Employers you like
- It’s your personal job market and the focus of your search
- The Decision Makers in the right departments in the organizations on your Target List are the most important people you will talk to in your resume and in interviewing.

![Screen Shot 2019-10-27 at 2.14.58 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/83F1AD4B-50C8-448A-BDBE-586F76FE9733/AAC7847A-DC7B-4005-81E2-C7E96C6FC810_2/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-27%20at%202.14.58%20PM.png)

Core Message

- What you say in your resume and in your interview should be very similar.
- It should describe how well you can do the work defined by your Professional Objective.
- What you say about yourself and your Professional Objective to your Target Market.

Check your Project Plan to make sure it’s reasonable and workable.

**Prepare a Resume; Prepare for Interviewing**

Outline your Project Plan (and Core Message) before writing your resume

- Speaks to your chosen Target Market about you
- Builds a case for your candidacy
- Tells Decision Makers you can do the jobs defined by your Professional Objective

Prepare interviews the same way: convince your particular group of Decision Makers that you can do the jobs suggested by your Professional Objective.

**Prepare a Target List**

Use your Target List to focus on the best employers for you and systematically pursuing them.

Find a great new job by making yourself known to Decision Makers before they have an opening.

**TAKE A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH**

Get Moving

1. Gather information
2. Informally talk to people
3. Follow up with them, especially Decision Makers
4. Use some of the Seven Search Techniques

Gather information

- Research and talk to people who have information about the employers on your Target List.
- Use the information to decide which employers are the ones you want to concentrate on.
- Eliminate the ones you don’t like.
- Put more energy on those you like.

**Talk to People: Insiders and Decision Makers**

Insiders

- People at your own level
- Easy way to get in touch with the Decision Maker

Talk to the Decision Maker before they have an opening in order to get an inside track when the opening occurs.

- Not an interview
- Just an informal conversation on the phone or in person (few minutes)
- Systematically and intentionally put yourself in the radar of your potential employer so that you’ll be in his mind when there’s an opening.

**Follow Up With Decision Makers**

Let a number of Decision Makers know of your availability and qualifications.

Continue talking to as many of them as possible to make it more likely that someone will that you are contacted when there’s an opening.

Use one of the Seven Search Techniques appropriate to your situation.

![Screen Shot 2019-10-27 at 2.36.55 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/83F1AD4B-50C8-448A-BDBE-586F76FE9733/31B96AAA-D723-405E-90A0-CCA346F53307_2/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-27%20at%202.36.55%20PM.png)

**MANAGE YOUR SEARCH**

Manage Your Search: Use Progress Measurements

1. Track your progress
2. Recheck your project plan
3. Interview
4. Start your new job

Two most important things in job hunting

1. Pretty much everyone who really wants to work finds a job.
2. Progress measurements are essential to keeping a search moving and managing it effectively

Progress measurements prevent you from quitting.

- They let you know that even if you’re discouraged, you’re getting the job of job search done.

The average person talks to 25 different Decision Makers before getting hired by one of them.

To get in touch with one of these Decision Makers, the average person talks to about 15 other people (friends and acquaintances).

The process

1. Talk to friends and acquaintances.
2. Show them your Target List
3. Ask questions about the list (not for job openings, just information about those organizations and the chance to meet an insider, someone like you who works where you want to work.
4. Insiders introduces you to Decision Maker
5. Follow up on Decision Makers
6. Decision Maker invites you for a formal interview in an opening

You will find jobs by informally talking to other people.

Your Project Plan will get you organized about those informal contacts so you can get a job faster.

Progress measurements

- Numerical so objective
- Best way to get organized

![Screen Shot 2019-10-27 at 2.52.29 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/83F1AD4B-50C8-448A-BDBE-586F76FE9733/9B90488C-D413-48AB-A3FF-41FDC454628E_2/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-27%20at%202.52.29%20PM.png)

Refine your project plan based on information you get from talking to friends, acquaintances, insiders, and Decision Makers.

Final steps

- Interviewing
- Negotiating
- Starting a new job

**PROGRESS QUESTIONS**

- Before you have an offer or even an interview, how do you know if you are making progress in your search?
- How much progress did you make this week?

**PROGRESS MEASUREMENTS GUIDE THE PROJECT**

If your progress is below average, you should change your plan and techniques.

If your progress is above average, you should do more of whatever you have been doing.

**Conversations with 25 Decision Makers**

The key progress measurement is the number of conversations with the Decision Makers in the organizations on your Target List.

# 3 - Why You Need Progress Measurements

Progress measurements can help you keep your efforts at a reasonable level.

- You will know when you have put in a good week’s work, even in those weeks when there are no results yet.

When you are unemployed, finding a new job is very important, and you have nothing else to do.

**LOW PRODUCTIVITY SEARCH**

Two main reasons behind a low productivity search

- Discouragement
- Lack of knowledge on the right strategies and techniques

Consistently put time and effort into your search even when you are not getting immediate results or even if you feel discouraged.

The 5 Biggest Barriers to Productivity in Job Search

1. The rejection syndrome
2. Emotional stress
3. Working solo
4. Lowered self-esteem and confidence
5. No plan or the wrong plan

Your job in job search is to get out every day and get rejected.

Once you get enough rejections out of the way, you will find that one really good acceptance.

**OVERCOMING THE BARRIERS**

- Be aware of them.
- Create a Project Plan, check it and use it.
- Track your progress with numerical measures.
- Try a Job Search Work Team.

Address your barriers if they can be addressed.

With barriers that cannot be eliminated, you have to keep on track despite them.

Treat job search as a job and make a systematic effort every week until you succeed.

Create a Project Plan and prepare effectively.

Follow your plan and measure your progress toward a new job.

**Measuring Your Progress**

With a system for tracking progress, you can have a sense of accomplishment every day.

- Look at the progress you’ve made instead of the rejections.

If you get a one week worth of job search in four days, take three days off to reward yourself.

Teaming up with one or more other people while you are in search can be very useful.

# 4 - How Hiring Really Happens

Before starting a job search, consider the world of Decision Makers.

- How they think
- How they act
- What pressures push them to do things in certain ways
- How they handle hiring a new employee

Adjust your game plan based on how Decision Makers play the game.

**HUMAN RESOURCES AND THE DECISION MAKER**

The decision to hire you will be made by your next boss (the Decision Maker) - not the Human Resources department.

- DMs may add their own candidates at any stage in the process.

The DM is the key person in the hiring process.

**The Three Ways that Hiring Happens**

1. The Applicant Pool
2. The Created Position
3. Tapping a Known Candidate

Scenario #3 is the best and easiest way to go.

Scenario #1: The Applicant Pool

1. There is an open position.
2. A pool of candidates is collected and screened.
3. The DM interviews the top candidates.
4. The DM selects one of the candidates.

1/4 of hiring happens this way.

DMs use the Applicant Pool scenario because:

- They have to.
- It gives them a wider range of choices.
- The other two scenarios didn’t work.
- It’s the only way they know.

Jobs offered this way are usually leftovers, the less desirable jobs.

It’s the traditional way of hiring.

What the Applicant Pool scenario means for the candidate:

- Competition
- A formal process
- The resume is king

The Applicant Pool is best for:

- Candidates looking for the same kind of work
- Candidates who have strong credentials
- Those good at resume writing and formal interviewing

Scenario #2: The Created Position

1. You identify organizational needs (by talking to Insiders).
2. You discuss those needs with the DM.
3. You suggest meeting the needs by creating a new job.
4. The DM creates a new job and gives it to you.

No need for a job opening for hiring.

Not easy to do. Not common.

Only a small percentage of hiring happens in this way (less than 5%)

Hard but if you do it, it can be a great career move.

Don’t miss it.

Watch for this possibility in smaller and growing organizations.

Why DMs use the Created Position:

- It solves a problem.
- It can make their job easier.

What the Created Position scenario means for you:

- A really great job, tailor-made for you.
- You must take initiative.

Scenario #3: Tapping a Known Candidate

1. The DM knows of some qualified people.
2. A position opens up.
3. The DM hires one of the known candidates.

Skills are not the first consideration.

DMs prefer interested, enthusiastic people that they have some reason to like and trust.

Why DMS prefer Tapping a Known Candidate:

- It’s fast, easy, and inexpensive.
- They feel safer and more comfortable.
- It just seems to happen by itself.

What being a Known Candidate means for you:

- Limited competition, maybe none.
- It’s not difficult.
- Informal discussions can replace formal interviews.
- You talk to DMs before they have openings.

75% of hiring is happening this way.

Talking to people who are NOT hiring right now is usually the best way to look for a new job.

Talking to DMs before they have an opening is the best way to cover all three hiring scenarios.

**PURSUE THE DECISION MAKER, BEFORE THERE IS A JOB OPENING**

You want the right job, not simply the first one that comes up.

Pursue the right DMs at the right organizations. This increases your chances of getting a job you truly like.

**The Pierson Method Covers All Three Hiring Scenarios**

Key: Talking to DMs.

How to raise your odds of getting the job

- Talk to a DM is just before the opening occurs. That way, the DM will remember you when the opening happens.
- Get introduced by someone who knows the DM in any way.

You don’t know when the opening will happen.

What you should do is to systematically contact DMs.

The more you can contact, the more likely you’ll get an offer.

**Sooner or Later, Every Decision Maker Has an Opening**

When that moment comes, those who have already met the DM will have an advantage.

Core: Get your message to the right DMs, preferable before they have an opening.

**HOW HIRING USUALLY HAPPENS**

- The average job search includes conversations with 25 DMs.
- They have no opening when you first talk to them.
- Later, one of them has an opening and hires you.

The key to effective search is a Project Plan.

- It is as important as a resume.
- Make sure you are contacting the right DMs in the right way with the right message.

# 5 - Your Project Plan

The Project Plan identifies:

1. Your Professional Objective
2. Your Target Market
3. Your Core Message

Just start thinking about these three.

No need to have a complete Project Plan before you start your search.

Your plan will improve as you conduct your search.

**PROFESSIONAL OBJECTIVE**

Answers the question: What kind of work do you want to do?

State your profession or general field to tell employers what you have to offer them.

Two kinds of PO:

1. Jobe title
2. Cluster of possible job titles

**WHAT YOUR PROFESSIONAL OBJECTIVE DOES FOR YOU**

- Focuses your search.
- Makes you a stronger candidate.
- Helps you find a job where you will do well and be happy.
- Gives you a better resume.

PO describes what you are looking for, so it makes your search easier.

If you can describe what you want, people can help you find it.

Limit your options to a cluster of jobs you like and can convince people you can do.

**A CLEAR MESSAGE FOR DECISION MAKERS AND OTHERS**

A PO tells DMs how you can help them.

A PO makes you a more attractive. candidate (you know what you want and are interested in).

You must be able to describe your PO in one sentence or less.

**Focus on the Best Jobs for You**

Better chance of finding a work you like quickly.

**A Better Resume**

Everything in your resume needs to support your PO.

Ask: “Would this help convince the DM that I can do that particular kind of work well?”

- Yes. Include.
- No. Remove or downplay.

**TARGET MARKET**

PO helps you think about your Target Market.

The more you think about the two together, the more they get clearer.

When you talk to people about them, they’ll even be clearer.

**YOUR TARGET MARKET**

Answers:

- Which organizations do you most want to work for?
- Who hires people to do the kind of work you want to do?

TM becomes a Target List of actual employers.

Other questions

- Where do you want to work?
- Business? Government? Not-for-profit?
- Large? Small?

Your TM must be defined partly by where the work is and partly by what you want.

But what you want is more important.

**HOW TO DEFINE YOUR TARGET MARKET**

Define:

- The geographic location of your targets.
- The industry or type of organization you want to join.
- The size of the organization you want to join.

**Geographic Location**

Location is determined by:

- personal preference and
- market demand

Draw your preferences on a map.

- Country
- State
- Province
- County
- City
- Postal Codes

Make this precisely defined.

**Industry or Type of Organization**

Determined by:

- personal preference and
- personal objective

You will be seen as a stronger candidate in certain industries because of your past experience.

**Size of Organization**

Defined by:

- Annual revenue (or budget)
- Number of employees

Use a numerical measure when talking to people.

Size could determine:

- the available departments in the company
- the amount of your salary
- the number of your coworkers

**A Target List of Potential Employers**

Enter geographic location, industry, and size to a database or use it in directories.

**WHAT YOUR TARGET MARKET DOES FOR YOU**

- Makes sure your search includes all worthwhile employers.
- Gives you a tool to organize your efforts.
- Makes sure that your personal job market is big enough.
- Prepares you for proactive search, covering all three hiring scenarios.

TL helps you prioritize your efforts in the search.

- Throw out or include employers

TM makes your PP more realistic.

- Assures that you are pursuing a market with plenty of potential jobs in it.
- Covers all three scenarios (KC, CP, and AP)

**WHAT YOUR TARGET LIST DOES FOR YOU**

- Opens the door to the KC and CP scenarios.
- Helps you focus your efforts.
- Increases your chances of finding a great employer.

Decide which organizations you want to proactively pursue.

Collect information you need to prioritize the organizations you have listed.

Pursue the top organizations in your TL every week.

Collect more information on targets so you can continue to refine and better prioritize the list.

Use your TL when talking to friends and acquaintances in job search.

**The Target List is Essential**

TL makes your search focused and organized.

**YOUR CORE MESSAGE**

Answers:

- What will you say about yourself to DMs in your TM?
- How will you describe yourself in one minute?

CM provides evidence that you can do the work defined by your PO.

“What can you honestly say about yourself that will convince DMs in your TM that you are a good candidate for the objective you are pursuing?"

Helps you describe yourself better.

You know what to emphasize and what to leave out.

**Your Qualifications and How You Talk About Them**

You don’t have to have all of the expected qualifications.

You need to know how to talk about your qualifications.

1. Name your qualifications
2. Organize them into a brief presentation designed to convince the particular group of DMs you have targeted.

It’s so important to know who your DMs are.

Get clear on your PO and TM first. This will make the CM clearer.

**WHAT YOUR CORE MESSAGE DOES FOR YOU**

- Tells you what to include in your resume.
- Lays the foundation for interview success.
- Creates powerful consistent communication.

You are often the number one source of a potential employer’s information about you.

You have a lot of qualifications and experiences but your CM requires you to focus on those relevant to your desired job.

**A Consistent Powerful Message**

CM makes sure that you are repeating the best possible message about how good you are at doing the work in your PO to people you meet.

Constantly maintain a positive focus on your main selling points.

**USING YOUR PROJECT PLAN**

PP generates focused effective activities.

Your PO, TM, and CM should all fit together.

PP is a way to clearly define what success looks like in your search.

PP creates a road map to get there.

# 6 - Choosing Your Next Job

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.057030,120.453816)

The subjective_personal and objective_practical come together in a job search.

- You need work that fits who you are as a person.
- You need to earn enough money doing it.

Get advice but make the final decision.

Think some more.

Then ask the logical questions to narrow them down.

Discuss your thinking on career decisions with other people.

Look for a similar job as your most recent one if:

- You have experience.
- You enjoyed it.
- There are no major obstacles to continuing in the field.

Look for a different kind of work if you’re no longer satisfied with the previous one.

You could also make just minor changes in your professional objective or target market.

Professional Objective

- A very brief statement of the kind of work you’re looking for right now.
- To write it: (1) think about what you do not want and (2) think about what you do want.

Three key areas in creating your professional objective

1. Interests - what you like to do
2. Skills - what you are good at doing
3. Values - what’s important to you in life

**Interests**

- It’s okay to have your greatest passion outside work.
- Look for work in between interest and passion.
- Good starting point for developing your Professional Objective because you are likely to do better at work that interests you.

A job search is an opportunity to align your work with who you are as a person.

What you are NOT interested in is just as important as what you are interested in.

- Use this to narrow down.

Your interests have an effect on your choice of Target Market (where you will work).

**Skills**

- Things you have practiced and can now do well.
- Products of experience

You don’t need to have all of the expected skills to get a job. But it helps if you have some of them.

If you picked the right skills at the wrong job title, you need to work harder to show the employer that you have them.

Sources of skills

- Work
- Educational projects
- Life experiences

Areas of specialized knowledge are part of your skill package.

You learn more skills in your jobs but you don’t have certificates for them so you may not notice how much you learned.

Create an inventory of your skills.

- It will help you write a better resume.
- It will help you interview more effectively because it will remind you to talk about all of your relevant skills.

Practice talking about your skills.

Formulate a Professional Objective that fits your skills.

Adjust how you cluster, label, and discuss your skills to fit your Professional Objective.

**Values**

- Your beliefs about what is most and least important in life.
- You make decisions based on them.
- You feel uncomfortable when they are compromised.
- You feel satisfied when they are fulfilled.
- Values evolve, so see if yours have shifted.

Your work should be consistent with your values.

Which three to four areas are most important to you?

- There is some overlap between values and interests.

Three other factors

- Personality
- Long-term career goals and life plan
- Your mission, purpose, or vision

**Personality**

It’s important for you to be able to be yourself while in your job.

Introverted

- Work alone
- Work in a small group
- Work for long periods
- Concentrate on a single activity

Use psychological instruments to understand your personality trait.

Ask yourself (and your friends) some questions.

**Long-term Goals**

Consider what you want from your work and career in the long term.

Make sure that your next job is a step in that direction.

Considering your long-term life plan might produce clues for what kind of work you want now.

**Mission, Purpose, or Vision**

Start with an aerial view from 30,000 feet of how you want your life and work to look.

Translate that picture into specifics in all areas of life, including work.

**Create a Professional Objective**

Step one: Choose a Professional Objective based on Your Interests

- Let your interests lead the way in making career choices.
- If you had the right education and experience, what jobs would you be enthusiastic about?
- What jobs would you do that you would never watch the clock?

Step Two: Refine your ideal job.

- Ask, "Do you want it?"
- Check your values, personality, mission, and long-term plans.

Step Three: Check to see if it’s practical.

- Ask, "Can you get it?"
- Check your skills, knowledge, and experience.
- Are your skills and experience sufficient to qualify you for jobs you’re interested in?
- If none of your ideal jobs are practical right now, what practical options are similar? What real jobs would be stepping-stones toward the ideal jobs? How close can you get to the ideal? What elements of the ideal can be found in other jobs?

Do a career exploration if you have limited work experience or you’re considering large changes.

- Read about possible jobs.
- Talk to people who actually do them.
- Visit people in your new field in their workplace.

Talking to others is an important part of settling on the right Professional Objective.

See that you have many choices.

Then narrow them down to a workable, practical Professional Objective.

Use the Either/Or list on p. 109 to narrow down.

- Some choices include neither choice.
- Some could include a both choice.

**Your Professional Objective**

- One sentence or less
- Not too broad nor too narrow

How to use your Professional Objective

- Use it as a headline to your resume that immediately tells readers what category of potential employee you are.
- Use it to guide how you write your resume.
- Use it as a starting point for your Project Plan.

Your Professional Objective must be defined in less than 30 seconds.

Your Professional Objective should always name your profession.

- You could use a job title if it’s well-known.
- If it’s not a single job, your PO should describe a cluster of related job titles or a broad generic term applicable to many jobs, organizations, and industries.

Your Professional Objective may also include an indication of how advanced you are in the profession.

**Building a Case for Your Professional Objective**

- Experience - direct or transferable
- Evidence of relevant skills or knowledge: How much? How strong?
- Education and credentials

The easiest way to build a case for your PO is to show that you have already done that same kind of work.

Experience

- Direct experience should backed up by information
- If you don’t have direct experience, use related experience to show that you have the ability
- Transferable experience - past work using similar skills

Transferable Skills

- Require some explanation or translation
- Use those from life experiences
- Knowledge can also be transferable
- Understand the new field well enough to explain how your knowledge and skills apply to that field.

Educations and Credentials

- Use these if you don’t have a lot fo direct experience.
- Get additional education or credentials to strengthen your case.

Define a PO consistent with who you are.

Establish evidence that you would be good at that kind of work.

Don’t give up quickly if it’s impractical.

Talk to people and pursue it to see if you can shape it into something workable.

Additional career research

- Read a career development book.
- Talk to people who actually do the kind of work you are considering.
- Check out career-related psychological instruments, inventories, and informal questionnaires.
- Consider career counseling

---

**NEXT ACTIONS**

Discuss your thinking on career decisions with other people.

Reflect on the following questions:

- What kind of work engages me?
- What kind of work are my heart and mind both attracted to?

Interests Inventory

Review ALL your past work experiences.

- What did I really enjoy doing?
- What did I dislike? (Avoid these in your next work.)

Combine the two lists into a master list.

Skills Inventory

1. List out all the accomplishments and contributions, large and small, that you enjoyed doing in paid and unpaid jobs in the past.
2. Analyze each to see what skills they required.
3. Identify which skills come up the most often.
4. Organize the most frequently used skills into 3-6 logical clusters and give each a name reflecting the entire skill category.
5. Ask: Do these categories tie in to jobs you are interested in? Do the skill clusters suggest any other jobs you might be interested in?

Practice talking about your skills.

1. Find someone.
2. Talk about each job you ever had.
3. Tell exactly what you did.
4. List the skills it took to do those things.
5. Cover the routine you did.
6. Cover those times when you went beyond the job description.

Personality

Use your understanding of your personality to pinpoint your next job.

Long-term Goals

Ask yourself:

1. What kind of work would you most likely be doing in five or 10 years?
2. What kind of work or organization right now would be a step in that direction?

Think more broadly.

- What do you want your life to look like?
- Work sets up a particular lifestyle.

Mission, Vision, and Purpose

Make your mission, vision, and purpose part of determining your Professional Objective.

Either/Or

Use the Either/Or list on p. 109 to narrow down on your Professional Objective.

# 7 - Your Target List

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.057030,120.453816)

Resume is a central tool in job search.

Your resume has to be the right tool for the job.

Everything on your resume should convince people that you can do the kind of work in your PO.

Your resume should talk about one profession or one general kind of work.

Your resume should speak to one particular audience.

Writing a good resume + conducting a good job search

1. Define your PO so you know what to talk about.
2. Define your TM so you know who you’re talking to and where to find them.

TM

- Group of organizations you want to work for
- Organizations that hire people who do the kind of work you want to do
- Defined by geographic location, industry, and size.
- Use TM to create a TL.

TM + TL = clear picture of your target audience

TL is as important as your resume.

- Helps you see who your resume is designed for.

Write a resume as a communication to DMs in your TM.

TL

- Not a list of employers with job openings
- List of organizations that have people doing the kind of work you want

**CREATING YOUR TARGET LIST**

- Use databases, if possible.
- Use directories in print.
- Gather information from talking to others.

**Databases**

Find the right database on the Internet.

Type your criteria:

- Geography
- Industry
- Size

Look for databases at public libraries in cities or at college and university libraries.

**Directories in Print**

Slower than databases

But you could learn a lot about your TM while browsing them

Use both databases and directories to get more accurate information.

Talk to people to update incorrect information.

**Making a Target List by Asking Around**

Ask around.

1. Define your geographic area, industry, and size.
2. List out all the examples you can think of.
3. Show your list to a friend and ask them if they can think of others.
4. Ask them if they know of directories, Internet resources, or other people who might have additional information.

How to come up with your list

1. Start with directories and databases.
2. Refine your list by talking to people.
3. Create a TL of about 40.
4. Start getting acquainted with the organizations.

**HOW TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR TARGETS**

- Check their Web sites.
- Read their publications.
- Read articles about them.
- Ask around.
- Talk to an insider.

While building your TL, you can start getting acquainted with individual target organizations.

Check printed materials (brochures, sales materials, etc.)

Check out what other, more objective people say about your targets.

- Newspaper or journal articles
- Internet

Ask around.

Most useful info

- What they’re doing
- What it’s like to work there
- Who works there
- Who is in charge of what

The best way of getting information about a target organization is to talk to someone who works there.

Questions to ask

- What do they do?
- How do they do it?
- How well are they doing?
- What is it like to work there?
- What do they expect from employees?
- How do they treat employees?
- What do they pay for the kind of work you want?
- How can you help them?

Whenever you can, ask for:

- An introduction to an insider, someone who works there.
- Your Decision Maker’s name, and an introduction to them.

2 information you need

1. Info to help you decide if you want to work there
2. Info to help you get a job there.

The better you understand them, what they do and how they do it, the better you’ll do in an interview.

As you understand the differences between you target organizations, you can better decide which of them you prefer.

If you know how much someone in your target organization earns, you’ll be able to know if your first offer is a good one or a weak one. This puts you in a much better position to negotiate salary.

**PRIORITIZING YOUR TARGET LIST**

Choose your top targets because:

- You like them.
- They have more people employed in the job titles you want.
- They are well run and successful.

Use the information you gather in prioritizing your TL.

Stay away from the question of who has openings and who is not hiring.

**Your Target List: The Rolling 40**

Your entire search is about prioritizing and reprioritizing your TL.

An organization is at the top of your list if:

1. You like it.
2. You know enough to know that you want to work there.
3. You know that they do indeed hire people with your skills.
4. You know that they’re a reasonably well-run organization.

**USE YOUR TARGET LIST TO FIND A JOB FASTER**

Create a TL + talk to people

Meet DMs and insiders before there is an opening.

The more you know about your top targets, the better you can tailor your communication message to them.
