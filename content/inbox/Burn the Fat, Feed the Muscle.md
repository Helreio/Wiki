# Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle

# Chapter 14 - Burn The Fat, Feed The Muscle Meal Planning System

Always start the day with a meal plan.

Planning is the simple cure that solves every diet problem.

A meal plan is your eating goal for the day.

# Chapter 7 - Understanding Calories

Even when you’re training hard, if the calorie surplus is too large, the excess beyond what’s needed for muscle development is deposited into fat storage.

**THE LAW OF ENERGY BALANCE**

To lose weight, you must burn more calories than you consume each day.

To gain weight, you must consume more calories than you burn each day.

**COROLLARIES**

**1. Too much of anything—even healthy foods—will get stored as body fat.**

Regardless of how healthy the foods are, if you eat more calories than you burn, you’ll still gain weight, usually in the form of fat.

Low-carb, high-protein diets reduce hunger and make it harder to overeat. The end result is that most people automatically eat fewer calories.

There’s no such thing as a diet where you can eat all you want and lose weight simply by eating (or avoiding) one particular food or food group.

**2. If you eat fewer calories than you burn each day (i.e., you’re in a calorie deficit), even if you eat unhealthy (“junk”) food, you won’t store it as body fat.**

If you want to stay healthy, calorie quality is important.

It lets you relax and enjoy your favorite indulgences from time to time without feeling guilty, as long as you maintain your calorie deficit.

**THE IMPORTANCE OF PORTION CONTROL**

Getting leaner requires the discipline and willpower to control your calories at all times, even when you eat your occasional cheat meals. Always pay attention to portion sizes. Notice how full your stomach feels and never stuff yourself. Lose the idea that you must clear your plate, especially at restaurants or when you’re served by others. In“stead, stop eating when you’re only 80 percent full. Even better, know your exact calorie needs and stop when you’ve reached your predetermined limit for each meal.

**HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR TOTAL DAILY ENERGY EXPENDITURE (TDEE)**

The first step in designing your personal fat-burning plan is to calculate how many calories you need every day. This number is called your total daily energy expenditure, or TDEE. It’s also known as your maintenance level, because this is the point where your calorie deposits are equal to your calorie withdrawals. TDEE is the total number of calories your body burns in 24 hours, including basal metabolic rate and all activities.

**Six Factors That Influence Your Daily Calorie Needs**

1. BASAL METABOLIC RATE (BMR)

BMR usually accounts for the largest part of your total daily calorie expenditure—about two-thirds.

2. ACTIVITY LEVEL

The more active you are the more calories you burn.

3. WEIGHT

The bigger you are, the more calories you require to sustain and move your body.

4. LEAN BODY MASS

The higher your LBM, the higher your BMR.

This means that the more muscle you have, the more calories you’ll burn at rest.

5. AGE

Metabolic rate tends to slow with age. Therefore, the number of calories the average person requires also decreases with age.

6. GENDER

Men usually require more calories than women. The difference is not entirely due to gender but to body size.

**ESTIMATE CALORIE REQUIREMENTS**

QUICK START

FOR MAINTAINING WEIGHT (TDEE):

Men (average): 2,700–2,900 calories

Women (average): 2,000–2,200 calories

FOR LOSING WEIGHT (DEFICIT):

Men (average): 2,100–2,500 calories

Women (average): 1,400–1,800 calories

**THREE FORMULAS TO CALCULATE CUSTOMIZED CALORIE NEEDS**

• the quick method (use this one for a quick estimate with the least number crunching)

• the Harris-Benedict equation (use this one if you don’t know your lean body mass)

• the Katch-McArdle equation (use this one if you know your lean body mass)

# Chapter 6 - Setting Your Goals And Training Your Mind

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=14.674786,121.054976)

The crucial first step is setting a goal.

There’s a big difference between knowing what to do and doing what you know. A goal is the bridge that spans this gap.

The secret to staying motivated all the time is to set emotionally charged goals, commit them to writing, and stay focused on those goals day and night.

I’m convinced that the most important part of getting in great shape is simply making up your mind to do it. You get in shape by setting goals and thinking about them all day long.

Goals work because they harness and direct the awesome power of your subconscious mind, which guides your behavior on autopilot.

**HOW YOUR “MENTAL COMPUTER” IS PROGRAMMED FOR SUCCESS OR FAILURE**

Everything you hear, see, say, read, or think repeatedly eventually filters into your subconscious mind, especially if it’s repeated with emotion. In other words, you are constantly programming your brain through conscious self-suggestion—or you are allowing your brain to be programmed through unconscious external suggestion. That’s why you must take conscious control over programming your own brain.

**THE POWER OF FOCUS**

It’s crucial to focus on what you want to achieve, not on what you want to avoid.

It’s so important to take conscious control over your speech and mental dialogue and program your brain with positive instructions.

**THE MOST POWERFUL GOAL-ACHIEVING FORMULA IN THE WORLD**

**1. Set specific goals.**

**2. Set measurable goals.**

**3. Set big goals.**

- [ ] Decide what you would like to look like if you could have any body you wanted. See the picture in your mind. Make it clear, vivid, and dynamic. Dream. Fantasize. You’ve been endowed with an amazing creative faculty called imagination. Use it. It’s the starting point of a new self-image and all lasting changes.
- [ ] Don’t ask yourself, “Is it possible to reach this goal?” Instead ask, “How can I achieve this goal?” and “Am I willing to pay the price necessary to achieve this goal?” You can always find a way if you keep asking how and you can accomplish virtually anything if you’re willing to pay the price.

**4. Set realistic deadlines.**

- [ ] 1-2 pounds to loss per week is ideal.

**5. Set long-term and short-term goals.**

1. Long-term goals and your ultimate “ideal body”
2. One-year goals - shed 100 lbs.
3. Three-month goals - loose 6% body fat and 18-24 lbs. (Most important goal. Write it down and visualise it.)
4. Weekly goals (weekly body composition tests and weigh-ins) - feedback
5. Daily goals (habits to develop, behaviors to do every day) -
6. The goal of continually beating your personal best (personal records or “PRs”)

The goal card is the high-achiever’s secret weapon. Choose your most important, highest-priority “goal for the next three months. Write it down as an affirmation on a pocket-sized card and carry it with you everywhere you go. Feel naked without it. Read it as many times a day as possible–while you eat breakfast, wait in lines, sit at stoplights, and when you’re on the treadmill. It’s the simplest, easiest, yet most powerful tool you can start using today to stay focused and train your mind for success.

**6. Make sure your goals don’t conflict; prioritize and focus on your one most important goal.**

If your body fat is above average, then your number one goal should be shedding fat first, because high body fat is a health risk and it’s easier to build muscle on a leaner body. Once the fat is off, you can rewrite your goals and go into maintenance mode or work on gaining lean mass.

**7. Establish the emotional reasons why you want to achieve your goals.**

1. What’s important to you about reaching your goal?
2. Why is that important to you?
3. What impact, specifically, will achieving this goal have on your life? (How will your life be different and better after you’ve achieved it?)
- Who is your fitness role model?
- What do you want to look like?
- Do you want to look like a bodybuilder, an athlete, or a model?
- Do you want to impress anyone?
- Do you want to prove something?
- Do you want to be a role model or set an example?
- Do you want more energy?
- Do you want more mobility so you can enjoy certain sports and activities more?
- Do you want to win a contest or award?
- Do you want more self-confidence?
- Do you want to look great in certain types of clothes?
- Do you want to look good for a certain event (for example, a vacation, a wedding, a reunion, or a birthday)?
- Do you want to look great on the beach?
- Do you want to attract someone special into your life?

**8. Write out a goal list in the form of affirmations.**

a) Make your affirmations personal: Use the word “I” with a verb after it.

- [ ] “I am so happy and thankful now that I am ________________” (fill in your goal)."

b) Write your affirmations in the present tense.

- [ ] Write, think, and visualize your goal as if you’ve already achieved it.

c) State your goal in positive terms

**9. Read your affirmations (your goal list) at least twice a day and always keep your goals in front of you and on your mind.**

Read your list at least twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. Read them more often if you can. If you want to amplify the effect of the affirmation technique, don’t just read your affirmations; write them out by hand every single day or record them in your own voice and listen to them regularly.

After you’ve set all your goals and written your affirmations, use the power of repetition even more by keeping your goals in front of you all day long. Post your goal statements in a conspicuous place, such as on your refrigerator, on your bathroom mirror, or in your daily appointment book. Keep a goal card of your three-month goals in your pocket. Paste them onto the dashboard of your car. Set them as your mobile phone wallpaper. Stick them on top of your computer monitor or make them your desktop background and screen saver so you look at them all day long.

They work when you continue to repeat them with faith, emotion, and belief over and over again so many times that they replace your old, negative, internal dialogue.

**10. Read your goals with faith.**

Act as if. Read affirmation statements written in the present tense as if they were already achieved. See mental pictures of yourself as if you have already achieved your goal. When you look in the mirror every day, see what you want to become, not what is presently there. Behave as if you were already there. Speak as if you’ve already arrived.

**11. As you read your affirmations, mentally visualize them as already achieved.**

**WHAT YOU SHOULD DO EVERY TIME YOU REACH A GOAL**

Celebrate and reward yourself.

Keep a list of your achieved goals.

Set new goals continually.

# Chapter 5 - Tracking Progress: The Feedback Loop System That Won’t Let You Fail

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=14.674786,121.054974)

“There is no such thing as failure—only feedback, only results."

**THE FAT-LOSS SUCCESS SYSTEM THAT NEVER FAILS**

1. Know your outcome. Decide exactly where you want to go.
2. Establish your starting point.
3. Formulate a plan of action.
4. Act on your plan consistently.
5. Develop the sensory acuity to know if what you are doing is working or not. If it’s working, keep doing it.
6. If it’s not working, do something else.
7. Be flexible in your approach and be persistent.

**TEN FEEDBACK TOOLS TO MEASURE YOUR PROGRESS**

1. Body fat percentage
2. Skinfold thickness
3. Total body weight
4. Lean body mass (LBM)
5. Fat weight
6. How you look in the mirror
7. Before and after photographs
8. Measurements (tape measure)
9. Clothing sizes and how clothes fit
10. Other people’s opinions

**HOW TO USE A WEEKLY PROGRESS CHART**

Date, body fat percentage, total weight, lean body mass, fat weight, and weekly change in each

Skinfold measurements (in millimeters)

When you start the program, weigh yourself and have your body fat measured. Then fill in the first row on your chart, including the date, your starting body weight, your body fat percentage, and your lean body mass. You can also take circumference measurements if you choose. Every week, recheck your progress and update your chart, including the change from last week.

**HOW TO WEIGH YOURSELF THE RIGHT WAY**

To get the most consistent weigh-in, always weigh yourself under the same conditions. Measure yourself on the same scale on the same day of the week at the same time of day, wearing the same amount of clothes.

**THE ESSENCE OF THE FEEDBACK SYSTEM: LET YOUR RESULTS DICTATE YOUR APPROACH**

The fact is the results you produce each week are the only true measure of whether you’ve made the right choices. Results are what count.

When you discover an approach that works for you, develop immunity from criticism, disregard unhelpful comments from those who disagree with your approach, and judge your success only by your weekly progress.

By following this system, using body composition measurement, performance feedback, and progress charting, you will, through an evolutionary learning process, figure out your body type and develop your own personal formula quickly. Once you’ve discovered your personal formula, it will always be there for you for the rest of your life, whenever you want to go back to it.

“Measure everything you want to improve.”

# Chapter 4 - Measuring Body Composition

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=14.674786,121.054974)

Forget about weight. Concentrate on muscle.

Weight loss and fat loss are not the same.

Forget about BMI and height-weight charts; the ideal way to rate your weight, check your health, and track your progress is body fat testing.

**BODY FAT TESTING**

1. How much of your weight is body fat?
2. How much of your weight is lean body mass?

Measure your body fat every week to get continual feedback about the effect of your nutrition and training to your body.

Keep track of fat burned and muscle gained.

**AVERAGE BODY FAT LEVEL**

Women - 23% (female hormones and child-bearing genetics)

Men - 17%

The average person loses 6.6 pounds of lean body mass every decade after age 20.

The rate of lean tissue loss increases after age 45.

Average male college student (20 y/o) - 15%

Average sedentary middle-aged male - 25% or more

**IDEAL BODY FAT LEVEL**

An optimal body fat percentage is around 16 percent to 20 percent for women and 10 percent to 14 percent for men. These ideal body fat goals will take work, but they are achievable and maintainable by almost anyone. Ideal body fat for athletes may be even lower, depending on the sport.

BODY FAT RATING SCALE

MALE

Competition Shape (Ripped)

3%-6%

Very Lean (Excellent)

<10%

Lean (Good)

10%-14%

Satisfactory (Fair)

15%-19%

Improvement Needed (Poor)

20%-25%

Major Improvement Needed (Very Poor)

26%-30%

Focus on improving yourself not on chasing a number.

What counts is whether you’re healthy and happy with how you look.

**MAINTAINING LOW BODY FAT LEVELS**

Trying to maintain extremely low body fat levels for too long might not be healthy or realistic.

Men may drop as low as 3 percent to 5 percent for competitions, and then maintain their body fat levels at 8 percent to 10 percent in the off-season.

**HOW TO MEASURE BODY COMPOSITION**

Skinfold Testing is the easiest and most practical

Skinfold caliper

The results are very accurate for people in the range of 15 percent to 35 percent body fat. For individuals with over 35 percent body fat, the accuracy of the pinch test does go down somewhat.

The important thing is to have the same person measure you with the same caliper and the same formula every time. Even with the most skilled tester, skinfolds are only accurate within 3 to 4 percent.

The accuracy is not as important as the consistency of repeated measurements so that you can chart your progress effectively from one measurement to the next.

Alternatives

1. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)
2. BIA Body Fat Scales and Hand Grip Tests
3. Underwater Weighing (Hydrostatic Testing)
4. The Bod Pod (Air Displacement)
5. Circumference Testing - If your waist measurement is going down, your body fat percentage is almost always going down as well. Your waist measurement is also an important health marker. Fat stored in the abdominal area is unhealthier than fat stored in the extremities. A large waist measurement is a symptom of metabolic syndrome, a precursor to diabetes, and it correlates to increased risk of heart disease and stroke. You’re at risk if you’re male and your waist measurement is over 40 inches or if you’re female and your waist measurement is over 35 inches.
6. DEXA and other body fat testing methods

**HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR FAT, WEIGHT AND LEAN BODY MASS**

1. Measure your body fat percentage.
2. Calculate how much of your weight is fat (Fat Weight).
3. Calculate how much of your weight is muscle (Lean Body Mass or LBM).

To calculate your LBM in pounds, you need to know two things: your body weight and your body fat percentage. First, determine how many pounds of fat you’re carrying by multiplying your body fat percentage by your weight. You can then calculate your lean mass by subtracting the pounds of fat from your total body weight.

It’s still wise to have a weight goal in pounds as well as a body fat percentage goal. To calculate your ideal body weight, you need to know your current weight, your body fat percentage, your lean mass, and your target (desired) body fat percentage.

- The ideal weight formula is: lean body mass (LBM) ÷ (1 − target body fat %).
- TBF is expressed as a decimal (15% body fat = 0.15).
- You can subtract up to 2%–3% more off the estimated ideal formula weight if you want to account for potential water-weight losses.

**TRACK YOUR PROGRESS**

You’ll learn more about your body by measuring and tracking your body weight, body fat, and lean body mass for just a few weeks than you will by reading about it for years.

Recording your results, getting into a performance feedback loop, and charting your progress are steps that guarantee you’ll never fail.

# Chapter 3 - Understanding Your Body Type And Customising Your Plan

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=14.674786,121.054974)

One of the greatest secrets of body transformation is to “know thyself” and customize your training, nutrition, and lifestyle to suit your body type instead of blindly following someone else. Understanding the uniqueness of your body also helps you set expectations as well as keeps you motivated when the going gets tough.

However, everyone can improve their fitness and physique above and beyond where it is today. Your goal should be to achieve your personal best while avoiding comparisons to others who have different genetics than you.

**THE TEN MAJOR GENETIC VARIABLES THAT AFFECT FAT LOSS, MUSCLE GROWTH, STRENGTH, AND ATHLETIC ABILITY**

**1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**

- Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy you burn at rest every day just to maintain normal body functions such as breathing, circulation, digestion, and so on.
- The average male has a BMR of about 1,900 calories and the average female 1,400 calories.
- Naturally, BMR can vary a lot based on body size and lean mass. But BMR can also vary between people who weigh the same because of differences in thyroid, organ mass, and other genetic factors.

**2. Number of fat cells**

- Some people are born with more fat cells than others, and women have more fat cells than men.
- Obviously, the person with more sites for fat storage has a disadvantage.
- Fat cells can increase in both size and number. They can multiply during rapid weight gain, which is another reason to keep your calories in check and your weight under control.
- The good news is, with the right nutrition and training, even someone with a large number of fat cells can shrink them all and get dramatically leaner.

**3. Number of muscle fibers**

- Like fat cells, you were born with a predetermined number of muscle fibers.
- Muscle fibers can get larger, in a process called hypertrophy, or they can get smaller, or atrophy.
- Unlike fat cells, muscle cells can’t multiply in number.
- If you were born with a large number of muscle fibers, you have a greater potential to grow muscle than someone with fewer fibers.

**4. Muscle fiber type**

- Some are suited to endurance work (slow-twitch fibers) while others are suited for strength, power, and explosive work (fast-twitch fibers).

**5. Muscle insertions**

**6. Limb Length**

**7. Joint size**

**8. Digestive differences**

**9. Food allergies and insensitivities**

**10. Carbohydrate tolerance**

The great news is that fat loss and fitness are not determined by genetics alone. The way your body looks today is the result of genetics, behavior, and environment all put together. The truth is the factors you can’t control are small potatoes compared to the ones you can.

Dedication, discipline, and hard work can take you so far, it can appear as if you’ve shattered your genetic “limits."

Accept the challenge of lifelong personal improvement. Regardless of your genetics, you can transform yourself as long as you follow the right plan and customize it for your body type.

**METABOLIC TYPE**

Are you carb tolerant or carb intolerant? And if you’re carb intolerant, to what degree?

Modern body-typing science is based on a phenotypic system, which assumes that the way your body looks is a result of behavior and environment, not just genetics.

Your body changes on its own with growing and aging, and you change your body purposely with nutrition, training, and lifestyle choices.

Body type doesn’t dictate what your destiny is, but it does tell you what your tendency is and understanding your tendencies is valuable. We all have a natural body type we’re born with. If we don’t make a conscious effort to change the factors we control—behavior and environment—we’ll always drift back to our inherent body types.

Customization can be the difference between great results and no results.

The primary cause of excess body fat is your own attitude, behavior, and lifestyle. Science confirms that overweight people are more likely to be made than born and that following a healthy lifestyle can counteract gene-related risks.

Most of the factors affecting body composition are entirely under your control. No matter what your body type or genetic potential, you can always improve by consistently taking action in all these areas.

**THE FACTORS YOU CONTROL**

- How much you eat
- What you eat
- When you eat
- What type of exercise you do
- How frequently you exercise
- How long you exercise
- How hard you exercise
- Your overall lifestyle
- Who you socialize with and allow to influence you
- Your mental attitude

If you want to burn fat and transform your body for good, the first step is to accept 100 percent responsibility for where you are now.

If you don’t believe you’re in control and responsible for your life, for better or worse, how do you expect to change it?

You are responsible for who you are, where you are, and what you have—and that includes the way your body looks.

Be realistic about your body type and accept the role it plays in changing your body.

You can overcome nearly any obstacle if you’re willing to work hard enough.

# Chapter 2 - Why Diets Fail And Why This Plan Won't

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=14.674786,121.054974)

**SIX STRATEGIES TO BURN THE FAT FOREVER, WITHOUT DIETING OR DEPRIVING YOURSELF**

**1. Think “habit” not “diet."**

- You achieve permanent results by adopting new habits that you can maintain for the rest of your life. These habits must include the way you eat, the way you think, and the way you move.
- The roots of nutrition and exercise habits can be formed in less than 28 days. That’s why it’s so important to give 100 percent effort and commitment in the beginning while you build up momentum.

**2. Maintain your muscle.**

- A simple strategy for permanent fat loss is never lose muscle.
- Weight training is a huge factor when it comes to keeping your muscle while you’re shedding the fat, so when you get to the chapter on training, read it carefully and take it seriously.
- On the nutrition side, the biggest keys to maintaining muscle include getting enough protein and being conservative with calorie cuts.

**3. Cut calories conservatively.**

- You must have a calorie deficit to burn body fat but don’t do it too fast.
- The smartest, safest, and healthiest approach for permanent fat loss is to start with a small deficit, add exercise, then continue to cut calories if necessary as your weekly results dictate. Do it slowly and progressively in stages, not all at once.
- If you eat the right foods and do the type of training I recommend, you’ll be able to eat a lot more than you think and the fat will still melt away.

**4. Burn the fat, don’t starve the fat.**

- You can decrease your calorie intake from food or increase the calories you burn from training and other activity. Unless you’re physically unable to exercise, a combination of both is ideal. Using exercise to maintain muscle and expand your calorie deficit has huge advantages over dieting alone.
- “the fastest way to transform your body is to eat more and burn more. You eat more to provide energy, nutrients, and building material. You burn more to stoke metabolism, build muscle, gain strength, and improve fitness.
- Add the right kind of training on top of a sensible nutrition program.

**5. Use the calorie “cycling” method (don’t stay in a deficit too long).**

- Inserting occasional higher-calorie days between lower-calorie days is a simple technique that gives you a nice physical and psychological break from days or weeks of continuous deficit.
- After months of lower-calorie eating, a full week or two of higher-calorie (maintenance level) eating optimizes your hormones and restokes your metabolic fire.
- The bigger your caloric deficit has been, the longer you’ve been in it, and the lower your body fat becomes, the more important it is to take these diet breaks or “re-feeding” days.

**6. Lose weight at the right rate for you.**

- It’s important to set weekly goals thoughtfully.
- People with high body fat levels can usually drop fat faster without as many negative side effects.
- Dropping 1 percent of total body weight each week is a safe and realistic goal that’s customized for each individual.

# Chapter 1 - Fat-Burning Secrets of the Leanest People in the World

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=14.674786,121.054974)

Weight loss and fat loss are not the same thing. The scale can be misleading if it’s the only way you measure your progress, because the scale doesn’t tell you the difference between fat weight and muscle weight.

What matters most is your ratio of muscle to fat—your body composition. With this distinction in mind, losing weight should not be your only goal. Your main focus should be burning the fat and keeping the muscle. As long as your body is mostly muscle, then you shouldn’t worry so much about your total body weight.

Burn the fat with training and feed the muscle with nutrition.

The only way you’ll get lean and stay lean is to choose new behaviors, develop new habits, and maintain them for life. You’ll need a calorie deficit during your fat-loss phase, but the rest of your nutrition will be similar all year round, regardless of whether your goal is burning, building, or maintaining.

If you want to see a real miracle, try training hard and eating real food consistently for a few months. The sooner you accept this reality, the sooner you’ll be the proud owner of a lean body.
