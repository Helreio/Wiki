# 2020-02 Monthly report

## Summary

This month, I turned 28. While I was still suffering from the psychological challenges of the tinnitus, I was able to embrace my 28th year with joy. I owe this a lot from Lea but also my drive to make each day worth living for. This month, I met a lot of friends, traveled a lot, bonded with family and took responsibility of my healthcare. I also decided to go back to work, another proof that I was still functional despite my new reality.
