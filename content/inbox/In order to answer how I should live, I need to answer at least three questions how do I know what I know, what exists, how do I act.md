In order to answer how I should live, I need to answer at least three questions: how do I know what I know, what exists, how do I act

Why are these necessary?

The first two are necessary to answer the last. Epistemology is like glasses that help you see clearly. Metaphysics is about what you see in the terrain. Action theory is how you act based on what you know to be true about knowledge and the world.
