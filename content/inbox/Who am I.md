# Who am I

I am a snapshot

I am made of parts

These parts are

- Matter
- Mind
- Elements that connect the two

The I do not exist?

The mind also is made up of parts

1. The awareness
2. Its contents

If I follow logic strictly (which I ought to if I will like to make sense), then I do not really exist.

I am but a concept.

I myself am a fiction.

I am a necessary fiction.

Because if I do not believe that I exist, then I wont be able to live practically.

TRUTH

Living practically involves believing on a lot of myths
