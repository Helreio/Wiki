# Pink sheet parts are individual notes

Pink sheeting can be incorporated into the Evergreen note-writing system. Each part of the pink sheet (model, metaphor, concept, study, and story) can be an individual note.

When these individual notes come together into a pink sheet, they become one outline note. Because of this, the pink sheet process can be useful at the end of the writing process when one is about to present the concept in public. In fact, this was a primary motivation of the creators of the model.
But one could, of course, start thinking about the individual parts of the pink sheet (materials to support the main concept) early in the writing process.
