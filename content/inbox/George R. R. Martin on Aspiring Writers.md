# George R. R. Martin on Aspiring Writers

Hymline

1. Write.
2. Finish what you write.
3. Market what you write.
4. Refrain from rewriting except on editorial order.

Stop endless fiddling with your story.

If you finish your story, put it out in the market.

If an editor returns it, send it to another editor on the same day.

If you’re a young writer, start with short stories.

If you don’t know that market, start with that market.

Keep your day job.
