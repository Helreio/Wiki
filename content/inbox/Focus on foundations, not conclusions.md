# Focus on foundations, not conclusions

If you care about the accuracy of your worldview, conclusions are largely irrelevant. They are at the end of a hierarchy. Focus on the foundations (see [[A worldview is like a tree]]).

Most people wonâ€™t do this because once a worldview is already built, changing its fundamental ideas is very difficult. But if you really care for truth, you have to examine the foundations.
