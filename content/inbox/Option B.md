# Option B

Grief won't leave but there are things we can do to deal with it (beliefs and actions).

Our amount of resilience is not fixed.

Focus on how to build it.

Resilience

- Strength and speed of our response to adversity
- Strengthen the muscles around our backbone

3 things that will detriment growth

1. Personalization
2. Pervasiveness
3. Permanence

You wil recover if

1. You believe everything is not your fault
2. That what happened does not affect a parts of your life
3. That the effects of what happened will not last forever.

Remove "never" from your vocabulary.

We have evolved to handle grief.

Embrace your grief emotions.

Do not fight them.

Chapter 3

People need a button then know they can press when in crisis.

Just show up for someone in crisis. Be the button. No need to talk.

There's no one way to grieve and one way to comfort.

Give comfort to those closest to the tragedy.

Seek comfort to those farther from where you are relative to the tragedy.

Elizabeth Ross

5 states of grief not in linear fashion

"We" are gonna get through this.

Be ready to carry the trouble of your friends too.

Chapter 4

Self compassion determines success in moving on from a failed relationship.

Shame correlates with unhealthy behavior.

Each of us is greater than what wrong we've done.

Write or journal tragediea.
