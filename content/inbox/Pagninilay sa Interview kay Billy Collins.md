# Pagninilay sa Interview kay Billy Collins

I’ll start with this quote from the article:

"I say, Get rid of it. Because if it got into a later poem it would be Scotch-taped on. It would not be part of the organic, you know, chi, the spine that the poem has, the way it all should be one continuous movement. Poems that lack that seem very mechanically put together, like a piece here and a part there."

I have some reservations for what he said here partly because I do blackout poetry and by their nature blackout poems are scotch-taped poems. Their mechanical nature is what makes them different. And the reason why I like them is because I don’t have to stress a lot about being original when I do them. I could experience a little stress with looking for patterns between words, but at least I am taking a rest from the stress of trying to be original all the time. Of course, it isn’t impossible for a blackout poem to suddenly emerge like a traditional poem with characteristic of having a continuum (what he describes here as “chi"). However, what if it doesn’t have this? Is it a bad poem? Was my process of coming up with it a wrong way of doing poetry even if I enjoyed doing the process?

These questions led me to think about how we actually judge a poem. We can criticize a poem by not having this element of chi but isn’t our criticism of that poem subjective, based on our biases and tastes? What if a poet wrote that mechanical poem in a maginhawa way, he felt maginhawa while writing the poem, do we say that his work is not good?

This made me ask, by describing how writing poetry happens, are we also prescribing a “right way” to write poetry, like what formalists have done for a very long time?

Tapos, this made me ask, "Sino ang ultimate judge ng gawa ng isang makatang nagsusulat ng maginhawa?”

The way I see it, may dalawa lang naman:

- Ang kaniyang sarili
- O ibang tao (in our case, mga katungko, ibang makata na hindi katungko, at ang madla na mambabasa)

I thought about how this judging process happens and nilagay ko sa following table yung dumapo sa’kin:

Judge #1: Sarili

Judge #2: Mga KaTungko

Judge #3: Mga Makatang labas sa Tugko

Judge #4: Masa o Karaniwang Tao

Makata

“Maginhawa akong nakapagsulat ng tula. Nagtagumpay ako."

Ibang Tao

“Maginhawa raw niyang naisulat ang kaniyang tula. Nagtagumpay na siya. Bagaman may mga naisip rin kaming pwede niyang gawin upang makaginhawa sa’min at sa ibang maaring bumasa ng kaniyang tula."

“Palpak!"

“Nakagiginhawa!”(kapag madaling maunawaan)

“‘Di ko gets” (kapag medyo malalim)

From here, I realized na ang ultimate na husgado sa gawa ng isang makata ay ang kaniyang sarili. At ang dahilan ay ang tagumpay ay parating subjective muna bago objective. Pwedeng mag-impose ang anumang outside body (like grupo ng mga makata like LIRA; ang Tungko ay grupo rin ng mga makata) pero anumang iimpose ng isang grupo ay objective standards at hindi necessarily na standards ng individual. Kaya bagaman makakatulong ang feedback ng iba, bagaman may gamit ang objective standards ng isang grupo, kailangan munang makapagtiwala ang makata sa kaniyang sariling kakayahan, sa kaniyang sariling standards. Ang tungko ay kailangang maiba sa ibang grupo sa pamamagitan ng pagembrace ng attitude na ito. Bagaman mahalaga ang feedback ng mga KaTungko at ng Karaniwang Taong babasa, hindi dapat palitan ng mga ito ang pinakaimportanteng husgado sa lahat: ang sarili. Dahil kapag hindi natutunan ng makata na magtiwala sa kaniyang sarili, hindi siya makasusulat. At sabi ni Billy Collins sa same article, ang pinakaimportante sa lahat ay nakapagsusulat ka.

"Actually, I don’t think you can be really badly influenced by anyone, as long as it makes you write."

This brings me to my next pagninilay. Natanong ko na sa iyo dati ang tungkol sa puwang ng formalism sa Tungko at nasagot mo ito ng mataginting. May panibago akong twist sa tanong na ito. As a thought experiment, imagine mo na kunwari sasali si Sir Rio sa Tungko (or sinumang poet na highly intellectual magsulat). At sa pagsali niya sasabihin niyang gusto niyang sumali sa grupo dahil sa emphasis nito sa maginhawang pagsusulat. Gusto niyang makaramdam na nageenjoy siya kapag nagsusulat siya. Sa pag-alis sa LIRA o sa anumang grupong masakit maghusga, sa tingin niya ay giginhawa siya. At giginhawa nga talaga siya dahil wala ng strong standards at harsh judgements. Pero heto ang problema, intellectual pa rin siyang magsulat at hindi maginhawa sa ibang babasa. Noong ibring up natin ito, ang sabi niya, “Subalit, maginhawa sa akin ang pagsusulat ng ganitong mga tula at hindi maginhawa sa akin ang pagsusulat ng maginhawang mga tula.” Ano ang isasagot natin sa kaniya? Sasabihin ba natin na sorry goodbye, mga intuitive poems lang ang pwede rito. Bawal ang mahahabang hindi magets na mga tula? Kapag ganun ang attitude natin, facilitative pa rin ba tayo o prescriptive na? Anong pinagkaiba natin sa LIRA?

Sa akin, clear ang sagot. For a poetry group to be truly maginhawa, it should be a space where there is less and less constraints. At siyempre iquoquote ko ang Tao Te Ching mo rito:

**“Sa pagdami ng mga bawal,**

**dumarami ang naghihirap."**

Lesser rules means there is more space for ALL kinds of poetry. Even the super formalist poems should be welcome. Experimental poems should be welcome (like blackouts). Intellectual poems should not be looked down on. This means that Tungko becomes a space of true freedom. It does not prescribe strongly on anything. If there is any prescription, an organizing principle that binds everything, it is only this:

“Maginhawa ka bang nagsusulat? Ok. That’s it.”

If you add on that, then you add constraints that could muddle the very essence of what maginhawa is: the subjective maginhawa experience of an individual poet should be the ultimate principle.

The role of freedom in poetry was nicely said by Collins sa quote na ito sa article:

I grew by allowing aspects of myself that I had previously excluded into the poetry. I think all poets—younger poets particularly—have a private sense of decorum, meaning they feel there are certain things they should write about and other things they shouldn’t.

My dream is for poetry to be freeing and if Tungko evolves into that place where we are free to explore the different parts of us then what a treat. That no topic is out of the conversation. No form is out of experimentation. Of course, there are intricacies of this and we shouldn’t expect Tungko to immediately be like this. But it’s a nice dream. I also think that this should be one of the main goals of Tungko and Ginhawa poetics to live up to its critique of traditional poetry. To be truly an alternative way, it has to be freeing, it should be as much as possible prevent creating rules on what should be and what shouldn’t be explored. It would be nice to see that each KaTungko is exploring their own topics and their own structures and there should be a venue for them in Tungko to show their work: they should be given the time to share during gatherings or they should be given space in the website to show their work. We need to give them voice and there shouldn’t be censorship as much as possible.

Ang mga usaping ito ties well together with my meditations on community. Here is an interesting quote from the article that jumps into this:

For me poetry was always a solo act. A romantic idea maybe, but I thought that poetry was something you did in solitude, and the idea of sharing your work with anybody was completely antithetical to what I thought poetry was all about.

Naisip ko, I think the challenge for Tungko is how can it be a place of community that does not muddle with the solitude that poetry requires? How can we be "alone together" in Tungko? This is something the Quakers do, which I first heard from Parker Palmer. How can Tungko be a space where an individual’s need for community and need for authenticity is both fulfilled? In some way, it is already able to do this. But how can it do a better job?

Sa pagtatapos, I think I want to highlight again this tension between the poet as the Self and the poet as a member of a group. In the article, Billy Collins see this tension:

The image one has to present as a performer, as an interviewee and whatnot, is a very different self from the sensibility that actually creates the poems. You need to keep your center, the part that writes the poems, and not spin off into popularity.

Personally, ito ang matagal ko nang pinagninilayan. Every time I show up to the world, a part of me is lost. This is expected, pero what I wish to have is a community, a space where the potential damages of sharing my work to others is lessened, is minimized. Parang insurance ba.

Malaki na ang naitulong ng Tungko sa proseso na ito. At mag-aagree ang ibang mga kaTungko. Ang tanging wish ko ay sa paglaki ng grupo, sana manatiling priority nito ang pagpapanatili ng isang safe space kung saan ang proseso ng indibiduwal member ang pinakaimportanteng asset. At ang mga nabanggit ko rito ay ilan sa mga naisip kong ideas on how that might be able to happen.
