# Transition Checklist

Notes:

- The most effective method for dealing with the side effects of acid reflux is addresing the root causes: low acidity and poor digestive efficiency.
- The length of each phase depend on personal factors such as your diet, the extent of your digestive dysfunction, and your stomach’s acidity.
- A successful transition means paying attention to your body so you can adapt and adjust as necessary.
- Do not change too many things at once so you can tell what is going in your body.

# Phase 1: Revise (2 weeks) - Establish your baseline

## Goals

1. Closure of the esophageal sphincter
2. Efficient digestion
3. Minimal to no reflux events

## Checklist

### Food

- [ ] Temporarily eliminate common reflux triggers from your diet (processed foods, fatty foods, fried foods, alcohol, high sugar, pepper, garlic, raw onions, spicy food, chocolate, citrus, caffeine, mint, and tomato).
- [ ] Eat a diverse diet full of fiber and prebiotic (vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains).
- [ ] Add 'naturally fermented' foods to your daily diet (pickles, sourdough, kimchi) especially plain, no sugar added yogurt. For an internationally friendly list visit [https://theacidrefluxguy.com/fermented](https://theacidrefluxguy.com/fermented)
- [ ] Chew your food excessively until you pulverize your food before swallowing.
- [ ] Do not overeat.
- [ ] Eat 1/2 cup of yogurt after meals.
- [ ] Take note of what you eat / drink and how it makes you feel; take note of and eliminate any additional food triggers that you identify.
- [ ] Get a thermal cup and drink lots of warm water through the day.

### Exercise

- [ ] Exercise: 10,000 steps a day.

### Sleep

- [ ] Sleep properly.
   - [ ] Ensure you eat 2-3 hours before going to bed.
   - [ ] Sleep on your left side.
   - [ ] Elevate your body with a wedge pillow.
   - [ ] Sleep enough hours.

### Others

- [ ] Manage stress and mental health.
- [ ] Use baking soda as toothpaste.
- [ ] Near the end of week 2, take one 500 mg essential enzyme capsule in the middle of meals.

# Phase 2: Restore (4–6 weeks) - Rebuild digestive balance

## Goals

1. Leverage supplements to temporarily simulate the body’s normal digestive function, restore sphincter function, eliminate indigestion, rebalance gut flora

## Checklist

- [ ] Take one 500 mg apple cider vinegar capsule with meals.
- [ ] Take one 500 mg essential enzyme capsule with meals.
- [ ] Take one to seven 650 mg betaine hydrochloride + pepsins capsules with meals, according to size and complexity of the meal. Increase with subsequent meals until it controls your symptoms. If you notice discomfort take less for similar meal next time.
   - [ ] Start with one 650 mg in the middle of your largest meal (usually dinner). Take the first capsule with a meal containing protein.
   - [ ] If you do not feel an improvement in your digestion, try two capsules the next day, with a similar sized meal.
   - [ ] Experiment. You will know if you are taking enough if it is helping to control your reflux symptoms.
   - [ ] Doses: 2-3 for dinner, 4-5 for very high protein meals, and 1-2 for breakfast and lunch.
   - [ ] Increase dose by one pill each day until you reach 5-7 or you feel a warming sensation in your gut, whichever comes first.
   - [ ] When the warming sensation comes, decrease your dose by one pill for similar sized meals. When you find the ideal dose, continue taking the supplements with up to three meals daily.
   - [ ] If there is no warming sensation, your test is the improvement of your digestion. If not, increase by one capsule.
   - [ ] Also, if you notice a return of reflux symptoms or stomach discomfort this is a signal to reduce the number of HCl capsules you take with meals
   - [ ] Every few days, decrease by one capsule per meal if digestive issues return, then add them back.
   - [ ] Continue reducing the dose until you reach zero capsule with meals.
- [ ] Continue eating your plain, trigger free diet.
- [ ] Continue taking notes and making adjustments based on reflux symptoms that you observe.
- [ ] Continue eating the yogurt and fermented foods.
- [ ] Continue drinking the warm water.
- [ ] Once you have reached zero HCl capsules in the restore phase you can stop taking all supplements.

# Phase 3: Renew Phase (2+ weeks) - Reintroduce problem foods

## Goals

1. Stop taking the supplements.
2. Slowly reintroduce your normal diet.

## Checklist

- [ ] Slowly re-introduce foods that you have not eaten during the transition phase. As you reintroduce foods, take note how they affect you.
   - [ ] If some foods still give you trouble, look into a probiotic that targets that specific intolerance.
- [ ] Hold onto the supplements in case you start to feel some of the early symptoms of reflux again in the future; if you catch it early a day or two on the supplements and some yogurt can put you back in
balance.
- [ ] Celebrate! But take care to avoid the risk factors that initiated your reflux in the first place. For a refresher, you can review the epidemiology chapter/risk factors chapter of my book.
