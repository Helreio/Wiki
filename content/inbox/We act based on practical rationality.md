# We act based on practical rationality

In [[thoughts/my worldview]], [[morality is a fiction]]. We don't really act based on morality. How do we explain the reason behind our actions then?

We do what we do based on practical reasons, or more accurately, we act based on our preferences. In turn, [[Our preferences are consequences of our subjective experiences]] (mental states that make us feel good, mental states that make us feel bad, and the accumulation of these [[Mental state]]s).

[[thoughts/majority of life is subjective experiences]]. Because most of what we do are subjective, they shouldnâ€™t be prescribed to others. Our choice of lifestyle could definitely be the best choice for us. But it is not for everyone.

To do

- The note looks okay, but the arguments backing the claim are insufficient. Provide more proofs and arguments that preferences are what drive human behavior.
