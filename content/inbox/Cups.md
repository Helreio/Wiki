# Cups

Of different flavors

Fighting for the crown

The gold jeweled crown

Where to put it?

This crown of thorns

On the head

Of the most joyous clouds

Living is but a plot

A story so boring

That we need tales

And poems

To save us from ourselves

The good life

The beautiful life

Is but a game of cups

The pouring of liquid gold

Into imaginary buckets

To live is to fill each cup

As long as one is able

And to destroy some cups

If it is necessary

For one

To finally

Live
