# Loving Self or Loving Others—Which Is More Important?

Loving Self or Loving Others—Which Is More Important?

Recently, a good friend of mine emailed me a question. She said it’s a question that has been bothering her for a long time. The question is this:

Which is more important—loving oneself or loving others?”

The question is already thought-provoking but she added a second more challenging extension of the puzzle:

If you are in a situation where you need to choose just one, which would you choose?

Like my good friend, the first question has been a question that has bothered me for a very, very long time.

Love Is Blind…To The “Self”

I was raised in a Christian evangelical family and as children we were taught that love, as exemplified by Jesus, was putting the interests of others first before one’s own. This teaching became very strong within my consciousness when I started to take the religion of my childhood seriously around the time I was starting college.

As I was nearing the third year of my tertiary education, I was heavily involved in a voluntary educational campaign that taught basic education and Bible knowledge to unschooled deaf, mute, and hard of hearing individuals. I did this alongside my undergraduate studies and it involved a lot of sacrifices, where my money, time, and effort went to the interests of my students first before myself. While many of these sacrifices were very stressful, I viewed them as genuine obedience to Jesus’ teachings and example, so they brought me deep inner joy.

Well, that’s until I burnt out in 2011, got depressed, and changed my life 360 degrees.

Depression has a way of putting you on your knees and forcing you to focus on yourself. It’s what I did for about a year before I felt better and more capable of doing things again.

While I learned a thing or two about self-care during my one-year hiatus, I was yet to completely understand my lesson. When I got back to school in 2012, I sought for the old drug that satisfied my lust for serving. I went back to helping the deaf community, now as an independent sign language interpreter and community organizer. I helped the Baguio City deaf community organize itself and advocated for its interests particularly in the area of tertiary education. Alongside this, I also joined a political party at school where I managed projects related to student welfare, mental health, and reproductive health. Outside the religion of my childhood, I found ways of serving and the narrative that ran inside my head was the same:

Loving others is more important than loving the self.”

No wonder, for the second time, I burnt out. I left serving the deaf community, I stopped participating in student politics, and I began retreating within myself. I started exploring mindfulness and yoga, and re-explored my lost interest to creativity and art.

So, Which Is More Important?

My subjective experience tells me that extreme loving for others is like smoking—it’s dangerous to my health. On the other hand, my exposure to alternative spiritual communities showed me that loving oneself can also be taken to extreme levels where people are focused entirely on their self-actualization, forgetting about their loved ones, their community, and the benefits of interconnectedness.

So my choice would be the middle way—a way of life where self-love and service counterbalances each other.

But of course, my good friend was asking me to choose one given a situation where I have to choose one, right?

Before I can make a choice I need to clarify a few things. Let’s begin with my understanding of the “self” and of “others.”

What Is The Self? What Is The Other?
