# OB - Helen Fisher: Love and Sex and Attachment

Parts of the brain related to decision making shuts down when in love

Love is different from lust

Romantic love evolved where you overlook everything so you can focus on this person

Why does it die out?

It takes a lot of metabolic energy to be in a relationship

Don't marry your gf until that intensity has worn off

You dont know the true person until about 18 months are over

A good marriage evolves

Everyone should have 3 marriages even if with the same person

1. Sex
2. Children
3. Companionship

People are beginning to take commitment slowly because they are becoming more cautious

Expanding precommitment stage

New for of family: the association (group of friends living together)

It is more evolutionarily natural to date someone without researching her

The modern nuclear family isolated from extended family is like a death blow to marriage

In hunter gathering societies, associations are more common.

In farming sedentary societies, marrying and nuclear families are more common.

The basic human desire to love is so important that we created institutions like marriage to support it.

The more we learn about our neurobiology the more we understand the power of culture to change that biology.

Casual sex is not casual

The chemicals released in you conspires for you to get attached or in love or both to this person

Dont have sex with somebody you dont want to feel something for

You might end up with the wrong person in ur life

"We are lied to by our love songs"

Young people are getting more and more serious about their relationships

They want everything in the relationship

They are afraid of divorce

Men

- Fall in love faster
- More visual
- Want more public show of affection
- Want to introduce partner to friends and family sooner
- Want to move in sooner

Men are just as romantic

Women are just as sexual

To love somebody released from all that passion - to let them go and spend time with others - can be very comforting not just for them but also for you.

Then you can build new kinds of partnerships with them.
