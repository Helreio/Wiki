# Anti-marketing

It is better to use anti-marketing when using a [[Patronage model]] in building sustainability for one's creative work.

To do this, one should consider the following guidelines by [[Andy Matuschak]]:

- Be brutally honest about your progress.
- Focus publicly on the least rosy parts of your projects—what’s confusing, frustrating, not working.
- Transform interesting challenges into something positive: useful fodder for public conversation.

This builds a deeper, more authentic relationship with your audience. This works even better when paired with [[thoughts/work with the garage door up]].

Andy says that he first heard of this from his research partner [[Michael Nielsen]]. At first glance, I thought anti-marketing is similar to [[Unmarketing]], which I first learned from [[Scott Straten]]’s book. While anti-marketing and unmarketing shares a disgust of traditional marketing (pushy, salesy, interuptive marketing), anti-marketing seems simpler and more undeveloped. Surprisingly, people are already using the term but seemingly in a different way than Nielsen.

To do

- Give support to the claims you made in the last paragraph.
