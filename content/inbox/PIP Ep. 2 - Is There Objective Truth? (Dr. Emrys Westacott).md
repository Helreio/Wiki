# PIP Ep. 2 - Is There Objective Truth? (Dr. Emrys Westacott)

*Do you think everything is ultimately subjective?*

**EW**

Not everything is subjective.

There is objective truth.

There is an objective reality (you die when you jump off a building).

We can't live without the concept of objective truth.

We can't live without the concept of free will.

We can't live without the concepts of truth and falsehood.

In the level of every day life, truth is what corresponds to reality accurately.

This is challenged in the level of philosophical discourse.

- How do we decide whether a statement accurately describes reality?
- We have certain criteria: epistemic norms (ex. Coherence with other beliefs)
- But how do we know that the criteria we use are the best ones?
- Other people have their own epistemic norms that we don't necessarily adhere to. But how do we show that our norms are better?
- Ultimately, you will come to a point where you can't demonstrate with a conclusive argument that your epistemic norm is better. Because all arguments require premises. You can only demonstrate something if the other person agrees with your premise.
- If you can’t make the other person agree, then you have failed in making a conclusion that your epistemic norm is better. What you can only do is to make your point of view persuasive.
- These appeals are pragmatic, not mathematical conclusive statements.

*Do you reject a fundamental epistemic foundation?*

It’s possible that human beings may agree on one set of epistemic norms.

Even if humanity ultimately converge into agreeing to one epistemic norm, that doesn't prove that the norm is giving you the truth.

*Does social convention determine epistemic methodology?*

**SP**

There are certainly epistemic norms in terms of describing how people arrive at their conclusions. Certain groups have epistemic norms. But these norms are objectively flawed to arrive at known conclusions.

Example

- You have a dartboard.
- You put a bunch of propositions on the dartboard.
- You throw the dart on the dartboard.
- You believe that wherever it lands that proposition is true.

::One might descriptively say with accuracy that certain people have certain epistemic norms.::

::But one can also “objectively" say that these norms are not a sound way of arriving at truth.::

**EW**

I believe one could objectively judge whether an epistemic norm is flawed or not.

But even so, one can’t absolutely conclusively prove that I’m right and they’re wrong.

**SP**

What if you don’t care about proving to the other person?

What if what you only care about is proving to your own internal knowledge?

I know that they’re wrong. They will never know they’re wrong. But I’m okay with that as well.

**EW**

I believe in certain criteria that will lead me to beliefs that can be very useful in coping with the world.

There are people who don’t share those criteria.

They’re just false.

Doesn’t it say something if I can’t prove my point to them? That all I can say is they’re false?

**SP**

::There are superior and inferior ways of searching truth as there are superior and inferior ways of playing chess.::

::Using your criteria, you can conclusively prove that you’re right and they’re wrong (at least for your own satisfaction).::

There is a concept.

A agrees. B disagrees.

A and B looks into the definition of the concept and both acknowledges that it is right.

But B still disagrees.

Does this mean that there is no objective concept?

**EW**

On one hand, you have a straight disagreement. You can’t persuade them.

On the other hand, you can’t not say to yourself that you are right and they’re wrong.

**SP**

If your interest is to know the truth for your own self then the conclusion is conclusive.

::In the lone philosopher perspective, can you say confidently in some circumstances, regardless of my ability to persuade anybody, regardless of how many agrees to this proposition, that they’re objectively wrong and I’m objectively right?::

**EW**

I think you just have to accept that you can’t always demonstrate that what you say is true as it were from a God’s standpoint of the universe.

**SP**

::Proposition: In no part of the universe is there a square circle.::

Question: Is this conclusive in a God’s point of view?

**EW**

Pragmatically yes there is no square circle.

But this is not Cartesian certainty.

**SP**

There is a difference between

- This is a belief central to our worldview, and
- This is a belief that accurately describes reality

I am interested in the most extreme facts, conclusive objective truths.

::Proposition: The phenomenon of perception is undeniably happening. Subjective experience is going on.::

Isn’t it a foundational belief? Couldn't we use this absolutely certain proposition as a foundational premise?

**EW**

Yes, you can’t avoid saying that your subjective experience is a reality.

But it doesn’t mean that it’s a foundation of a systematic edifice of knowledge.

Descartes dream is that the objectivity that attaches to the cognitive extends towards the entire system. Philosophers who followed Descartes have obsessed far too much to this certainty.

I’m happier with philosophical truths that are mere generalizations, probabilities, plausibilities. They can still be insightful, interesting, and useful.

**SP**

::There are certain truths that build a certain framework.::

- ::Metaphysics: Subjective experience is happening.::
- ::Logic: Experiencing couldn’t be happening were it not the case that experience is happening. This implies a logical identity.::

::But these certain truths won’t get you very far.::

::So you fill in the details with less certain idea.::

**EW**

Framework and foundation are metaphors.

I’m content to believe in the proposition that subject experience is happening now.

On one hand, that’s interesting. On the other hand, so what? How does that affect the certainty of ordinary empirical beliefs and scientific theories?

**SP**

::If you believe in the certainty of the proposition of subjective experience, then aren’t you implying that the mind has access to some God’s point of view perspective.::

::The objectivity of subjectivity::

1. ::Perception is happening.::
2. ::I am right.::
3. ::Whoever denies this is wrong.::

**EW**

Objective truth is truth which is true regardless of our subjective beliefs.

In the philosophical point of view regarding knowledge in general, I am inclined towards an snti-realist, pragmatist position.

- Any description of the world that we give is going to be description our language, our concepts, our theories, our belief systems.
- You cannot describe reality independent of your experience.
- Your perspective is relative.
- Whatever objective truth you uncover is again relative to something.
- Kant, William James, Putman

**SP**

::For the majority of propositions, that is the case.::

::We can’t escape the framing of our concepts.::

::But the word “experience” or “perception” is a visual representation of a concept.::

::But what I mean by that concept is something that is in the world. It has an objective referent. It is something out there that is happening.::

::Perception is a thing that is out there. I am only describing it through certain words.::

::Even if i dont conceptualize, that phenomena will still be happening.::

::We have access to the objective and we have access to the subjective. Because we can make claims to both with certainty.::

::Example::

::Imagine that we can’t describe the phenomena of experience because of our language.::

::The phenomena will still be taking place.::

::But we can’t talk about it. We can’t conceptualize it.::

::Couldn’t we say that even if we don’t understand what is happening, it’s still taking place.::

::It’s true in the grand perspective.::

::It’s inescapable.::

**EW**

I accept the indubitability of subjective experience.

But what I can’t accept is that you can construct your Lord Cabin through this.

Yes there are ideas that we can assert with greater or lesser certainty.

But it doesn’t follow that that certainty percolates upwards.

**SP**

::Proposition: EW does not know everything that is to know in the universe. There are some knowledge and information that you EW does not possess. Is it something that you can know with certainty?::

::If this proposition is true then that’s step two!::

::If what I said is true then this implies that we can describe reality with certainty using the knowledge that certain propositions provide.::

This could start the snowball of what Descartes wants to do.

**EW**

But we have only discovered

- Something is going on.
- And it’s not everything.

When you start using “selves” you have some work to do to start explaining what you mean by those terms.
