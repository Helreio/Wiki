# Why I’m retiring Lilim

- I feel resistance doing it. And it is not the kind of resistance that indicates this is the work I need to do. It’s a bad kind of resistance—the one that tells you you are not enjoying what you are doing.
- It feels forced.
- It’s no longer exciting.
- Even if it is a weekly opportunity to express my truth, I still feel unexpressed.
- The personal truth I want to express is not yet ready.
- I am forced to show up, but the quality of the work is not that good.
- I just piece things together haphazardly just to have something to send. I don’t like that feeling. I want to do something that I can really feel the passion in me.
