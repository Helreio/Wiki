# You can be happy without being philosophical

One is not required to be philosophical to be happy or to feel [[Ginhawa]]. And most people won’t. Even [[The Buddha avoided metaphysics]] and philosophizing and, instead, focused on developing compassion. This is because analytical philosophy—when done without the sincere search for truth and respect to other people's freedom to believe—could lead to hatred and even violence ([[We agree about what we want and disagree about metaphysics and epistemology]]).

That said, a very specific kind of person feels like he “needs” to understand the universe and needs to know the truth before he can be happy. That person does not see [[thoughts/happiness]] as the only or ultimate goal. For him, [[thoughts/meaning]] is equally if not more important.
