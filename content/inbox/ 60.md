Sometimes we make sudden decisions based on our gut that we are sure off. In these instances, we don’t do much deliberation and careful comparison. In these instances, while there is no deliberation, there is a long time soaking in the discomfort of the status quo. The accumulates mental states of discomfort has been too familiar due to continuous reconstruction. This is enough impetus to make one decide.

This is a slow and inefficient decision-making process. But the decision made during this time is more accurate—perhaps the most accurate decision ever.
