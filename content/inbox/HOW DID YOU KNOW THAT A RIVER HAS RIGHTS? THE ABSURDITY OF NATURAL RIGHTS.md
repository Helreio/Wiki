# HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT A RIVER HAS RIGHTS? THE ABSURDITY OF NATURAL RIGHTS

It is one thing to say:

A: "We convene and decide that a river will have its rights."

and anther thing to say:

B: "The river by itself has its rights."

If both claims are challenged by the question: "How did you know?"

A will answer: "We know because we sat down and decided about it."

Nothing problematic in this explanation. It is clear, simple, and straightforward.

B, on the other hand, will be forced to make a claim such as: "I know because the river spoke to me and said its has rights."

This is a very absurd answer. But is there any alternative? If there is, it will be as absurd as this answer.

If you did not convene and decide to give a river its rights, how did you know it has rights of its own?

This is the absurdity of the belief in objective natural rights, which is not very different from the belief in an objective morality.
