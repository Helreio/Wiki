# My metaphysical position

My current metaphysical position is as follows:

1. [[an external objective physical world exists]].
2. [[The external physical world is made up of countless individual units of matter]]
3. Aside from these countless individual units of matter, [[Minds exists]].
4. [[The interaction between the external objective physical world and the mind creates subjective experience]]. Because [[Minds are unique to each human being]], [[thoughts/subjective experiences are unique to each human being]].
