# The Masculinity Paradox: Developing Sexual Integrity in Men by David Ley

Book: The Myth of Sex Addiction

We approach male sexuality with distrust. This approach makes things worse and makes it more difficult to change.

Most sex therapists look at sexuality assuming pathology.

Males use sexuality to meet deeper needs for acceptance, love, and vulnerability. Males use sexuality to overcome shame for a body that was different.

We pathologize men who use sexuality these way because we think sexuality shouldn’t be used that way.

Sex criminals use sex from a place of fear, lost, and need.

Our sexual behavior is an expression of unmet needs.

When sexuality issues are present, we over-attend to them. = Sexual Shiny Object Syndrome

- When sex is there, we focus on that, with the exclusion of a context.

We always need to look at the context when tackling sexual problems.

Porn and sex addicts don’t watch more porn than anybody else. They just feel more worse about it. Why? Because of the moral conflict between what they want to do and what they were taught is okay to do.

Stopping sexual thoughts increase their potency. When we repress them, they become stronger and more frequent.

If you were taught to be ashamed and hate yourself for your sexual thoughts, your self-hatred and shame increases.

It is exhausting and counterproductive to fight the negatives.

Instead of thinking about the things that we need to stop, think about the things we need to improve more:

A

Questions

- Who is your sexual role model?
- Who taught you how to integrate your sexuality into your identity?

Heterosexual men can’t answer this question. Homosexual men can easily answer this question because they have to wrestle with it constantly.

There are very little sexual role models. We only hear about a person’s sexuality when it is a problem.

5% of men who watch violent pornography, want to reenact it. 95% don’t.

- These men have antisocial personality traits, do substance abuse, exhibit hostile masculinity, and misogyny.

When you tell people not to do something, you increase their chance of doing it. But they will keep it a secret to you.

Look at the context, and improve what can be improved there.

You can only have orgasm if you are relaxed. You can be relaxed if you give up control and trust your sexual partner.

Development of sexual integrity

You can’t have an honest and healthy sexual relationship, unless you are willing to accept and acknowledge your sexual needs event those scary dark ones.

If you have expressed your sexual needs and your partner rejected you, you have to start asking: is this truly an honest healthy relationship?

Think about your sexuality when you are not turned on. How do your sexual fantasies and behavior make you feel?

- If you are ashamed, that's we're you need to start doing the work.
- Shame is the secret well-spring from where all these problems flow.
- Shame is what will prevent you to consider your behavior wisely.

You can control your urges when you are not horny and tired, by curating your environment beforehand to lessen the strength of those urges.

Instead of fighting your sexual desires, redirect it.

The porn you watch reflect sexual fantasises and unmet needs in your life.

Klein Sexual Orientation Grid

- It is possible that you just want to have sex with a certain kind of person, but you don't want to love that person.

The healthy reaction when you feel your sexual urges is to have the autonomy to not act on it uncontrollably or feel bad about it. You can only do that if you don’t repress and supress these thoughts.

Developing empathy and understanding of men who use sex to harm others is not an excuse of their behaviors. It is how we help them learn how to change.

Going at war with your sexuality, suppressing it, strengthens your sexual issues.

Do we want revenge or do we want change?

- You can only choose one. If you want change, find ways to celebrate and acknowledge the wonderful aspects of sexuality in you.
