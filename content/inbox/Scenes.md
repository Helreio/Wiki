History

All creatures came from one place

At the center of the archipelago

The first men created one language

The first men created the first ili

The first men created the first awit

The awit became lengthy, it was impossible for even the best babaylan to memorize

The entire awit was divided among families, babaylans thru the ages would memorize each portion of the awit.

The first ili has rules protecting

- The land
- The creatures
- The minds of human beings
- The bodies of human beings

Because the first ili placed an emphasis on freedom more than anything else, families as they grew had to spread out of the central island. Societal laws required families and clans to limit their population, so that resources are used efficiently and the holistic development of each person is assured.

Each life is sacred.

In the first days of the world when men were few, each child will be accompanied by an adult to visit a nearby ili to listen to the other parts of the song.

Ideally, everyone was a whole human being, physically capable and mentally sharp.

- Present the status quo
- A babaylan recites/sings a song detailing the origins of the universe

He leaves 3 behind and brings out the sharp knife he created.
