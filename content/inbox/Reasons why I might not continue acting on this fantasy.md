# Reasons why I might not continue acting on this fantasy

The fantasy seems better than reality.

I am too sensitive to acting this out in reality.

There is a risk that my gf will build emotions with a bull.

I felt guilt and no peace of mind when I was thinking about sex within the context of being a JW. When I left the church, and I was already having regular sex with my gf, all those guillt and anxiety were gone and I had equilibrium. All of a sudden, I have relegated my sexuality in the background. Once that need was satisfied, I just focused on other things. The cuckold experience has broken that peace of mind, and that is why I doubt if I really want to continue in it.
