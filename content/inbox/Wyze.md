My smart scale

failed to connect

with its mobile app

this morning.

I could not

measure the weight

of the world's burden.

I could not

measure the weight

of a mother's tears,

a child's shrieking,

a father's sweat.

I contacted support

but the queue was

too long,

number 59 I was.

Perhaps,

as if by an evil hand,

hundreds got their scales

broken

and no one,

no one,

can measure the world's burden.
