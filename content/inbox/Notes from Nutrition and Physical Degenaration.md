# Notes from Nutrition and Physical Degenaration

How did Price identified his research sample?

The following are the groups studied by Westprice:

- the Swiss of Switzerland
- the Gaelics in the Outer and Inner Hebrides
- the Eskimos of Alaska
- the Indians in the far North, West and Central Canada, Western United States and Florida
- the Melanesians and Polynesians on eight archipelagos of the Southern Pacific
- tribes in eastern and central Africa
- the Aborigines of Australia
- Malay tribes on islands north of Australia
- the Maori of New Zealand and the ancient civilizations and their descendants in Peru both along the coast and in the Sierras, also in the Amazon Basin

He compared primitive samples and modernized samples of each group.

Westprice concluded that his sample displayed high immunity against diseases common in modern civilization as long as they remained isolated and contnued their indigenous nutritional traditions.

Children born from families who adopted modern nutrition developed degenerative processes primarily because both of their parents already had defective physical conditions before conception.

The degenerative processes Westprice discovered were primarily physical injuries. However, these led to individual personality disturbances like lower than normal mental efficiency, inferiority complex, and delinquency.

Price discovered that in many groups, girls went through a six month period of special nutrition before marriage. This suggested that they were aware of the effects of nutrition to conception.

The forces of heredity are not all powerful. They can be intercepted by environment.

According to Price, the origin of personality and character is bilogic, which is primarily dictated by the nutrition of both parents and the nutritional environment where they live in (e.g., soil depletion). If he is right, then a poor nutritional environment will cause poor personality in a mass level. The best way to correct this is to correct the nutritional environment, the very source of all this degeneration.

From Price research, he found that the last child in a large family suffer the most, with usually a different facial form after adopting a modern type of nutrition.
