# We Are Not Our Jobs

I’ve argued about this before. For many, many times already. I’ve been passionate about the subject, both in writing and in conversations among friends and family, that I’ve even chose to start a career according to it.

But I say it again here.

Because a friend needs it. And I think you might just need a little nudge too.

**We are not our jobs. And whether we like it or not, we never will be.**

It is ingrained within our very nature as human beings to be more than one thing. All of us are renaissance men and women in the truest sense. You’re just denying it, shutting down, not believing on yourself - but it’s the truth! You have a too awesome brain that is wired to make you just that - too awesome! All of us, even the most feeble or broken member of our race, are geared to fall in love, to be skilled, and to do more than one thing.

So why caged ourselves to “just” being our job?

Why do we live our lives as if our only calling is that which brings money inside our pockets?

We are more than that!

Do you really like that as an identity?

I am not just a researcher or editor. I am a writer, an aspiring author, a disability advocate, a spiritual man, a quiet leader (not to mention a closet artist, lyricist, poet, basketball player, runner, and cyclist). But more importantly, I am a son, I am a brother, I am a cousin, and a friend.

You have a similar collection of assorted identities and all of these identities are encapsulated into that one beautiful entity called YOU.

So why do you spend 90% or more of your waking hours at work?

Why do you still bring your work at home in front of your spouse and children when they’re waiting for you to talk to them?

Why can’t you have coffee with a friend who needs someone to talk to during the weekends? C’mon! It’s already the weekends!

And during that so awkward moment at the party when someone asks you “what do you do?” why are you always compelled (as if pushed by an invisible hand that it leaves you so powerless to resist) to say that:

“Well, I’m…I’m a [insert high-paying but soul-crushing job here]."

Why can’t you say: “Well, you know what, I do paper flowers. I’m so passionate about paper flower craftwork! How about you, what are you passionate about?"

Why can’t we - with full pride and honour - admit that we’re happier, more alive, more human, doing one of our hobbies or identifying ourselves according to one of our advocacies rather than that which brings income?

I earn money editing research papers but I don’t introduce myself by saying “I make money editing papers.” Not that I am not passionate about the work. In fact I advocate for people to choose something they are interested about, something not soul-crushing, when choosing work. And that’s why I edit papers. I feel good doing it. I’m skilled doing it and frankly better than many freelance editors out there. But it is not who I am. I am more than it. And even if there are instances where I need to introduce myself using the “income-generating” part of me, deep inside, I have much more exciting stuff to offer.

So when I introduce myself to most people, online or offline, I say I’m a writer, I’ve written two mini-guides and made money from them. I say I’m writing a book, I’m an author, and more inspiring recently, I’m calling myself a “quiet leader,” a change maker, a personal activist, a spiritual man, a light worker. Too many choices to choose from I can invent endless labels!

And all of these are more accurate, more attuned, to who I really am.

I fuckin’ hate the economy and capitalism for forcing this into our culture - most especially in developing countries like the Philippines where life can entirely be defined with the amount of money you get for yourself.

That leaves many of us here too unconfident to stand up for our real identities - for our more colorful selves.

Why?

Because we think and adhere to this myth: WE ARE OUR JOBS.

Bullshit that.
