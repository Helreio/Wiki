**7 Key Strategies**

**Posting Schedule.** Stick to a posting schedule on your blog and on social media platforms because it will keep you grounded and accountable to yourself and your readers.

Posting Plan (2016)

- Blog (Monday): words or photos
- Blog (Friday): roundup of happy links
- Social Media: Daily photo/s on Instagram, then link to Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr

Posting Plan (2017)

- Blog (Weekly): essay or photo roundup
- Blog (Monthly): roundup of 10 happy links

Only share words, photos, and links that are inspiring and helpful.

**Social Media.** Only use social media platforms you love. Your bandwidth for social media is limited.

**Trolls and Vampires.** If someone leaves a hateful comment on your blog, ban that person from commenting on your website/social media accounts (or delete them from your email list).

Life is short. Be surrounded by kind, compassionate, and grateful people - both online and in real life.

**Respond.** Respond to all questions and appreciate every kind comment that’s left on your blog or social media.

**Cite.** Offer proper credit, don’t steal from others, and if you see unethical posting/citations, contact the person or organization.

**Blog Breaks.** Take blog breaks. Remember that you are in this for the long haul. Don’t burn out. Taking frequent breaks is good for your creative spirit and soul.

**Health first.** By keeping self-care at the top of your priority list, you will be able to blog with joy and enthusiasm which in turn contributes to your happiness.

**The Art of Blogging**

What makes good blogging content?

- Subjective
- Edit
- Curation

Essays (500-1,500 words)

Photos (goes with her brand: tiny beautiful moments and daily adventures)

Curate “Happy Links” once a month (support other authors, writers)

You don’t have to overthink about what you are blogging about.

You don’t have to be super focused on your brand.

Feel free to veer off to another topic

You’re not a robot. You’re human.

Just be authentic and share what really makes you smile.

Curation

- Curate art/things that you obsess about
- As you go through the month, take note of things you are interested in and that your readers might be interested in
- The things that made you who you are today, that’s your research, that’s what you curate and share

Edit

- Get someone to edit your copy

How often should you blog?

- Set a schedule and stick to it
- Consistency is key
- Twice a month? Fine. Just keep the schedule.

What to share?

- Share something you’ll be comfortable to share to ANYONE.
- Be mindful and valuable.

How to subscribe?

- RSS
- email

Tammy’s secret

- Keep it simple

Marketing is simply telling people what you are offering. They can simply ignore it or research it.
