# Fail small, not big. - Gretchen Rubin

"Instead of feeling that youâ€™ve blown the day and thinking, "I'll get back on track tomorrow," try thinking of each day as a set of four quarters: morning, midday, afternoon, evening. If you blow one quarter, you get back on track for the next quarter.

Fail small, not big."
