# Strategies in writing permanent notes in your own words

Strategy 1

- Read a paragraph.
- Close the book.
- Rewrite some ideas from memory without looking at the text.

Strategy 2

- Read the text and not bother with the information within
- Just write the thoughts that come into your mind.

Strategy 3

- Write the note as if you are explaining it to your mom or friend.

Problems

- I could easily forget some piece of information while writing from memory
- I wouldn't get a lot of thoughts while reading
- I would explain what I had read without really understanding the text.

Strategy 4

- Read a full article or a few chapters in a book.
- Take very short bullet point notes as you go along (those can be hand-written or typed).
- Stew for a day or two. Think about it. Have conversations about it.
- Stewing serves distances you from the text, which prevents you from using it as a crutch. Since you won't be able to remember the exact quotes or phrasing, you will be forced to put it into your own terms.
- When you come back to it, read through your notes and select a few that you want to incorporate into a zettel.
- Write that zettel without reference to the original material. Force yourself to remember what you read, to think about it, and then to write your own version of the idea. In doing so, you may even introduce some of your own thoughts into the zettel.

Strategy 5

- Examine the quote in the context of your own thoughts on the subject.
- If you agree with it completely and you have nothing to add, quote the person directly in writing.
- If you have something to add, challenge the quote or explain it to a friend.
- Come up with something that is both you and the quote.

Strategy 6: Progressive summarization

- Be selective of highlights at first.
- Pare down even more.
- What this does is to separate the shiny new ideas from the truly deep and profound.

Strategy 7

add more to their statements based on your purpose for reading the source

Strategy 8

- Determine the type of idea:
   - Mythologem
   - Model
   - Definition
   - Hypothesis
   - Receipt
   - Evidence (historical)
   - Argument
- Process the specific idea according to the structure of its type.
   - The argument is complete if you gathered the conclusion and formulated it in your own word, gathered all the necessary (at least available) premises and, lastly, put them into the correct relationship (argument structure).

Strategy 9

I have two base questions I like to ask depending on the type of quote I captured. First, What are the main ideas? I list these ideas, which are essentially titles to Zettel notes. If I have an existing note, I determine if what I read changes what I have already written. My Zettel notes are nonlinear and flow from note to note, so if the current message is new, I'll review the thought string to determine the best place to insert it into the thread. Second, if all else fails, I ask, Why did I capture this quote? The summary following this question often turns into a surprising overview of the message itself and in my own words.

Strategy 10

One method that I ultimately turn to is using diagrams. Diagrams help me understand the internal logic of what the original writer is saying and gives me room to add my own logical take. I refer to this diagram to explain the concept. I use this method for particularly difficult concepts.

the interpreter explains the meaning and story of what the speaker is talking about which makes the interpretation much easier to understand.
