# Steve Patterson on Physicalism

The thinker who was mistaken about his understanding of the universe because of conceptual limitations has not committed a grave mistake.

Who is at serious fault is the people who cling to their beliefs even when compelling evidence is presented against it.

The framework of physicalism cannot explain conscious awareness. Our conceptual toolbox has to expand.

Nonphysical phenomena cannot be explained through physical methods observation, measuring, etc.

The experience of conscious awareness is more fundamental. It is not optional. While the experience of a physical world is.

Imagine being born blind, deaf, quadriplegic.

Why philosophers should be disabled to really understand the world

Idealism

- Everything is fundamentally mental (Buddhism)

Dualism

- Problem: How do mutually exclusive substances interact with each other?

Panpsychism

- All physical things have mental states

Neutral monism

- Dualism
- But neither substances are fundamental
- Thereâ€™s a third substance: has both properties, some way of unifying them.

Physicalism is an insufficient explanation of the world
