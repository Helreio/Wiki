# Living the Truth and Talking About it.

I want to know truth because I want to live in a way that is based on truth.

If my life is my message then the way I live reflects the truth I have uncovered.

The quest cannot be a private matter. People knowing about it is inevitable.

To truly live in integrity, I wil have to take a stand.

To take a stand for truth is to take a stand against un-truth. Knowledge informs life, informs advocacy.

But the question is, should I force my beliefs on others? No definitely not.

Primary purpose, or perhaps the only purpose, is for me to live it. But to fully live the message requires me to talk about it too.

What is the purpose?

1. To have integrity. Fully embody the message.
2. To help others who have a similar outlook of life to pursue their callings more.
3. To help strangers see why such a way of life is reasonable.
4. 2 and 3 fulfills a deeper purpose, which is a world with more people who espouse these values.

If one of the inevitable parts of the purpose is to persuade others, then the way this is to be done is an important thing to think about.

Nonviolently

People

So strike a balance between taking a strong pure stand and delivering that stand in a way that more people are more open to listen to it.
