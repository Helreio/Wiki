# Productivity structures are only useful for short-term painful, long-term gainful actions

According to [[Ali Abdaal]], we only need a [[Productivity]] structure for activities that are painful for the short-term but good in the long-term (e.g., exercising, saving money, writing, etc.)

If we do what makes us fulfilled, we donâ€™t need a productivity stucture. Productivity takes care of itself. This means that [[Experiencing a desired emotion is the point of taking action]].

To do this, Ali proposes three steps:

1. Curate your workspace to elicit the emotions you want to feel (see [[Enhance the experience of a mental state by modifying the environment]]).
2. Bring other people in.
3. Gamify your experiences.

To curate your emotion in general, pursue [[Projects that improve our emotional states]].
