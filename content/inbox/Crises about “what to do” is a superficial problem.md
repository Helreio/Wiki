# Crises about “what to do” is a superficial problem

The mental state (happiness or Ginhawa) is at the hierarchy of this model.

The activities that generate presence or flow and consequently happiness and Ginhawa come only at the third level of this hierarchy. Therefore, when we experience an existential crisis about what we want to do, that crisis is happening not in the fundamental level but in a more superficial level.

We flow through different ways; that is the subjective secondary purpose. But we all flow, and being present to flow is a more fundamental purpose than anything else; that is our primary purpose.

This thinking should inform our choice of projects. We should ask ourselves:

1. What projects can we deliberately engage in to get sucked into the present moment?

And remember, when one’s purpose is a mental state, it necessitates that we revisit it. We need to regularly manifest what we want to feel.

Also, another differentiation is thinking about purpose as two things:

1. The state we want to be in
2. What we need to do to get there.

To do
