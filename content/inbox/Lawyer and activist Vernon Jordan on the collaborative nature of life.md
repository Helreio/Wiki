# Lawyer and activist Vernon Jordan on the collaborative nature of life

Lawyer and activist Vernon Jordan on the collaborative nature of life:

“You are where you are today because you stand on somebody’s shoulders. And wherever you are heading, you cannot get there by yourself. If you stand on the shoulders of others, you have a reciprocal responsibility to live your life so that others may stand on your shoulders. It’s the quid pro quo of life. We exist temporarily through what we take, but we live forever through what we give.”
