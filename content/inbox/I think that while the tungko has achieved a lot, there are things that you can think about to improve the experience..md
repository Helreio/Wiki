# I think that while the tungko has achieved a lot, there are things that you can think about to improve the experience.

We are emphasizing the internal and the maginhawang process of writing poetry. But maginhawa doesn't always associate to healing. There is also ginhawa even when there is no wound to heal.

How about ginhawa in humor?

I don't know if talking about our dark experiences will do justice to what we are trying to achieve.

You are asking us to write poems from muddy places and releasing that into the group. But is the group intentionally created to give enough space for our poems to breath. Personally, I feel like I went through a lot to write that one poem but when I released it to the group I am not sure if my poem was really heard, honored, etc.
