# How to use the triple-column technique

To practice the [[Triple-column technique]], do the following:

1. Get a piece of paper.
2. Draw two lines down the center of the paper to divide it into thirds.
3. Label the left-hand column “Automatic Thoughts.”
4. Label the middle column “Cognitive Distortion.”
5. Label the right-hand column “Rational Response.”
6. Under the left-hand column, write down all the negative thoughts you automatically think.
7. Using the [[List of Cognitive Distortions]], identify the thinking errors present in each of your negative automatic thoughts.
8. Finally, substitute the negative automatic thought with a more rational, less upsetting thought in the right-hand column. When writing this, strive to uncover the truth. Do not write a lie just to cheer yourself up. You need to truly believe your rebuttal for it to work. If you can’t think of a rebuttal, leave it for a while then return or ask help from other people.

Here’s an example of the triple-column technique in action:

While not required, you can do an emotional accounting before and after using the triple-column technique to track it effectiveness. Before and after using it, record how upset you are between 0 and 100 percent.

A more complete elaboration of the triple-column technique is [[Aaron Beck]]'s [[Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts]].
