# The behavior of the virus does nor rely in our behavior

(1) predictions of doom based on people's so-called "bad behavior" often turn out to be embarrassingly off the mark, and (2) the "moralistic fable" behind COVID (whereby good and virtuous behavior makes the numbers go down and "reckless" behavior does the opposite) is unhelpful.

"The fable we tell ourselves," writes Leonhardt, "is that our day-to-day behavior dictates the course of the pandemic. When we are good — by staying socially distant and wearing our masks — cases are supposed to fall. When we are bad — by eating in restaurants, hanging out with friends and going to a theater or football game — cases are supposed to rise."
