# Maybe we also cannot escape morality?

If we cannot escape logic.

Maybe we also cannot escape morality?

Which only means "our reasons" for doing things.

What is the common category between moral claims and nihilism?

They are both expressions of feelings?

For me, ideas of good and bad are simply expressions of emotions.

And these emotions are always relative to an individual.

Which grows into a culture or society.

But accurately always the individual bec the individual always has his or her own version of the emotions.

In this case all prescriptive cases, including prescriptions from economic theories are relative and subjective.
