# It is better to argue from what we are more certain of

Steve Patterson wrote something about the sliding scale of certainty.

In our quest for truth, there are statements that are absolutely 100 percent true ([[Objective truth exists]]), but most statements cannot claim absolute certainty. Nevertheless, we use these statements in making arguments and in practical matters of daily life (see [[Fictionalism]]).

When making an argument, it is better to use ideas we are more certain of than those we are less certain of.
