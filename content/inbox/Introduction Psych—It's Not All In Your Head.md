# Introduction: Psych—It's Not All In Your Head

Mental illness is not entirely a psychological problem.

Mental illness is not purely a neurochemical problem.

Not a single study has proven that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.

Depression is merely a symptom.

Depression is a sign that something is off balance or ill in the body that needs to be remedied.

Depression is a grossly misdiagnosed and mistreated condition today.

Mental illnesses and related symptoms are caused by lifestyle factors and undiagnosed physiological conditions that develop far from the brain, such as the gut and thyroid.

A chemical pill cannot cure mental illness.

Antidepressants can irreversibly disable the body’s natural healing mechanisms.

Antidepressants can worsen the course of mental illness.

Antidepressants can also cause:

- liver damage
- abnormal bleeding
- weight gain
- sexual dysfunction
- reduced cognitive function

Antidepressants are among the most difficult drugs to taper.

Kelly Brogan’s procedure

1. Discuss medical and personal history (questions about life’s exposures since birth, noxious chemical encounters, being born through the birth canal, breast-fed, etc.)
2. Orders lab tests to know the patient's total biology.
3. Discovers what is unfolding in the patient’s life today (impairment of immune system, current lifestyle, sugar consumption, dietary habits, gut and microbial communities collaboration, hormone levels such as thyroid and cortisol, genetic variants in DNA that can puts one at a higher risk for depression, beliefs about health, intentions on working together).

Kelly Brogan’s strategies

- Dietary modifications (more healthy fats and less sugar, dairy, and gluten)
- Natural supplements like B vitamins and probiotics that don’t require prescription and can even be delivered through certain foods
- Minimizing exposures to biology-disrupting toxicants (fluoride in taw and fragrances in cosmetics)
- Sleep and physical movement
- Behavioral techniques that promote the relaxation response

Kelly Brogan’s questions

- Why have the body and mind become dysfunctional in so many millions of people?
- Are we inherently broken?
- Why have we gotten so much sicker in the past century when our DNA—the same DNA we’ve had for millions of years—hasn’t changed?
- Are doctors just getting better at labeling symptoms under the wastebasket diagnosis that is depression?

Chapter 1: Decoding Depression

The only path to a real solution is to leave the medical world you know behind.

The journey is not about symptom suppression, it’s about health freedom.

The truth about prescription-based care is that we’ve been duped.

The Western Medical Illusion

- We are broken.
- Fear is an appropriate response to symptoms.
- We need chemicals to feel better.
- Doctors know what they are doing.
- The body is a machine requiring calibration (via drugs). A little too much of this, too little of that.

Shed the fear, take back your inner compass, and embrace a commitment to your best self, medication free.

Embrace these new ideas

- Prevention is possible.
- Medication treatment comes at a steep cost.
- Optimal health is not possible through medication.
- Your health is under your control.
- Working with lifestyle medicine—simple everyday habits that don’t entail drugs—is a safe and effective way to send the body a signal of safety.
1. Map out the timeline that brought you here.
2. Identify triggers that often fall under one or more of the following categories: food intolerances or sensitivities, blood sugar imbalances, chemical exposures, thyroid dysfunction, and nutrient deficiency.
3. Make simple shifts in your daily habits, starting with diet.
4. Increase nutrient density.
5. Eliminate inflammatory foods.
6. Balance blood sugar.
7. Bring yourself closer to food in its ancestral state.

Food is information.

To achieve radical wellness

- Send the body the right information
- Protect it from aggressive assault

Mental health is a manifestation of all that your body is experiencing and your mind’s interpretation of its own safety and power.

Symptoms are just the visible rough edges of a gigantic submerged iceberg.

In holistic medicine, there are no specialties. It’s all connected.

Never return to a lifestyle that involves pharmaceutical products of any kind, under any circumstances.

- The body is an intricately woven spiderweb, when you yank one area of it, the whole thing moves.
- There is a more powerful way to heal.

To be healthy in today’s world, you need to access and cultivate a reliance on yourself.

- Shift your perspective forever by understanding the truth about medicine.

Drug-based medicine makes you sick.

Hospital care makes you sick.

Prescription drugs are the third leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer.

When you visit a doctor or hospital, you have only a 36 percent chance that you’ll receive a treatment that has been scientifically proven to be either beneficial or likely to be beneficial.

Why pharmaceutical products won’t work

- Predicated on wrong-headed information
- Have not been developed or studied with modern science’s most relevant principles in mind
- Operates under the antiquated one gene, one illness, one pill rubric

Responding with fear leads us to make decisions that are myopic.

When you have a symptom don’t be afraid. Instead, bring some wonder to it. Ask why and try to make the connections.

“Everything you’ve ever wanted is on the other side of fear.”

Develop critical thinking about what you buy, the medical advice you take, and what the media tells you.

**Depression is not a disease**

Psychiatry is based on a highly subjective diagnostic system.

Psychiatry has a long history of abusing patients.

Psychotropic drugs are as harmful and absurd.

Psychiatry is the wastebasket for the shortcomings of conventional medicine (i.e. psychosomatic illnesses).

Auto intoxication

- Connection between toxic conditions in the gut and mood and brain function.
- The gut was regarded as the seat of health in ancient medical practices for centuries
- 1900s, studies began
- 1950s, studies declined
- 1950s-, pharmaceutical industry took off, gut and brain connection declined

Higher levels of inflammatory markers, which often indicate that the body’s immune system is on high alert, significantly increase the risk of developing depression.

Higher levels of inflammatory markers equates with more severe depression.

Depression is an inflammatory disorder like heart disease, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, cancer, and dementia.

What really causes depression?

- Impact of sedentary lifestyles, processed food diets, and unrelenting stress.
- Western diet which contributes to higher levels of inflammation.
- High blood sugar
- Diabetes and depression might not be distinct conditions
- Smoking
- Altered gut function
- Allergies
- Dental cavities
- Sleep deficiency
- Vitamin D deficiency

Psychoneuroimmunology

- Examining (and respecting) the complex interplay between various systems and organs of the body, especially those that syncopate the nervous, gastrointestinal, and immune systems in a brilliant dance that in turn affects mental well-being.
- Personalized lifestyle medicine that accounts for the role of the environment in triggering inflammation and the manipulation of the immune and endocrine systems is the most sensible way to approach those individuals who would otherwise be candidates for multiple medications. It turns out that it may not all be in your head—but rather in the interconnectedness among the gut, immune, and endocrine systems.
- Gut-based immune system is the body and mind’s center of gravity.

What then is depression?

- A symptom that does not tell you anything about its root cause.
- An adaptive response, intelligently communicated by the body, to something not being right within, often because things are also off in our environment.
- Depression doesn’t always manifest with feelings of serious melancholy and sadness.
- Depression manifests as anxiety - an inner kinetic discomfort, restlessness, unease, and a lot of insomnia.

The system creates patients who are otherwise healthy and just need to recalibrate their bodies using simple lifestyle interventions, mostly around diet—not drugs.

**An evolutionary mismatch**

Evolution is slow.

Our caveman days are still very much part of our DNA.

Depression is simply a sign of an evolutionary mismatch.

We are engaged in lifestyles that are not compatible with what our genome has evolved over millions of years to expect.

2 revolutions that changed us

1. Neolithic (or agricultural) Revolution
2. Industrial Revolution

For 99% of our existence we followed the Paleolithic diet devoid of inflammatory and insulinotropic foods (sugar, grain, and dairy).

Our body’s microbial ecology (90% of our cells that are non-human in nature), has been a primary victim. And it has impacted the expression of our genes.

Microbiome

- 100 trillion microbes in intestines
- Outnumber your own cells (1 is to 10)
- Covers insides and outsides
- Contain 8 million genes of their own
- 99% of the genetic material in your body is not your own.
- Microbes influence the expression our DNA
- Microbial DNA has become part of our own DNA to help us evolve and flourish
- Live in your digestive tract
- Includes fungi, parasites, and viruses. But bacteria is king.
- We are a meta-organism, we cannot live without our microbiome.
- Your microbiome influences practically everything about your health, including how you feel both emotionally, physically, and mentally.

Microbiome enemies

1. Exposure to substances that kill or negatively change the composition of the bacterial colonies (environmental chemicals, antibiotics, artificial sugars, processed gluten-containing foods)
2. Lack of nutrients that support healthy, diverse tribes of good microbes
3. Unrelenting stress

We have coevolved with these microorganisms throughout our journey on this planet, and we must respect them for what they are: the body’s—and brain’s—best friend. And they are as much a part of our survival and mental well-being as our own cells are.
