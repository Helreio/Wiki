# Writing about the outer world reinforces the inner world

Craig Mod has a personal development routine for sure. And he sometimes writes about these. But on top of these, he writes about his experiences in the outside world. He is like Pico Iyer - a writer about both the inner and outer world. Writing about the outer world reinforces the inner world - revisiting is savoring experiences. Writing about experiences also motivates one to pursue more of these experiences, which improves one's inner world more.
