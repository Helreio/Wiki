# There are a lot of things we don't know "directly."

Media reports. How are we sure they're true?

Scientific findings. How are we sure they're accurate?

The YouTube video your mom sent you. How valid is its claims?

We don't know these things directly but we're so fast to believe them. We don't even stop to ask. A lot of the things we believe in and even fight for nowadays are things we acquired through blind faith.
