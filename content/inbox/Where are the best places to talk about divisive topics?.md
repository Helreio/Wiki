# Where are the best places to talk about divisive topics?

Not social media.

1. In a public platform where people expect to read posts about such topics and engage.
2. In one-on-one scenarios where a person asks another about their position and allow them to explain it in an honest process.
3. In a brave circle of friends who do care about you.
