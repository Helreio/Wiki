# We dont do something because it is inherently good or avoid something because it is iherently bad.

We do something because of two things

1. Our conscious rational opinion of it being effective relative to a particular goal we have in the context of a situation
2. Unconscious forces influencing our decision without knowing it

The second half of this equation we can't do anything much about.

But it is the first half of this equation that we can at least give some conscious effort on.

We define what we want.

We do something we believe could lead us to what we want.

What we want is influenced by subjective knowledge and inclinations.

Only through developing skills to understand our SELF (social, essential, and true) can we really know what we want.

After knowing what we want we need to take into consideration the situation it is in context with.

Our wants present themselves in different forms situated in specific contexts.

By developing the skill of seing things as they are can we come up with the best response to a situation where our goal is situated in.

In both exercises, mindfulness is the skill to develop
