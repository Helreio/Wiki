A phrase uttered

But never questioned

But can we channel the critical thinking energy we use to challenge the narratives of the nation into challenging our very own narratives?

Are we already 100% convinced that our dedication to the nacion is established on strong grounds?

Convinced enough that we can listen to other perspectives without being angered, perplexed, or irritated?

I think that the people who are willing to die for the nacion are smart people. What might be lacking from them is honesty, humility, open-mindedness.
