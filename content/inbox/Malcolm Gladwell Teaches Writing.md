# Structuring Narrative: The Imperfect Puzzle

Writing is making pieces fit.

## Don't complete the puzzle

The best arguments are imperfect. The perfect argument is too obvious.

The imperfection draws interest.

People are drawn more to imperfect things.

What is interesting?

## Make promises you don't keep

Being neat and tidy is not the goal of a narrative. It’s okay to be messy.

Being interesting is a more important goal than being complete.

## Case Study: Juvenile Delinquents

We remember the story because it is incomplete.

## Case Study: Howard Moskowitz

To do: Write a piece where you break a promise.

## Number Sections to Connect Disparate Pieces

You can solve the problem of transitions just by numbering sections.

When you’re doing talking about something, just end the section then start a new section. You don’t need proper transition.

# Holding Readers: Tools for Engagement

Craft a general theory to explain your story.

The desire to use the tool keeps a reader going.

## Create a connection to data

People need a reason to look at numbers.

Only show a chart or graph after you’ve told a story that sets why it is meaningful.

Break up a graph in different ways.

## Give the reader some candy

There’s a difference between the meal and the treat.

There are things in a piece that is easy to remember, to express to others. These are the candies.

There are things in a piece that are not easy to express, they are what we think about. These are are the meal.

Your goal as a writer is to give your reader something to think about and something to talk about and those two may not be the same.

## Examples of candy

Biographical trivias: (by the way, ________ is the son of _________) etc.

Funny jokes in footnotes

# Holding Readers: Controlling Information

## Cultivate surprise

Telling a story is a risk. I’m telling it without knowing how you’ll react.

Conversations happen because we’re risk-takers.

Create an environment where stories can be told

Do an honest examination of what you really know.

Be surprised if you know something new.

The more you know about something, the better you become at being surprised, because you get better at identifying what you didn’t know before.

## Invite readers to guess

Challenge their expectations. Do not just affirm what they already believe.

## Invite readers to identify themselves

## Withold information with a purpose

As a writer, you have to create struggle, a reason for a reader to continue reading. To do that, withold information.

You can withold bits and pieces. Not necessarily the main argument.

## Play suspense and surprise

Suspense is a function of time.

You should’ve been told about it but not yet.

Withhold information from readers to create suspense.

Surprise vs suspense

- Surprise is when I tell you something and you had no idea it was coming or you need to know it.
- Suspense is when you know that you need to know something but you haven’t been told.

A good writer will do both games.

# Research

## Get off the internet

If I am looking for an story I don’t want a dead end.

The biggest work for the writer is to decide where he wants to go. And in that work, the computer is not your friend.

## Go to the library

If you like a book, what books are around it?

## Follow the footnotes

Footnotes show you how the author thinks.

The better stuff are the older stuff.

## Follow your curiosity

Don’t gather something just to use for today. Gather something even if you don’t know if it will be useful now.

## Find stories that speak for themselves

# Selecting the story

All great stories have an ending that transports you somewhere. If what the writing did was to bring you back to where you came from at the beginning, then it was a waste of time.

## Look where you've looked before

If you find an interesting person, it means they are part of an interesting group. Remember that when you are looking for story ideas.

The best place to find good story ideas is the same place you found good story ideas in the past.

Use the principle of connectedness to find more good ideas.

## Expand on the ctitical details

When responding to someone, instead of being interested in their words, be interested in where their words come from.

## Avoid the first-person problem

If you write in the first person, the bar is higher, because the reader has higher expectations.

Readers are educated on stories of great people.

When you write about yourself, you are engaging in a self-indulgent act, which means you are dealing with the contents of your own heart and mind. This raises people’s suspicions—who is this person who thinks that they’re so interesting that I have to read what has gone on in their life?

# Developing the Story

## Test the idea itself

The act of telling an idea is a good way to practice telling a story.

Tell it over and over again to different people. Every time you tell it to someone, look to see if they find it interesting or not. If they don’t find it interesting, why? When do they show disinterest?

People are more honest in their feedback if you tell the story to them in person than when you have them read a draft.

You can tell the idea several times to the same person in different forms until you find the form that they seem to like.

Things you find interesting and things your audience find interesting overlap but not perfectly.

## Grow the idea

Listen to people talk. Engage in conversations. Tell you story and then ask them what it reminds them of.

“Everyone is necessarily the hero of their imagination.” - Franz Kafka

## Experience the story

# Developing the Story: Analogous Worlds

## Hunt for patterns

Patterns are things that happen in different worlds simultaneously.

You see patterns so long as you inhabit different worlds.

Regularly leave your mind, and visit other people’s minds. Leave your field, and go to a different field.

## Case study: David and Goliath

Frame stories in a way that is simply and quickly communicates ideas.

A story can live in a variety of different worlds. Don’t think that a story lives in just one world and you need to stay in that world. That’s a boring way to miss truths.

## Case study: What the Dog Saw

Take something trivial, get to a different world to add weight to that trivial thing.

Never settle in the world you were given. Get out of that world to understand it better.

Ask yourself: Is there an analogous world that has dealt with the same question?

# Interviewing

## Find your subject's authentic self

Malcolm is an interviewer who wants to draw his interviewee’s best self

## Show your subjects why they're interesting

The job of the writer is not to supply the ideas but to be patient enough to find the ideas in any encounter.

Just learn where to look, how to listen, and how to push people in the right direction.

Listen and appreciate what the person is saying. Bring your naive self and let it react to what you are hearing.

It’s important to be naive. It’s not a failure.

## Make your subjects slow down

Your reader is closer to you than the person you are interviewing. Because your question could be similar to the question of your reader.

You’re representing your audience during an interview.

If you don’t understand something, let them stop. If you find something fascinating, tell it to them.

Use the word “Wait,” a lot. It slows down your subjects. Slowing down gives you time to think, to go back to something they may have skipped but is interesting, and it gives you a better shot at understanding what you are saying.

## Use humility as a tactic

Humble questions are more interesting.

Humility allows you to navigate the world easier.

Interviews don’t work when interviewers are so anxious about inserting themselves into the conversation, that they derail it.

Good interviews start from a position of humility: For the purposes of this interview, I am more interested in you than in me. This is a tactic.

- In real life, I might be more interesting than you, but in this interview I will do everything to make you interesting.

## Make interviews short and unscripted

To listen intently for more than two hours is too much.

Running an interview when you’re tired is a waste of time.

If you are writing questions before an interview, you are assuming things. Avoid assuming.

Hunt for the unexpected things. When you prepare questions you are closing doors to these unexpected things.

# Characters: Descriptions

## Summon a character's spirit

See his description of Nicholas Taleb

## Use other people to describe a character

See his description of Nicholas Taleb’s employees

## Establish character quickly

See his description of Edward Temin, Nobel Prize winner on striptase

# Characters: World Building

## Describing Your Character's World

When you describe someone else’s space, you can describe the personality of a person.

## Practice: Building a Character

Think like an athlete: Practice. Spend more time practicing writing.

Practice writing about one’s space. Go to a friend’s bedroom. How well can you summon this person just by describing their space?

## Write About Someone Through Other People's Eyes

Never talk to the person.

Talk to the people around him and write a profile using that.

After that, show it to your absent subject.

Then compare that profile to the profile you create from what the person themself describe themself.

Then askt them which do they prefer.
