# Use if or lose it

Our brains are efficient machines, and they rapidly discard information that doesn't seem useful. The brain's "use it or lose it" policy applies to everything we learn.

In fact, studies show we forget about 75% of material learnt within a 48 hour period.

The solution is simple, however: *review*. By reviewing newly-learnt information, we can greatly reduce forgetting.
