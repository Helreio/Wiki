# Mandatory vaccination creates an inferior class

Mandatory vaccination has constitutional, ethical, moral, and legal problems. Consent on vaccination must be given voluntarily in the absence of undue pressure, coercion, or manipulation.

A reporter from SkyNews Australia, made the following brilliant statement articulating the dangers of mandatory vaccination:

“Once you start down this path of dividing any society into two distinct classes of people, you have abandoned liberty and democracy and replaced it with tyranny, fear, and suspicion. Worse, and this is what really disturbs me, once the authorities that there are now two classes of Australian—the good and the bad—and that one class is superior to another and get special privileges, while the other class is shunned, locked out, vilified, and loses their employment, you have by definition created an inferior class, for which the Germans once coined as a simple word, which roughly translates “under” or “inferior”—Untermensch. If that word rings a chill of horror into your heart, so it should.”
