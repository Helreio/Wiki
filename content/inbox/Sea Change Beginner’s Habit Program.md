# Sea Change Beginner’s Habit Program

# *Beginner’s Habit Program*

Many people, including new members of this Sea Change Program, make the common mistake of attempting difficult habits before they have basic habit skills.

Imagine attempting to build a house before learning how to hammer a nail, saw a board, or lay concrete. The house wouldn’t turn out too well. The same applies to habits: taking on difficult habits (like procrastination, healthy eating, exercise), or doing advanced skills like multiple habits at once or changing thinking habits (negative thinking) or quitting a tough bad habit like smoking … is a recipe for a house that will collapse.

So what’s a better way? Start by learning the basic habit skills.

That’s what this Beginner’s Habit Program is for. It’s a month-long mini-course designed to teach you how to create habits without having to tackle anything too hard. We’ll take on a very easy habit at first, just to learn the basics.

Now, I realize that it will seem too easy to most people … and so most people will skip it. That’s probably a mistake. You might still be able to create harder habits, but you will likely have a much harder time, and future habits that you try to create will also probably be harder.

Who should do this beginner program?

**Skip the program** if you:

- Have successfully created a habit in the last two months;
- Or have successfully created several habits in the last year;
- And, if you’ve done either of those, you feel you understand how habits work.

**You should do the program** if you:

- Have failed one or more of habits in the last few months;
- Or seem to struggle with habits in general.

I realize that some of you might fall in both categories, or neither … in that case you’d have to make a judgment call. Do you feel you have a decent grasp on the basics of habit formation? If your gut says no, do this Beginner’s Habit Program.

### When & How Often to Do This Program

I recommend that anyone who signs up for Sea Change do this program first, unless you are in the “Skip the program” category above. If you’ve been in Sea Change for one or more months already but have struggled, you should probably go back to basics and do this program.

There is no shame in doing the Beginner Habit Program! It’s not a class for “failures”, but simply a smart way to learn some fundamental skills that will help you for the rest of your life.

You should do this program for a minimum of a month. However, if you still feel a bit shaky about forming habits, or if you struggled during the month and didn’t do well, you should probably repeat it a second month, and even a third. There is, again, no shame in that.

There’s also no rush — you’re not trying to form habits asap, but for life. Take your time and get it right.

### The Program

This program is very simple: you’re going to take a very easy habit, and put it into practice each day. You’ll “level up” each week. You’ll use the forum (or another social tool) for accountability. You’ll make sure you don’t forget. And in the process, you’ll learn how habits are formed — not conceptually, but in practice.

This is a really valuable thing to learn, and so no matter how silly this program seems, you should be proud of doing it, and of your progress.

**Step 1: Pick a very very easy habit**. Choose ONE of the following (or another similar habit that is just as easy):

- Drink a glass of water each day.
- Put your clothes in the hamper before/after you shower.
- Wash your dishes after breakfast.
- Eat one fruit for breakfast.
- Write down one Most Important Task when you start your workday. (You don’t have to do the task.)

**Step 2: Pick a reliable daily trigger**. A trigger is something *already* in your daily routine to which you will attach the habit. So every time the trigger happens, you’ll very consciously do the habit, immediately after the trigger. With enough conscious repetition, the habit will become mentally bonded to the trigger, so that you will need less conscious effort and reminders and accountability.

Pick a trigger you do every day of the week. Some examples: waking up, brushing teeth, eating breakfast, drinking first cup of coffee, showering, eating lunch, eating dinner, leaving for work, arriving at work, leaving work, arriving home, turning on computer, going to bed. The work ones might not be ideal because most people don’t work 7 days a week. Even if you have an irregular schedule, you probably wake up and go to bed every day, and eat at least one meal regularly, and probably brush your teeth and/or shower regularly.

**Step 3: Make a commitment**. One of the best motivators — the best way to actually do the habit and stick with it — is social accountability. To do that, pick a group of people whose opinion you care about, and make a commitment to doing this new habit every single day this coming month. Why a month? It’s a convenient amount of time, and it’s around the amount of time it takes for an easy habit to form if you’ve consistently done it every day. That’s not set in stone and depends on consistency and difficulty of habit and how much you enjoy the habit.

First pick a group — you can commit to other Sea Change members on the forum in general, or join an accountability team on the forum and commit to them. I suggest the latter, as committing to a smaller group who is actually paying attention to what you’re doing is generally better. You can also commit to friends, family members and_or co-workers via email, Facebook_Twitter, etc.

Then make a public commitment to the group. Simply tell them that you are going to do the new habit (tell them what it is) every single day for a month, and ask them to hold you accountable each day. Tell them you promise to report to them daily. You can even set consequences for success or failure if you like (that tends to work for many people).

**Step 4: Set reminders**. Have one or more reminders set around your chosen trigger — multiple reminders are a good idea. For example, if your trigger is breakfast, put paper reminders on your cereal box and the table/chair where you eat breakfast, or on your cereal bowl. Set a phone reminder to go off a little before you eat breakfast. You might also ask a family member or roommate to remind you if they are usually around at that time.

**Step 5: Focus on starting the habit each day**. Many people make the mistake of mentally picturing the entire habit. If the habit is hard, you will then be de-motivated. Instead, picture only the beginning of the habit — with this beginner habit, but also all future habits. If it’s exercise (in the future), just think about getting your shoes on and getting out the door. If it’s meditation, just get your butt on the cushion. If it’s drinking water, just get the glass out.

Each day, with the help of your reminders, focus on starting your new habit. Put all your energy into this. You can do it!

**Step 6: Report each day**. As soon as possible after doing the habit, report to the group of people you committed yourself to. Just a simple “did it!” will suffice. If you like, report on your stats as well: “Day 6 is done, I’m 6-for-6!” It’s important that you report each day, whether you failed or succeeded. Even if you fail, commit yourself even more to doing the habit the next day.

### Leveling Up

Consistency and getting a good streak going is important, so for this program, think of each week as a “level” (like in a video game). What you want to do is get 7 straight days each week. If you do, you’ve “leveled up”.

So:

1. If you do 7 straight days the first week, you’ve leveled up … you’ve gone from White Belt to Yellow Belt in the Beginner’s Habit Program. If you missed 1 or more days, you should shoot for 7 straight days in the second week so you can get to Yellow Belt.
2. If you level up and then do 7 straight days the second week, congrats! You’ve now moved from Yellow Belt to Orange Belt! If you missed a day or two, stay at Yellow Belt and shoot to advance to Orange Belt in Week 3 with 7 straight days. If you missed 3 or more days while a Yellow Belt, you’re now back to White Belt and should try to level back up to Yellow Belt with 7 straight days in the next week.
3. If you move to Orange Belt and then do 7 straight days in the next week, you are now a Blue Belt! That’s amazing. If you are Orange Belt and miss one or two days, you stay at Orange Belt. If you miss 3 or more days as an Orange Belt, you move back down to Yellow Belt.
4. If you are at Blue Belt and do 7 more straight days in the next week, you are now a Purple Belt! This means you’ve mastered the Beginner’s Habit Program. If you missed a day or two as a Blue Belt, you stay at Blue Belt. If you missed 3 or more days as Blue Belt, you move back down to Orange Belt.

If you get through the month and reach Purple Belt, you should definitely move on to a harder habit and do the current habit module with us the next month.

If you reach Blue Belt by the end of the month, you’re pretty decent and can also move on to the current module next month if you want, or try a new easy habit and repeat the program in the following month. Go by feel.

If you get to White, Yellow or Orange Belt, you should do the program again … but start the next round at the belt you reached! Then you can easily reach Purple Belt by the end of the 2nd month.

# *How Habits Are Formed*

How are habits formed? This is the key to making any of the changes we make in the Sea Change Program, and this method is embedded in the monthly plan for each module.

Habits are formed when actions are tied to a trigger by consistent repetition so that when the trigger happens, you have an automatic urge to do the action.

Some examples:

- When you wake up (trigger), you start the coffee machine (habit).
- When you get to work (trigger), you check your email (habit).
- When you get stressed (trigger), you eat junk food (habit).

Our lives are filled with these trigger-habit combos, often without our being aware of them. If you drive home from work every weekday following the same route, you probably often drive by rote, making turns without thinking about it, because of constant repetition.

How did these habits form?

1. Through consistent repetition over the years.
2. They started with actions performed very consciously at first, before they were a habit, and gradually they became more automatic and less conscious.
3. There is a feedback loop that helped us repeat the habit for a good length of time. For example, if you are stressed and then eat junk food, you might get pleasure or comfort (positive feedback), and if you don’t eat the junk food, you remain stressed (negative feedback). So positive feedback for indulging an urge and negative feedback for not indulging it makes to want to do it repeatedly, whenever the trigger happens, which leads to the formation of a habit.

The opposite feedback loop exists for many things, including exercise and eating healthy:

- If you dislike exercise or are out of shape, then when you exercise it is painful or unpleasant (negative feedback) and much more comfortable if you don’t exercise (positive feedback).
- If you dislike healthy food, then when you eat healthy food you think it’s boring, bland, or unpleasant (negative feedback), and when you eat unhealthy food, you enjoy yourself more (positive feedback).

And so feedback is normally set up so that you are unlikely to stick with these habits for long enough to actually make them automatic habits. Feedback is instead set up so that many bad habits (eating unhealthy food, being sedentary, doing drugs, surfing the Internet constantly) will be repeated often enough to become habits.

Fortunately, we can reverse the feedback loop by engineering our habit environment:

1. **Create positive feedback for habits you want to form**. Good ways to do that are to start with habits you enjoy and focus on the enjoyment of those habits, create social accountability by telling your friends that you acted on the good habit, and rewarding yourself.
2. **Create negative feedback for not doing the habit**. Social accountability is a good way to do this — tell your friends you’re going to act on this new habit for 30 days, and for each day you don’t, there will be a negative consequence.
3. **Reduce negative feedback for doing the habit**. Don’t expect to form habits you persistently dislike — find healthy foods and exercise that you enjoy. Only do the activity you want to make a habit for 3-5 minutes at first — so it’s easy and not something you dread.
4. **Reduce positive feedback for not doing the habit**. If you sit on your butt and don’t exercise, don’t allow yourself to do other pleasurable things. Create negative consequences. Make people get on your case and take away your wireless router and cable TV box, for example.

### The Sea Change Habit Method

**1. Pick only ONE small, positive habit** — A 5-10 minute limit to start with. You will expand it later, but start as small as possible. This is extremely important, because most people make the mistake of doing multiple habits, or trying to do too much with the habit they’re forming, or both.

**2. Come up with a plan**. Take 1 week to pick your specific habit (start as small as possible), analyze your behaviors, pick a trigger, plan out how you’ll overcome your obstacles, pick the time of day you’ll implement the habit, plan who your support network will be, create a log for the habit, pick rewards, and decide what your motivations are. Write these down!

**3. Do the habit immediately after the trigger for 4-6 weeks**. Build in reminders. Try never to skip it. The more consistent you are, the stronger the habit will be. [Read more about triggers](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/triggers-and-habits/).

**4. Build in positive feedback**. Focus on enjoyment, make it a game, create competition, do it with a partner or group if possible. Some good ways to build in positive feedback:

- Enjoy the habit. This is the best way. If you form a daily habit of having tea, focus on the full enjoyment of that tea as you do the new habit. This is built-in positive feedback, and you’ll look forward to the new habit if you focus on enjoyment.
- Announce your success after the habit. After you go for your walk (a new habit), post about it on Facebook, Twitter, and your blog. People congratulate you. You feel great.
- Do something enjoyable right after the habit. If you like to check email, but want to write for 10 minutes a day, check email right after you write for 10 minutes (but not before).

[Read more about habit motivations](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/habit-motivations/).

**5. Report daily to a social group** (blog, Twitter, Facebook, email, or friends at work), use them for support when things get difficult. When you feel like not doing the habit, have one or more people you can call on for help. A social group is built-in positive feedback, as well as motivation through accountability. A few notes:

- Find a group you care about. This might be your friends on Facebook or Twitter. It might be your blog readers. You might have friends, family, or colleagues you can email. It might be an online forum you’re a part of.
- If you don’t have such a group, join an appropriate forum online and get to know the people there. There are tons of forums — find one that relates to your habit change. Read the rules of the forum, introduce yourself. Post questions, tell people about your new habit. Pledge to report to them daily.
- Every single time you do the habit, report to the group immediately after. When you’re done with your 10-minute run, for example, get into the house, drink a glass of water, and then go to your computer and report it. Or tell your wife and kids if that’s your accountability group.
- If you don’t do the habit for some reason, still report it. Commit to reporting either way, no matter what. It will greatly increase your odds of success.

**6. Test, adjust, iterate immediately**. When you start a habit change, you are testing an approach, and it is very possible it will fail. That’s fine. Knowing that your initial approach didn’t work is good information, and you should use it to adjust your approach, and retry as soon as possible.

# *Habit Motivations*

What are your motivations for doing your new habit? This is an important question, because many people don’t think through the motivation issue and then blame their lack of discipline when they don’t stick to a habit.

But it’s not discipline that keeps you doing a habit–it’s motivation.

If you think you’re not disciplined, you just need to figure out a better motivation solution.

### Positive/Negative Feedback Loops

One of the most important concepts I’ve learned about habits is that they’re shaped by positive and negative feedback. If the feedback loops are set up to steer you toward doing the habit you are *much more likely* to stick to it, and if the feedback loops steer you toward *not* doing the habit, then you’ll most likely not stick to it.

Two examples:

1. **You eat candy** (or chips or soda or take drugs), and get pleasure from doing this activity (positive feedback). Not doing the activity gives you some withdrawal pains and cravings (negative feedback). So the feedback loops are set up so that you will do the activity or habit repeatedly, and the repetition forms a habit.
2. **You hate running** and it’s painful when you run (negative feedback). Not running allows you to relax (positive feedback). So the feedback loops are set up so that you won’t do the habit enough times for it to really become a habit.

You can see why unhealthy habits like junk food and being sedentary form so easily, and why healthier habits that people don’t like so much, like exercise and eating healthy food, are much harder to form. Our human nature is against them!

But not to fear: We can re-engineer the feedback cycles so that the habit is much more likely to form.

### Adding Positive Motivation

If you normally don’t like to exercise or eat healthy, here are some ways to add positive feedback (or positive motivation):

1. Find things about the habit activity that you can enjoy–the pleasure of moving or exerting yourself, the sweetness of squash, the tanginess of hummus.
2. Exercise with someone you like, such as your spouse or a good friend or co-worker, and have a conversation as you walk, jog, or workout.
3. Do your exercise in a lovely setting, which is a reward in itself.
4. Find healthy recipes you enjoy, and enjoy the hell out of them.
5. Find pleasure in learning how to cook healthy food, in the tactile joys of putting your hands on raw veggies.
6. Play sports, where the workout is a game.
7. Allow yourself to tweet or post to Facebook after a run or healthy meal–bragging is a reward!
8. Mark a red checkmark on your calendar each day you eat healthy or exercise.
9. Give yourself a nice healthy reward right after the workout.
10. Drink tea in a slow, calming manner after a workout or healthy meal.

There are lots of other ways, but you get the idea. Making the workout or healthy meal a reward in itself is a great way to build positive motivation.

### Adding Negative Motivation

While the term “negative motivation” might seem like a bad thing, actually it’s just taking advantage of the positive/negative feedback loop that’s built into us as humans. We can set this system up so that it works for our healthy habits.

Here are some ways to make it painful *not* to do a healthy habit:

1. Tell everyone you’re going to do the habit for a week–the fear of shaming yourself if you don’t do it will steer you toward doing it.
2. Make a promise on Facebook or your blog that you’ll donate to a cause you hate if you don’t do the habit every day for a week.
3. Give your spouse or friend your wireless router, and tell them you can’t use it unless you do the workout.
4. Get rid of all unhealthy food in your house, so that you’ll have to go out of the house to get anything (inconvenience).

You get the picture. Some creativity in coming up with ways to make not doing it more painful can go a long way.

# *Triggers and Habits*

Triggers are a little-known key to forming a new habit (or breaking an old one).

A trigger is an event that will kick off that automatic urge to do a habit. For example, smokers have a number of triggers — when they drink alcohol or coffee, many smokers will want to smoke.

But this works for positive habits as well. Waking up can trigger habits such as drinking coffee, brushing your teeth, going running, or anything you want.

**Habits become automatic after we’ve created a bond between the trigger and the habit — the stronger the bond, the more ingrained the habit.**

Triggers and automatic habits are how we’re able to drive home sometimes without even thinking about what we’re doing — the drive home has a series of triggers (a stoplight, a turn after a store, etc.) that cause us to do certain actions out of habit — turning, slowing down, etc. We want to put our new habits on autopilot, right after a trigger.

And if we have bad habits, we want to take them off autopilot and disassociate them from their triggers. We need to list every trigger for the bad habit, and then come up with a new positive habit for each trigger.

For example, when I quit smoking, one of my triggers was to smoke after meetings — instead, I went to my computer and typed up my notes for the meeting and sent out any necessary emails. Another trigger was stress — so instead of smoking when I got stressed, I did deep breathing and exercise. These are just examples, but you can think of your own positive habits to go with each trigger for your bad habit.

What you want to do is create a strong bond between the trigger and the new habit. So each time the trigger happens, you need to consciously perform the new habit. It has to be very conscious and deliberate at first, but over time this gets easier, and the new habit becomes almost automatic. Do it as consistently as possible, every time the trigger happens. The less consistent you are, the weaker the bond between trigger and habit. The more consistent, the stronger the bond.

### How to Choose a Trigger

Think about the habit you want to create and when you want to do it.

You need to find a trigger that’s already ingrained in your daily routine. Something you do every day, at about the same time, without fail.

Some examples of triggers you might already have:

- Waking up
- Brushing your teeth
- Showering
- Eating breakfast
- Reading your morning paper/checking email in the morning
- Commuting to work
- Coming into the office in the morning
- Eating lunch
- Commuting home
- Arriving home
- A morning meeting
- Taking the kids to school

There might be many other examples, but find one that happens when you want to do the habit, and happens regularly.

### Doing the Habit Daily

Every single day, commit to doing your new habit right after the trigger. Immediately — with no delay. You’ll need to do this very consciously at first. You might want to post a reminder for yourself where you won’t forget it.

**When you do the trigger, do the habit without fail**.

# *Setting Up Your New Habit*

So the month is starting and you’re ready to start your new habit (whether that’s the current module or some other habit) … let’s get you set up for maximum chances of success.

One thing I’ve learned through years of habit changes is that when people fail, it’s most often because they didn’t prepare and didn’t do the things that help them succeed.

What kinds of things lead to failure? Just starting the habit and expecting to remember and do it without fail. Missing a day and not doing anything to ensure that doesn’t happen again. Putting temptations in front of you if you’re trying to break an old habit. Not getting support from the people around you.

These things very often lead to failure. Let’s look at some ways to set yourself up for success:

1. **Really commit to the habit**. Most people just half-commit to the habit and expect that’s going to work, and wonder why they can’t make a habit stick. You have to fully commit. That means write the habit down. Make a written plan — what’s your trigger, what’s your accountability, what’s your motivation, how will you remember. Tell as many people as possible about it, and (this is important) ask them to hold you accountable.
2. **Set calendar & physical reminders so you’ll remember to do the habit**. In the beginning, remembering is one of the hardest things. I like sticky notes for physical reminders. For meditation, if you use a meditation cushion, put it in your bedroom doorway or some other place you won’t forget. Put something on top of your cellphone or laptop so you won’t miss it.
3. **Mentally change your identity**. Tell yourself, “I don’t eat sugar” or “I choose and work on my Most Important Task every morning” or “I meditate daily”. It’s now who you are, not something you’re going to try to do.
4. **Create your accountability system**.
5. **Set up your environment**. If you’re trying not to eat sugar, get rid of all the sugar in your house. If you’re trying not to procrastinate, close your browser and turn off your cellphone before working on an important task. Talk to your significant other and friends about supporting you. Find healthy snacks to meet the sweet craving. Do whatever you can to create an environment that’s set up for your success — most environments are not, but you can change that.
6. **Build trust in yourself**. Past experiences might have taught you that you are going to have a hard time with habit changes, but actually they were the result of a method that didn’t work — you can change the method. And prove to yourself, one small step of the time, that you are trustworthy and capable of doing this.

Hope that was helpful — these are tips I’ve found to work, and I highly encourage you to take them today.

# *The Habit Sprint*

I’m going to introduce you to a new habit idea that I’ve been testing out: the Habit Sprint.

What is it? It’s a set duration (I suggest 1 week) where you plan your habit, execute it, then review how you did and what got in your way, then improve your process for the next Habit Sprint. And repeat.

It’s based on the [Scrum process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29) for software development and other types of team projects. The idea is to constantly improve your method, and to work focused and hard for short stints (1 week).

The old method is to try to do a habit for a month, and then try another habit the next month, etc. And while that works very well, the Habit Sprint is designed to improve your habit process during that month.

### The Habit Sprint method

So here’s how it works:

1. **Plan**: Write down your plan for your habit for the next week. One habit only. When will you do it, what will your trigger be, how long will you do it, where and with whom and with what, how will you remember, what kind of accountability will you have? I suggest doing this on Monday morning, or Sunday evening.
2. **Execute**: Keep your focus on this habit for the entire week. Keep a record of how you’re doing, and any impediments/problems (a log, journal, reporting on the accountability forums, etc.).
3. **Review**: At the end of the week (say, on Sunday), do a review of your Habit Sprint. Ask yourself three questions: Did you do everything as planned? What impediments were there? What can you do to remove the impediments next time & improve the process?
4. **Improve**: Write down what you’re going to do differently, how to remove the impediments, what the new process is going to be. Then use this new process in your next Habit Sprint, in your Planning step.

And repeat each week.

So here’s what happens: you are focused each week. You see how your process works in the real world, and get instant results. And you continually improve, until by the end of four Habit Sprints (nearly a month), you’ve improved greatly.

This works really well, if you follow the plan. Give it a try, but fully commit to it!
