# I am a writer with a strong research foundation

Instead of pure academic writing, I practice [[Creative nonfiction]] and [[thoughts/i write personal essays]].

I want to sharpen my thinking ([[thoughts/understanding]]), but I also want to deliver my ideas ([[Sharing]]) in a beautiful way, where my own story—my thought processes—are strongly embedded.

Contributing to knowledge is not my ultimate goal. I don’t want to be a researcher like [[Niklas Luhmann]] or [[Andy Matuschak]]. I want to use their tools but in an entirely different context.

I actually am already doing what I want to do. I just have to stick to it and support it through better systems, like the [[Talahardin]].
