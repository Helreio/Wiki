Title: How to Make a Sacred Practice More Sacred?

Give it away...for free.

Or perhaps even better, give it in the spirit of the “gift” - where the person receiving gives back what he or she is moved to give.

Putting an “exact price” on a sacred practice (or anything, actually) has a powerful effect on the human relationship where the sacred practice is exchanged. And the very act of “measuring” the “worth” of a practice defies its very nature - it is something that will never be measured, in its deepest essence! When you measure something, you measure it “against” another thing - like money - and once it is measured against another thing, it becomes either subordinate or dominant than another (example: 400 yoga session is more valuable than a 100 zen meditation session). A thing

Giving a sacred practice as a gift also instills trust on the practitioner...trust that the Universe will provide, will let the gift flow back when it is needed...trust on the power of generosity that is human nature

A sacred practice is a gift at its very essence. As all nature is gift.

My not so secret dream is that all practitioners of sacred arts shift (even slowly) towards a gift model - to treat their practices as what they really are, gifts, and let other people see them as they really are - gifts
