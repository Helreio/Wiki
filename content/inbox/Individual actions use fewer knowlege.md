# Individual actions use fewer knowlege

When you throw a dart, you know that your [[thoughts/intention]] is to hit the bull's eye and your [[Means]] to satisfy that intention is to throw the dart towards the direction of the target because that is what you know about how people play the game. Based from that knowledge, you also know that you failed if you didn’t hit the bull’s eye.

It’s easier to remember knowledge you need to do individual actions.

This only starts to get complicted because [[Humans tend to set intentions that require multiple actions to satisfy]]
