# The Kuwan, The Agamang

We went to the market this morning

where my Tita Sabel, the balikbayan,

turo the things she likes to buy.

As she walked between piles of

pisi-pising and kar-karne and fish,

I struggled to communicate with her

in English, perspiring more with

what to say next than with

the heat trapped inside the market's

yero roof with no kisame.

As I carried the sup-supot and bayong,

my aunt continued her litany of things

she doesn't want in Pinasâ€”

the kadugyutan, the traffic, the maruming tubig,

and the dilawans.

As I listened to her California accent,

I started to feel that my Tagalog and

Pangasinan are slowly slipping away.

When we got up and rode the jeep,

I said to the passenger next to me,

"Pwede po bang pa-dere a little bit?"

and when I asked the passenger next to her

to pass our fare, I said,

"Paki-derew nga po to the driver. Thanks!"

When the driver saw the one hundred peso bill,

he asked, "Pigara ya?" with which I answered,

"Umm...duwara lang po."

While waiting for my sukli,

I looked down in the bayong and

realized that we forgot to buy something.

I looked to my aunt and said,

"Oh no tita, we forgot to buy the...

what do you call that...

the kuwan...the...

agamang?"
