# My field is practical philosophy

I need to embed myself in a field because [[Working in a field streamlines connecting]]. To find the right field, I follow [[thoughts/my criteria for choosing a field]]. Using these criteria, I have ruled out [[Fields adjacent to my field]] but are not directly working on the main questions I want to engage. After some thought, I have finally decided that [[Practical philosophy]] is a field I want to work in.

Below describes the thought process behind this decision:

The main question I try to answer in my work is [[thoughts/how should I live?]]

But why am I asking this question? What is it that I am ultimately trying to achieve?

I can properly answer these questions if the meaning of life is clear to me. Obviously, that is a fairly large topic that will take time to answer.

However, what seems clear to me right now is that I am engaged in two activities:

1. I am engaged in asking questions and searching for answers using both reason and experience. I am philosophizing.
2. I am engaged in philosophizing not for the sake of knowledge, but to better my life and to feel [[Ginhawa]].

So, what then is the name of the field of philosophy that is interested in applying philosophical knowledge to better one’s life? It seems like it is practical philosophy.

Aside from this, I have always resonated with the following:

1. I am constantly amazed by Nature and my existence.
2. I want to make the most of this existence.
3. I want to make the most of my existence by bettering myself.
4. By bettering myself (and because of it), I help build a better world one person at a time.

But, [[Do I really need a field?]]

***

​My field is [[spirituality]] or "consciousness practice”. If this is the case, I don't really have to start from zero. I am already surrounded by people who have their own practices of living consciously, people I can talk to about the art of living. [[We agree about what we want and disagree about metaphysics and epistemology]]. All I need to do is to be a gadfly amongst them and to communicate my truth in their midst to see if anyone would resonate (Note: This isn't true anymore. Revise.)
