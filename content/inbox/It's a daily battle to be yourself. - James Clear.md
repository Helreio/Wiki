# It's a daily battle to be yourself. - James Clear

"Being yourself is a continuous effort.

There is always another expectation placed upon you, another person pulling you toward their preferences, another nudge from society to act a certain way.

It's a daily battle to be yourself, not merely what the world wants you to be."
