**The Lessons (30 mins.)**

1. Look at your work like a harvest. Read and collect resonant information. Build a second brain. (Your attention is the harvester, 383, 387, 470)
   - Thoreau filled dozens of notebooks with extracts from hundreds of volumes, creating his own working library
      - There in the stacks Thoreau began his lifelong habit of keeping a permanent record of his reading by copying extracts into commonplace books.
         - He developed a passion for English poetry from Chaucer to Shakespeare
2. Turn your life into your greatest art.
   - Your system is your masterpiece. (His daily journal has become his masterpiece. Even more important than his books.)
   - Moving to Walden Pond was a one-person revolution in consciousness and a protest in the form of performance art.
   - he emphasized living “deliberately”; that is, living so as to perceive and weigh the moral consequence of our choices.
   - the choices we make create our environment, both political and natural—all the choices, even the least and most seemingly trivial.
   - he made of his life itself an extended form of composition, a kind of open, living book.
   - Thoreau’s writings are all autobiographical
   - encouraged every one of us to enter into the great experiment of life.
3. There is a second farm: your finances. Take care of your finances. Have multiple streams of income. But keep your life simple. (Surveyor, pencil business, lectures, book writing, article writing, handiwork, 381, 441
   - What were Thoreau’s expenses?
      - Travel
      - Rent at his family’s boardinghouse
   - How did Thoreau pay for his expenses?
      - Multiple streams of income:
         - Day laborer
         - Family’s pencil business
            - Of John’s two sons, it was Henry who got involved in the business; like his father, he was intrigued with machinery and loved to work with his hands. Thanks to Henry’s improvements, for a time Thoreau pencils were the best in America, sought by artists, engineers, surveyors, architects, carpenters, and writers—everyone who depended on a good pencil.
         - Land surveying business
         - Lecturing
         - Publishing articles
         - Publishing books
      - Keep your life simple.
4. Surround yourself with people like you no matter how few they are. Make the most of your relationships including family members. Keep in touch with peers and followers (382).
   - Mentor
      - Under Emerson’s roof, Thoreau consolidated his sense of himself as above all a writer—not a dilettante who published occasionally, but a true and focused professional patterned after Emerson’s own model, which Thoreau now witnessed daily.
5. Cultivate openness (combine what doesnt seem to be matched together: poetry and science, literature and blue-collar work, p. 369).
   - “A sturdy lad . . . who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not ‘studying a profession,’ for he does not postpone his life, but lives already.” (from Emerson’s Self-Reliance)
   - Religion
      - Thoreau became an exacting student of the Bible, and he went beyond it to read the scriptures of other major religions, including Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism, seeking for the true fountainhead of spiritual truth.
6. Respond to feedback but do what feels good for you (Margaret fuller's feedback, feedback from his stay in New York, deciding no longer to go to lecture tours)
7. Dare greatly (publishing A Week, being jailed, standing up against slavery, living in Walden, walking and doing his work despite criticism and naysayers from neighbors, suffering censorship).
   - Thoreau often found his voice silenced and censored
   - Thoreau struggled all his life to find a voice that could be heard despite the din of cynicism and the babble of convention.
8. Build your own life philosophy.
9. Notice that there is a distinction between the work you do for yourself and the work you do for others (see biography p. 368, 435

Others

- Find your muse
   - John Thoreau
- Embrace your place.
   - he moved to New York City and tried to be like other writers, mobile and market driven. It was a disaster.
- Show your work. Test your ideas on an audience.
   - He lectured there himself nearly twenty times in as many years, testing out his ideas before a live audience
- Embrace solitude

Why Thoreau?
