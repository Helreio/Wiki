# Lydia Netzer on Compulsory Education

What if we push the pause button on compulsory education?

What if these kids graduate at 19 instead of 18? What if there is no class of '21?

You know that 12 is an arbitrary number, right? Student advancement isn't biologically coded to end in June and resume in September twelve times. The amount of knowledge and the skills they need to pack into their heads in order to "graduate" does not magically coincide with the number of months and years before they become legal adults. Ask any homeschooler. If you look at your child, and remove the idea that school is from 7-2, 5 days a week, 9 months of the year, what you have standing there is a small person who has X years to be ready to go to college or go to work.

Getting ready for college or work doesn't actually take that long.

Do you still have a childcare problem for kids with working parents? Yes. But it is now clearly a **childcare** problem, and not a childcare problem conflated with a but-the-kids-need-to-leeeearrrrn problem.

Do you have children who need school to have a safe place to go and something to eat and caring eyes on them? Yes. It is not the same thing as needing urgently to learn fractions and about the Punic wars.

Do you still have a need for kids to connect with other kids outside their families and have a community of adults who care for them? Yes. But that's not the same thing as sitting in class for 7 hours a day.

If our urgent need is childcare for working parents, a social safety net for children who are living in poverty, and a community for our kids, let's focus on addressing those needs, and stop bundling them with learning to punctuate a sentence and how chlorophyll works, because those things **are not that urgent** and learning them requires neither a classroom nor a year.
