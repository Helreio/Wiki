# Change is Not Anthropocentric

The idea that change happens only through human agency is not very holistic.

There is another view of change, and that is nonviolent. We do our best to invite people to change. But it should remain an invitation. We can’t force then to change. The moment we force them, it ceases to be an invitation. It becomes a violent force to persuade them to change.

Change don’t only happen through human agency. Nature (animals, plants, nonsentient beings) also contribute to change in ways that we cannot see and measure. Everything is interconnected.

Human nature is affected not just by the human realm but also the natural world that even if humans fail to invite other humans to change, the natural world has its own means to (force?) change people.
