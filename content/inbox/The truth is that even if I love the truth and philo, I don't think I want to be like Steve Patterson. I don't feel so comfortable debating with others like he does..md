# The truth is that even if I love the truth and philo, I don't think I want to be like Steve Patterson. I don't feel so comfortable debating with others like he does.

My relationship with philosophy is only as far as it is useful for me.

Once settled with my worldview, I tweak as I go, then I focus on lighter stuff.

I focus on ginhawa and inducing it.
