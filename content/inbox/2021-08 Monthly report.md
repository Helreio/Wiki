# 2021-08 Monthly report

# Summary

This month, I was able to move my project of making this house a more hospitable space for guests. I finally hosted people in the house. Based on this hosting experience, I was able to come up with a minimum viable plan to improve the house for guests, which I did.

This month, I also learned how to be more empathetic towards my friends, specifically accepting criticism and holding space for vulnerable braveness. And I got rewarded with praise and admiration because of it. Meanwhile, I might need to learn how to do the same with Lea’s mom.

I experienced my first pottery workshop this month. But it was also a month of new food experiences: lipote wine, garlic vine on peanuts, binakol, Homespun carrot cake, tempeh, Ju’s sandwhich, the best takoyaki around, Lea’s pork sinigang, ang veggie spaghetti. Interestingly, me and Lea were also thinking about food this month. I was researching Weston A. Price and instituted an organic food regimen for Kako.

Finally, it was a contemplative month, made possible by a two-week long Facebook and Messenger detox. I was able to improve my reading inbox, think about my beliefs and engage with others about them, and realized how central my intellectual work is to my life and career.
