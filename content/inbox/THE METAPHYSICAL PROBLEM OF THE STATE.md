# THE METAPHYSICAL PROBLEM OF THE STATE

Suppose P was a state.

And, for simplicity's sake, suppose P was made up of only 5 individuals namely A, B, C, D, and E.

Suppose A dies and only four individuals are left, is it still the same state P?

Suppose B dies, is it the same state?

Suppose C dies, is it the same state?

Now, suppose only two idividuals are left, D and E, do they still make up the same state?

And, finally, suppose D dies and E is left alone, does E make up the same state P?

If so, then is individual E the state P all along?

Or is the state P gone?

If it is, then why wasn't P gone at the moment each of the first three individuals died?

Where did P begin and where did it end?

Does P even exist in the physical world?

This is just one of the many philosophical problems concerning the existence of any state like P. And yet despite it, we have always assumed that the state's existence is without question. We have even decided that it is of primary importance over that which we sure exists - the individual.
