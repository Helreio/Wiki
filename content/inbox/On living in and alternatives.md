# On living in and alternatives

Living in is still an option, although we have to thread it carefully to prevent it from destroying our relationship.

Lea should learn how to assert her right to leave the house whenever she wants to.

She should never make me feel like I need to compete with her family in terms of being with her.

It should be automatic that when a decision has to be made between being with me or being with her family, she would choose me.

She should never make me feel like I am secondary.
