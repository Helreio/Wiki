# Notes on Emotion

Emotions are an individual’s response to events, which are capable of triggering changes in both body and behavior.

A cross-disciplinary understanding of emotion involving philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology is necessary.

Emotions are historically conceptualized in three ways:

- as experiences
- as evaluations
- as motivations

Scientists and philosophers have tried to come up with a definition of emotions that is:

1. Compatible with ordinary language
2. Theoretically fruitful.

When scientists and philosophers try to arrive to a definition of emotions that is compatible with ordinary language, they are aiming for a descriptive definition.

When scientists and philosophers try to arrive to a definition of emotions that is theoretically fruitful but violates ordinary intuitions, they are aiming for a prescriptive definition.

There are different ways to arrive at a definition compatible with ordinary language:

- introspection
- thought experiments
- casual observation
- gleaning of insights from literary texts and other artistic sources
- experimental tests of ordinary intuitions and the psychological processes underlying them (experimental philosphy)

Folk emotion categories need to be homogenous enough to be useful for theoretical objectives.

The ideal goal of philosophers and scientists is to come up with prescriptive defintion of emotions that are as compatible with ordinary language as possible while being useful for theoretical objectives (i.e., prescriptive definitions are also descriptively adequate).

Folk emotion concepts differ from each other along several dimensions and cannot be used for theoretical generalizations.

In philosophy, theoretical fruitfulness is in the first person. It primarily means:

- making sense of the human experience of emotions
- explain the origins of rational action or moral judgment
- shed light on what makes life worth living
- investigating the nature of self-knowledge

In science, theoretical fruitfulness is in the third person. It primarily aspires:

- to find prescriptive definitions that promote measurement and experimentation for prediction and explanation

The word “emotion” came to English as a translation of a French term in the 17th and 18th centuries. It became systematically studied in the mid-19th century.

The words we associate with the word emotion today has been theoretically analyzed in Ancient Greece but with different labels.

There is no consensus about what emotions are both in philosophy and in affective science.

- MY NOTE: This is why I need to come up with my own concepttualization of emotion. I cannot rely on consensus.

According to many, emotions have components and these components are demonstrated in episodes.

The components of emotions are:

- evaluative
- physiological
- phenemenological
- expressive
- behavioral
- mental

The question is, which among these componenets is essential to emotion?

This question about the components of emotions has led to many theories of emotion in philosophy and affective science.

The three broad traditions of theories of emotions are;

1. Feeling tradition - how emotions feel is their most essential characteristic
2. Evaluative tradition - how emotions construe the world is their most essential characteristic; emotions are (or are made up of) distinctive evaluations of events
3. Motivational tradition - emotions are distinctive motivational states

All disciplines studying emotions share the following theoretical objectives:

1. Differentiation: How are emotions different from one another and from non-emotions?
2. Motivation: Do emotions motivate behavior? How?
3. Intentionality: Do emotions have intentions? Are there appropriate and inappropriate emotions based on their intentions?
4. Phenomenology: Do emotions always involve subjective experiences? What kind?

Each tradition is not immune from problems. Therefore, the most recent trend in emotion theory involves theories that combine insights from different traditions.

Emotions are simply a class of feelings, differentiated by their experienced quality from other sensory experiences

- This is the simplest theory of emotion and the most intuitive.
- This theory has dominated emotion theory from Ancient Greece to early 20th century.
- Proponents: Plato, Aristotle, Spinoza, Descartes, Hobbes, Hume, Locke
- Emotions involve feelings and they do not have components
- A similar but alternative idea is the James-Lange theory

James-Lange theory

- Called so because William James (1890) and Lange had similar theories.
- Emotions are feelings constituted by perceptions of changes in physiogical conditions relating to the autonomic and motor functions.
- E.g. Trigger → Bodily responses → (Awareness of these responses = Emotion)
- “Our feelings of [bodily] changes as they occur IS the emotion” (James, 1884: 189–190).
- “We feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and not that we cry, strike, or tremble, because we are sorry, angry, or fearful” (James, 1884: 190).
- This theory is the inspiration of the psychological constructionist movement in affective science

Criticisms on the James-Lange theory

- Fails with the challenges of motivation, differentiation, and intentionality
- If emotions do not cause their manifestations and instead emerge from them, then the importance of emotions are undermined. How could they be important if they do not cause actions? (Dewey, 1894; 1895)
- If emotions do not cause their manifestations and instead emerge from them, then science should explain the cause and function of the bodily changes instead.
- The differences between emotions is unclear in this theory (Walter Cannon, 1929). According to the theory, each emotion is different because each is a perception of different bodily changes. However, visceral reactions to different emotions sometimes can be indistinguishable. So reactions are not the best way to differentiate emotions.
- Current research has not established whether emotions do have different body profiles in the autonomic, expressive, and neural levels.
- Emotions can be explained and justified. But in this theory, emotions don’t have a role in our life as rational agents and thinkers.

Particular object vs formal object of an emotion

- Particular object = Any X that I can have emotion E about
- Formal object - The property which I implicitly ascribe to X by virtue of having E about X
- Example: A snake is a particular object of fear, while “that which constitutes danger” is the formal object of fear.

Particular objects and formal objects of emotions constitute the two principal aspects of emotional intentionality.

- Emotions are object-directed when they have particular objects.
- Emotions are fitting when their particular objects instantiate the formal objects represented by the emotion

There are two types of particular objects of emotions:

1. Target objects - the specific entity the emotion is about (not every emotion has a target).
2. Propositional objects - facts or states of affairs, real or imagined, towards which an emotion is directed (not all emotions have a propositional object)

Some propose that there are emotions or affective states that don’t have any of the two types of particular objects. They are emotions without objects. Some call these objectless emotions as “moods” (Frijda 1995; Stephen 2017a).

There are problems with this conceptualization though. If affective states have neither particular objects nor formal objects, it becomes hard to explain how they can be correct. This is because, formal objects are descriptions of what the world must be like for the affective state to happen.

If emotions have formal objects, it is necessitated that they also have particular objects to ascribe the property defined by the formal object.

If one believes that emotions have formal objects, then one needs to commit that each emotion, ascribes a specific property to its particular object conceptually.

The formal object of an emotion can be used as a justification of the emotion by citing that it elicited the emotion.
