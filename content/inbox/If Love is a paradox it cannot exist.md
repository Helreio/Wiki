# If Love is a paradox it cannot exist

OMG! Saan sa sinabi ko ang nagsuggest sayo na paradox ang Love?! Oh no, I didn’t mean that kap! In fact, I wouldn’t put Love in that category. True paradoxes will never be understood. In fact, they can't exist. If Love is a paradox, it cannot be bounded, it cannot be understood, and it cannot exist. That will be the end of it!
