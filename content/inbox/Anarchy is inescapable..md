# Anarchy is inescapable.

The concept of anarchy is simple: No one governs the self but the self.

I don't think it's even escapable.

Even the most political fanatic won't follow everything his stand tells him to do. And, most of the time, we handpick teachings to favor our behavior.

At the end of the day, it is the individual that acts, not the state.
