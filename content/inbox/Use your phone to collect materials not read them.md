# Use your phone to collect materials not read them

It is tedious to write [[literature notes]] ([[how to write literature notes]]) on your phone because you need to go back and forth between apps, since you can't put the two apps on the same screen. Even if you can do this, the screen is too small anyway.

Reading on your phone might work if you take literature notes using an analog writing material or another device. Even so, going back and forth between two devices can be disruptive to your thought process.

If you keep your [[Talahardin]] digitally, then read on a laptop where you can seamlessly switch between reading and note-taking. Reading on your phone then rereading on your laptop later for a second time to write [[Evergreens]] is inefficient.

That said, you can read on your phone if you just want to be entertained ([[Decide whether to read for fun or for learning]]).
