# The Creative Class

# *00 - Intro*

If you position yourself differently in your industry, for your audience, and on your own terms, doing so through a lot of focused work and research, you can feel stoked about your work, earn more money, and command more respect from clients.

Positioning well and effectively will prod you to create processes required to run your business so you can focus on your creativity.

“My goal isn’t to make the most money; it’s to do work that matches my internal compass and provides real value to other people."

**Key Points**

This only works if you do the work. Put in the time and effort and keep an open mind.

Find your path based on your values and motivations.

Use the systems and examples in the lessons as starting or jumping off points to create your own strategies.

Disagreeing is great! It means there’s critical thought.

Advice isn’t a shortcut to critical thought. Consider how each lesson relates to you and apply the advice to your work and your career

**Getting The Most From This Course**

Switch from “I know this already” to “What else can I learn?”

Be open. Experiment and step out of your comfort zone.

# *01 - Purpose*

Define why you do the work you do - and create a powerful decision-making filter in the process.

Knowing your purpose is one of the most important parts of any freelance business.

Your purpose is the lens through which you filter all your business decisions, from the tiny to the monumental.

- Who you work with
- What you offer
- Where you focus your time and energy
- How you define your audience

Figuring out your purpose requires actual reflection

- What are your desires?
- What audience do you want to serve?

Business is really just about serving others in a mutually beneficial way.

- They give you money, gratitude, and a shared passion.
- You give them your ability to solve their problems through the application of your skills.

Your purpose is simply how you express your impact to clients. It combines the heart and the brain. It is how and why you help your audience.

Questions

- What do you find most satisfying about serving your audience? (e.g. Do you love to see them succeed and grow their businesses? Do you like to feel valuable or serve as a mentor? Do you enjoy building a diverse portfolio of happy clients?)
- What does your audience need, crave, or want more of in their lives and work?
- What makes you different from every other freelancer who shares your skillset?
- When you’re more interested and engaged in the process than the final outcome, what problems do you like to solve?
- What are you doing for others when you’re at your best? When you’re at your happiest? When you feel a sense of concentration and flow?
- What do you do that leaves other people (and the world at large) better than how you found them?
- Why did you start your freelance business in the first place (beyond earning money or paying the bills)?
- What does your business stand for? What do you want to accomplish for yourself – and achieve for your clients?

Benefits of having a clear purpose for your business

- Keeps you motivated even during tough moments
- Keeps you motivated to continue serving your audience
- Keeps you motivated to keep growing and adding value to the work you do
- Litmus test for business decisions, which enables you to make smart, prompt and more confident choices in all areas of your freelance work

You know you’ve accurately defined your own purpose if you can distill it down to a clear, one- to two-sentence statement.

Four points to come up with your own concise purpose statement

1. Your skills - what you do for the clients, customers, or audience you serve
2. Your focus - how you apply your skills to the work you want to do
3. Your audience - who you work with (or want to work with)
4. Your solution - what you do for your audience that makes their business (or life) better than before they hired you; it has to be something your audience is eager to pay for (an “expensive problem”)

Each point adds more color and shading to the basic line drawing of what you do.

As you think about the solution you provide, go beyond the skills you sell to express the reasons why people want to hire you.

Why people hire content strategists

- They want higher sales
- They want more subscribers and shares
- They want better content which helps them achieve the above

Use your purpose statement is your website to attract the right clients.

Use your purpose statement as a decision-making compass:

- When considering a new client, do they match the audience you’ve defined? Will they benefit from the solution you provide?
- When showcasing previous work, does it highlight or diminish your purpose?
- When creating content, does it align with and enhance your purpose?

Your gut instincts are a good reflection of your purpose. Your gut is your internal purpose-checker. It will warn you if you’re veering away from your purpose or it needs to change.

If you don’t take time defining your purpose at the beginning, you might end up realizing that you’re not enjoying what you’ve worked so hard to build.

Defining your purpose has more to do with your personal values, morals, and ethics than business plans or marketing strategies.

If you don’t feel a deep connection to your purpose, no one else will feel it either.

# *02 - Audience*

Find an audience that has common problems and motivations, and that values the work you do.

Lack of focus can hurt your career.

**What are the benefits of defining your audience?**

By serving a niche audience and ignoring the outliers, you catch a target market that has common reasons for hiring freelancers, as well as common problems that need solving. They are also motivated by shared principles, bothered by similar shortcomings, and feel amped up about the same ideas.

By thinking small, specialized and focusing on a specific audience, you can tailor everything you do to this niche group and own the space as the “go-to” person.

A narrow focus allows you to precisely direct your attention, in terms of marketing, connecting and targeting.

**When does casting a wide net make sense?**

In some scenarios, especially if you’re really good at what you do.

**When is casting a wide net a weak plan?**

If you’re not getting enough clients or you’re not getting the clients you want.

**How to define your audience**

Experiment. Analyze the results. And revise if necessary.

Your audience is at the intersection of:

1. Your expertise
2. Your own definition of meaningful work
3. The people who value that work enough to pay good money for it

Look for an audience that:

1. Excites you
2. You understand (even a little)
3. Value what you know and do

Do your research until you find that sweet spot

**Requirements for your audience**

1. You have to like them. Your audience should include people that you genuinely like, admire, and want to spend time helping and interacting with on a daily basis.
2. Your audience should have a clear history of hiring skilled freelancers.
3. Your audience should have budgets that support contract work.
4. Your audience should recognize the value in paying for your services.

**What you should do with your audience**

1. Know their pains and motivations
2. Show up on their radar

**How to know your audience’s pains and motivations**

Ask

1. What are the common results they achieve by hiring skilled freelancers?
2. What common challenges do they share that could be addressed by hiring a kick-ass contractor?

**How to show up on your audience’s radar**

- Attend events they attend to and start some conversations.
- Leave intelligent and useful comments on the websites and blogs they read.
- Follow people you like and admire and connect with them on the social networks your audience love.
- Connecting doesn’t mean constantly pitching people to hire you; it means talking to people and interacting like a real human being.
- You should genuinely enjoy these interactions and love serving your online community.

**The sweet spot where magic happens for freelancers**

An intersection of:

- An audience that excites you
- An audience that you understand (even a little)
- An audience who value what you know and do

**Questions to ask**

- What type of work do you enjoy the most?
- What type of client would you never want to serve?
- What kind of work is totally off the table for you?
- Do you enjoy your target audience enough to immerse yourself in their industry?
- What unique value do you bring to the people you want to serve?
- What are you offering them?
- What makes that offering unique?
- Why would they want it?
- Are you willing to provide new and valuable content on a regular basis?

---

**People you don’t want to work with**

You need to know who and what kind of organizations you won’t work with.

You won’t work with:

- Clients morally misaligned with you
- Clients from an industry or community that you don’t want to join
- Project requiring you to use skills you don’t want to use or pursue
- Clients you don’t understand and who don’t understand you
- Clients who work in a field that your intended audience doesn’t care about or actively rejects
- If they don’t see the value in what you do and continually try to undermine your rates, your time or your boundaries

If times are tight and you’re just starting out, you’ve got to say yes more often than you can say no. But as you grow your freelancing business, your time and expertise become more valuable and give you the freedom to turn down incompatible projects or clients.

Research -> How you describe your work

Don’t just list previous projects

Explain why and how your work is valuable to your target audience.

**Portfolio**

- A catalogue of past work.
- A clear definition of future work.
- Should anticipate and reflect the values, definitions and motivations that you heard in your client interviews.
- Tailor your portfolio to speak directly to their goals and needs.

Align your pitch with the work you want to attract.

**Ask yourself**

- What are the common words or phrases?
- What are the common motivations, goals, and overall sentiments?
- What are the common pain points or frustrations?
- What do people and companies look for when hiring someone like me?

**Website**

- What you do
- Who you serve
- What makes you different
- What makes you more valuable
- Tell a compelling story
- List clients and projects
- But connect your services to the results people will achieve by hiring you
- Homepage: Focus on landing more client work
- Use common words and phrases that emerged during your research

**How To Do A Portfolio**

Headline

- Most important
- Speak to a common pain point that emerged during your research.
- Change headline until you strike gold.
- Use A/B tests using Optimizely or Unbounce

Establish your audience

- Who is your work for?
- Who doesn’t it serve?
- Clarify your targets to bring in more focused and relevant leads.

Offer and empathetic solution

- How does your work address the problems your clients are facing?
- How can you describe this value in language that your audience understands?
- How can you highlight the positive changes that occur when people work with you?
- What tangible results can you share from previous projects?

Show proof

- List of clients
- Testimonials
- Case studies
- Success stories
- Be strategic about what you show
- Your portfolio isn’t just a sample of your previous work; it’s a template for the type of work you’re going to bring in.
- As soon as possible, remove the projects that don’t match your goals and dreams. Take out projects that don’t represent the scope of work you like doing. And take out projects that involved clients you didn’t like or enjoy helping. Relentlessly edit the work you showcase. It’s better to share a few “perfect fit” projects than a dozen that don’t represent where you’re going.

Leverage scarcity

- Be honest, but show that your capacity is limited (since there are only so many hours in a day)
- How many clients per month?
- How many spots available?
- Prospective clients will feel both a sense of urgency and they’ll respect your busy schedule.

Offer a simple way to connect

- Get in touch call to action?
- Free initial consult?
- Email address or phone number?

Use Story and Personality

- How are you different from other freelancers?
- What do you bring to the process that will make life easier, more productive, more profitable or more fun for your clients?
- How do you deliver results?
- Let your talents, quirks and interests shine through so you can stand out from the freelance pool. What makes you different and unique?

Website introduction

- Address client pains or motivations
- Target a specific audience
- Put personality

Onboarding

Guiding prospects from first interest to a signed contract.

# *Interview: Trevor McKendrick on Taxes and Accounting*

**When should I incorporate as a freelancer and how should I do it?**

As soon as you realize that you are going to do this at least half time.

**How should you do it?**

LLC

**Why?**

For legal problems.

**Private websites vs. state government website?**

Government website

Hire accountants to help you prevent the government from getting more money from you.

**How to hire or choose an accountant?**

Start with someone small but knows your stuff.

**How can I avoid being audited?**

Don’t skip your taxes in purpose.

There are different kinds of audit: letter, office, and field.

Products-based businesses are more tedious to manage accounting-speaking than service-based freelance businesses.

Separate personal and business accounts

---

# *Interview: Brennan Dunn on Pricing*

**Why not negotiate your rates with a potential client?**

You have to present yourself as an investment instead of an expense.

Do not provide a commoditized offering.

Position yourself as a non-interchangeable expert to your clients.

Negotiation happens when there’s a high-perceived risk.

When you disqualify them to your service it’s a mutual fit. It means you’re not the right person for them and they’re not the right person for you.

**Mistakes freelancers make about pricing**

Using rates based on your personal needs instead of industry rates.

**How to charge value-based?**

Have a conversation with the client and try to uncover the underlying desires he has which triggered him to contact you. After that, create a proposal: here’s the problem, here’s the solution we’ll be doing, here are different options (tiers), and this is what I will do for you.

Use the word report rather than proposal.

**How to use dates?**

Use dates not to reflect how long a job should be done but instead when clients should expect the deliverables (which should have a leeway in case life happens).

**Positioning**

Do not let the client set what the game plan is. Instead, teach the client to give you the problem and be the one to think about the solution.

“This is the solution to your problem and this is how it will cost."

vs

“Tell me what to do and I’ll do it."

**Should a freelancer ever work for free?**

You’re high risk.

You’re new.

You don’t have a portfolio.

Do something for free if what you do is evergreen (do once and will serve you in repeat: course, blog) and delivered at scale.

**Positioning through audience**

Use teaching to position yourself.

Do guest posting (borrow other people’s audience).

**Raising prices on existing clients**

You can’t change prices by not changing the product.

I will be raising fees in the next 2 months as I add this service.

You will get the additional service now for free but I will be raising fees in the next 2 months.

It can’t be about you. It has to be how can they be better off by paying you more.

**Firing a client**

Unparticipative clients

No communication

Set expectations. This is my responsibility and this is yours.

**Offering different skills**

You are the one driving the boat and you have to present yourself as such.

Writers, designers, developers (BIG 3)

**Pricing retainer agreements**

Pricing availability in the future

Monthly

Don’t do the availability per month with a discount

Only offer retainer pricing when you have services that are:

- Ensure
- Optimize
- Coaching/Advisory

Don’t assume that since people are not contacting you they don’t need you
