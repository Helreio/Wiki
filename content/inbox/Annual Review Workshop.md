## A Brief Introduction to Annual Reviews

Why do we do an annual review?

- We review to check whether what we set out to do is in fact what we wanted to do.
- Review connects Sky (goals, aspirations, purpose, etc.) with Ground (our actions).

The basic parts of an annual review

- Recalling memory (using memory aids is helpful)
- Writing down what you recall.
- Reflecting on what you recall.
- A reason for doing all these (the best reason is using this to inform your next year)

It is easier to remember if you have already been tracking things even before the annual review.

What do we need to track?

- Actually we only need to track two things:
   - Positive events that generates gratefulness, learning, and a sense of growth.
      - Things that happened to us
      - Things that we did
      - Things that we consumed
   - Seemingly negative events that caught our attention and may have some hidden lessons within them.
