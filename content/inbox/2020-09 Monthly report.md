# 2020-09 Monthly report

## Summary

This month was filled with wins that it could have easily been the best month of 2020 for me. First, I lost 6 kilos from dieting. This was also the month where Lea and I celebrated our first anniversary as a couple. I was able to put the finishing touches of my minimum viable life management system by studying and articulating a project management system. After ending this major project, I felt empty and realized that a life management system is not enough to make me happy. I need to cultivate happiness habits every day and pursue projects that actually enhance my happiness more directly. One such project was inviting friends to meet weekly, which became Fruit Salad. Within Fruit Salad, I would first work on a workshop on the creative process of Thoreau. Another thing that really made this month rich was the beginnings of my deeper exploration of nature. It was partly influence by watching the film, My Octopus Teacher, but I was also heavily encouraged by Thoreau. One important lesson I learned this month was: Being yourself is already a service.
