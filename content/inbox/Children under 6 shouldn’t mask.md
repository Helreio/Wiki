# Children under 6 shouldn’t mask

The WHO says that children under 6 shouldn’t mask. Most of Europe don’t require it. Young people are not prone to contract the virus, and they need to see faces, specially those with disabilities. A CDC study failed to show a statistically significant benefit of masking kids in school.

When it’s worn correctly and replaced regularly, the blue medical mask can only contain the virus for about 10%. N95 do better but we can’t wear them for so long. 10% reduction for adults might be justifiable but not for children.
