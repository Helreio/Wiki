# Imagine a Life With No Money

Imagine a life with no money. Few of us can think that such reality can even exist. But that is because we have not delved deeper on the subject - we have not escaped the box and we have not studied the history of this thing that we have wrapped our lives and goals around.

The truth is, money is a pretty recent creation. For example, in the Philippines, money as we know it now was only institutionalized during the American colonial period, that is from 1901 to 1945 (?). Of course there were forms of currencies during the Spanish colonial period and even before that but they are very different from the complex global money economy we currently live on. This economy is only 100 years old. For someone who does not have a grasp of historical time, that might already be too old, but it isn’t. The Filipino money economy is still young.

And yet we feel like it was here since time immemorial and that it will be here forever! We are unable to think outside of it, to conceptualize alternatives, to think: what was here before money came?

Before money came in the Philippines - and that also means before the colonialists came - most lived a subsistence life. Hunting, gathering, and later on farming, were at the heart of the economy. There was no complex technology that will only run through an also complex money economy. Technologies like electricity or fuel, whose consumption has caused a lot of environmental problems, was not existent. Life had a very minimal ecological impact.

This isn’t talked about a lot, but many of pre-monetary societies had elements of “gift culture”. Because there was no money to facilitate economic transactions, communities exchanged physical goods. This made people more dependent on each other thus creating more tightnit communities. In such cultures, the more generous a person is, the stronger his or her social status. This is quite different from a money economy where most money gurus preach “savings” and “accumulation” as a noble path. According to this view, accumulation will make one “financially independent”, a term which means not needing to work for money but which also implies not needing to depend much on neighbors, loved ones, and community because one already has the money. Money has replaced community.

This is not the case in pre-monetary Filipino societies which had elements of gift culture. (Site example of large feasts).

What happened when the money economy came was that it converted things that was once in the realm of gift into things that can be monetized and marketed - this became true with both goods and skills. Food was simply grown - gifted by the earth - but now, we buy most of it. Tattoos didn’t have an “exact price,” but they were held in much reverence and having them was prestigous. They were paid with (cite exhibit info) and yet today one can go to Buscalan and have a tattoo for only ₱100 putting it at par with a Jollibee meal. Money made things that were once “free and cheap” expensive and things that were once “revered and sacred” cheap.

Can A World Without Money Happen?

Of course! Money is not part of nature. We created it and therefore we can destroy it. We can reconceptualize it to make it less violent. Or we can replace it altogether with a better alternative. Or we can simply get rid of it and return to a gift economy, designed of course to fit our present complex world.

Living Without Money Today

Is it possible to live without money in today’s world?

Yes! (Cite examples) I am yet to find a Filipino example but I believe someone had thought about this and experimented on it.

Another Alternative: Living In Transition

You might not be able to live totally without money but at least you can do two things:

1. Lessen your dependence on it.
2. Lessen your economic impact.

Try to minimize what is in the sphere of money: grow your own food.

Invest on community not on the stock market.

Live simply.

Find passions that dont require money. Going out with friends need a lot of money, inviting them over at your house might be less cheaper (?)
