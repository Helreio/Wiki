“I decided to slow down, carefully choose a much smaller number of books, and save my notes from those books in a system of knowledge management – which I call my “Second Brain.” I decided I would rather deeply absorb the wisdom of a small handful of books than speed-read my way through dozens.”

“Creating a book summary requires a surprising amount of creativity. Because the truth is, these are much more than summaries. They are actually reinterpretations. By choosing certain points over others and deciding how they’ll be presented, I am interpreting the book through my own personal lens.”

“Like any retelling, your summary is biased, but it can be biased helpfully. It can be biased toward usefulness, toward relevance, and toward actionability.”

“You have a particular audience, and you know that audience. You know what they tend to miss, what they need, and what they desire in their heart of hearts. You can therefore afford to be FAR more discerning and opinionated.”

“In fact, I think you owe it to your readers to be opinionated. They rely on you to tell them what matters about the book – which points are the most original and important. They depend on you to climb the mountain and come back with the most precious gems. You have done the hard work, and now you are paving the way for others to follow in your footsteps.”

“This isn’t an easy process. Each summary requires 10-20 hours of intellectual labor. But looking back at the last few years, these hours have been some of the most valuable I’ve spent toward building an audience of loyal readers, and ultimately creating the content and courses that fuel my business.”

“Allows me to absorb the book’s lessons on a much deeper level

Creates building blocks for my own thinking and creating

Improves my writing through imitation

Builds my audience of email subscribers

Connects me with influential people

Expands my visibility and credibility in online communities”

“The moment I decide to summarize a book, it’s as if my vision suddenly sharpens. I begin to pay closer attention and read with a more critical eye. I’m less willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt. I start to question their statements and conclusions and to examine the supporting evidence.”

“As I decide what to highlight, which is the very first step of summarizing, I’m practicing my judgment – the skill of deciding what matters and what doesn’t, what’s important and what’s not, and what’s interesting and what isn’t. I’m training my ability to notice what is most relevant and valuable.”

“Summarizing a book requires you to make value judgments at every stage of the process. This forces you to think about the material more deeply and reflect on how you want this new wisdom to be applied to your life.”

“I’ve found that with the best ideas from books summarized on my blog, I can directly link to them as specific, concrete sources. I can write something like “As discussed in Emergent Strategy…” and link to my own summary, instead of to an Amazon page and expecting my readers to somehow read an entire book to understand what I’m talking about.”

“That link leads to another place inside the world of ideas I’m creating. It points to an article written by me, in my own language, with my own framing. I don’t have to interrupt what I’m writing to explain all the backstory, nor do I have to leave my readers behind.”

“This is how my blog becomes more than the sum of its parts – my posts make up an interconnected web of thinking that others can follow in any direction and read in any order. I can build one idea atop another, which allows me to take my readers along on my journey knowing they can trace my footsteps. Sharing that common knowledge, I’m able to move further and faster in my thinking without having to stop and explain the background again and again.”

“This way of thinking is less like a passive consumer and more like a researcher. You have a body of research that you are growing and refining over time. You have hypotheses and questions that, if answered, will lead you closer to your research goal. And you are part of a network of collaborators constantly sharing their thinking and building atop one another’s work.”

“Eventually I noticed something else: When I summarized a book, I inhabited the author’s state of mind.”

“10 to 20 hours is a significant amount of time to spend with someone’s thinking. It is more like doing an apprenticeship or taking a class than reading a book.”

“A classic piece of writing advice is to copy out the writing of your favorite authors, by hand and word for word. This is the writer’s equivalent of imitating an athlete’s movements or a musician’s signature style.”

“By imitating the thought patterns and language of the person whose work you are summarizing, you get to inhabit the mind of a master. But it is even better than pure imitation: You are riffing on their words, weaving them in and out of your own explanations.”

“Summarizing books is an excellent way to get on people’s radar. Because they often already have an intention to read one of these books, seeing a summary feels like a timesaver when compared to the time required to read the whole book.

I am tapping into the existing reputation of a book and its author and curating its best ideas for the many people who are too busy to read it themselves. Instead of asking them to do me a favor (Hey, please read my post!) it feels like I am doing them a favor (Hey, here’s a 15-minute summary instead of a five-hour book!).”

“All this boils down to one fact: When you save people time, they are grateful. They want to hear more from you. That’s why they subscribe, tell their friends to subscribe, and share your links on social media – because you provided value upfront.”

“5. Connects me with influential people

Eventually, I started to gain enough of a public profile that I could reach out to the authors themselves.”

“Make no mistake: Over time, these kinds of relationships can have a dramatic impact on your career, your business, and your life. These are people you can’t buy access to. They won’t be bribed or flattered. They are people who care about ideas, and the path to their heart is only through ideas.

Just remember that they don’t owe you anything, and you shouldn’t expect anything. Making contact should be considered an extra bonus, since you never know who will be open to connecting.

But if they do respond, these can be incredibly fruitful collaborations for both parties.”

“6. Expands my visibility and credibility in online communities”

“The number of communities you can meaningfully participate in will always be severely limited because there are so many. You can’t be everywhere at once, nor should you try.

However, book summaries are unique in their ability to slip into conversations. Because they focus on providing value instead of self-promotion, most community moderators will allow them to be shared. Often, they will be grateful to you for providing a valuable conversation starter, since they are always preoccupied with keeping the community engaged.”

“Summarizing a book and sharing it with a group of people who have already signaled their interest in it is the opposite of spam. It is a generous, honest, and helpful way of contributing to the knowledge of others.”

“Notice that none of the books I’ve summarized are mega-bestsellers. There would be no point to that, because bestsellers are already well known. They are often available in many formats and summaries already exist online.

Instead of bestsellers, I look for books that are on the fringes of the topics I care about. Ones that my followers aren’t likely to see if it wasn’t for my summary. I look for subjects where I can move the needle, connecting topics or ideas or groups of people that are likely to have answers to each others’ questions.”

“As a 10-20 hour endeavor, it should be reserved only for the most important, impactful, life-changing books you encounter. Think of it as the high-pressure power-washing of reading, reserved only for the most extreme jobs.”

“Generally, I read books that meet as many of these three criteria as possible:

They are interesting and captivate my attention

They are unique and have something original to say

They are helpful in addressing the problems that my readers and I are facing”

“The books I summarize have to meet an even higher bar. They have to be so interesting, so unique, and so helpful that the time I put into summarizing them will actually save me time in the long run. In other words, books that are such foundational building blocks in my work that by investing the time upfront to summarize them, I’m saving my future self the time of having to explain them over and over.”

“When you put in the effort to summarize an entire book, you are building a bridge from your audience to a topic they’re unlikely to read about on their own. You are lowering the threshold for how much time someone needs to spend to access its ideas, from hours to minutes.”

“Bridge-building isn’t easy, but it’s more important than ever. We’re all descending deeper and deeper into our filter bubbles as the algorithms feed us only what we already believe. It seems to be getting harder to discover points of view outside our own. We need ambassadors and translators who are willing to do the work of introducing us to foreign ideas we might never encounter on our own.”

“I follow five steps to go from reading a book to publishing a summary blog post:

Read and highlight

Export highlights

Progressively summarize

Outline

Write”

“Step 1: Read and highlight”

“Most books take five to ten hours to read, which is the single largest investment of time you’ll make. So you want to avoid having to repeat this step more than once.”

“To enable you to read straight through the book in one pass, you’ll combine reading with highlighting.”

“Highlighting is not supposed to be an end in itself. It is just the starting point in a much longer process.”

“highlighting results in deeper thinking and better retention.”

“Highlighting is one essential link in a chain of deep engagement with a text. It allows you to read efficiently without constant interruption. It takes barely a few extra seconds to highlight a word or phrase that you’re already reading anyway.”

“The ease of digital highlighting is the main reason I recommend ebooks.”

“My preferred platform is Amazon Kindle, because I’ve found the highlighting and export to be very reliable. I also occasionally use Apple Books for ebooks from other sources.”

“As I read, I’m constantly asking myself the same three questions that I used to decide what to read in the first place:

Is it unique?

Is it helpful?

Is it interesting?”

“These questions serve as a threefold lens allowing me to focus only on the content that is most valuable.”

“These guidelines might seem straightforward, but it takes practice to apply them consistently. As you read, it’s tempting to indiscriminately highlight an entire paragraph (or page) with a vague notion of “I’m sure something in here is interesting.”

But I encourage you to take an extra moment to ask yourself, “What exactly in this paragraph or page is worth keeping?” Those extra moments of consideration on the front end will save you hours later on.”

“Do’s:

Do highlight chapter titles and section headings – this ensures your exported notes will preserve the structure of the book.

Do highlight lists and summaries already found within the book – this is valuable summarizing work the author has already done for you.

Do highlight “popular highlights” (a feature of some ebook services such as Kindle which shows you phrases that many other people have highlighted) – these are phrases that other readers have already told you are helpful in their understanding of the text.”

“Don’ts:

Don’t highlight entire paragraphs or pages – this will create a lot of work later on to figure out what is actually valuable in those large chunks of text.

Don’t highlight entire stories or long examples – they are usually too long, and you can always go back and find them if you need them.

Don’t highlight ideas or explanations that you already know, agree with, or could have guessed – focus on what is novel, surprising, and counterintuitive.”

“2. Export highlights”

“3. Progressively summarize”

“Here’s the main idea: Every passage you’ve highlighted and exported has a point. But there are two problems:

It’s not always clear what the main point is

You need some of the surrounding context to understand what the point means”

“Progressive Summarization solves both problems at once by getting closer and closer to the main point in multiple passes, in a clearly marked way that shows you the necessary context around it. And it does this in the flow of reading so you don’t get interrupted.”

“Here’s the wonderful thing about Progressive Summarization: Not only can it be done a little bit at a time over long periods of time — that’s how it should be done.”

“No one has time to sit down and do multiple passes on the same text all at once. And even if you do, I often find this results in worse summaries, since you can’t see the text objectively after looking at it for so long.”

“You can and should do one pass at a time, and the text will be waiting for you whenever you get back around to it. I’ve found that the more time goes by between passes, the more objective I can be about what’s truly worth keeping.”

“After you’ve progressively summarized your notes, you’ve gone from 10% of the book to around 1%. That 1% makes up the richest, most insight-dense, most interesting and unique material. It is the core of insight around which the rest of the book revolves.

Instead of losing those nuggets in a sea of examples and explanations, you’ll make them the central pillars of your summary.”

“4. Outline”

“Which ideas do I want to attach my reputation to? Which ones are worth hours of writing, rewriting, and broadcasting to the world? Which arguments or explanations can my summary improve upon?”

“The outline should be hierarchical, which reflects the hierarchical structure that your final summary will follow:

Main point

Supporting point

Supporting point

Supporting point”

“Outlining is the only step that I strongly recommend you sit down and complete in one sitting.”

“Only then can you compare and contrast and interconnect them into one structure in your mind.”

“The final step involves stringing together the pearls of wisdom you’ve painstakingly selected into a beautiful necklace of reason. Because you have all the context you’ll need saved in your notes, you can spread out the writing process over time.”

“Customize your language to your own audience”

“Leave out parts that are boring, obvious, or too long”

“you are writing a curated, abridged version of only the parts you find relevant.”

“Every word in your summary dilutes the emphasis on everything else, so don’t be afraid to leave out even entire chapters if they don’t add value.”

“Be selective with your examples and metaphors”

“add your own examples and metaphors of how you’ve seen the ideas play out in your own work and life.”

“Don’t include direct quotes unless absolutely necessary”

“it is far more powerful to fully translate the author’s words into your own.”

“Curation has evolved from a specialized profession to a simple matter of staying informed about your field. But in curating information for ourselves, we also have the opportunity to surface the knowledge we’ve gained for others.”

“By taking the time to curate and summarize the work of others, you can offer people a way to access ideas they wouldn’t have the time to research themselves. You can lower the bar for how much effort it takes to engage with a new idea, in a way that informs while also being entertaining. More than ever, we need curators who are willing to distill what they know to just the essentials and then deliver that knowledge in engaging and understandable ways.”
