# Systematization creates Ginhawa.

I feel good when in nature because I see beauty. And what is beauty but simply a joy brought by the perception of patterns. Beauty can be seen in nature as it is from an intricately designed machine. Beauty is not just confined in nature or in art. It is everywhere even in the assembly line in the factory.

The brain is innately looking for patterns. Our ability to see patterns allows us to see beauty and to feel the ginhawa that witnessing beauty creates.

My appreciation of nature and my desire to create systems are interconnected - tightly.
