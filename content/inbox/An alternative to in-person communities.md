# An alternative to in-person communities

In-person communities are increasingly difficult to build due to the increasing individualism in modern societies.

Here is an alternative:

1. Build a strong family life.
2. Build a strong circle of friends who don’t necessarily share your thinking, but have your best interets in mind.
3. Find your tribe online and invest in them.
4. If there are opportunities to be with your digital tribe, take advantage of it whether it is a quick meet-up, doing a project together for a few days, or relocating near them.
