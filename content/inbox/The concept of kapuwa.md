# The concept of kapuwa

The concept of kapuwa in Filipino psychology suggests that individuals are not one. There is a “puwang” between each other. But despite this puwang, we are interconnected, thus the prefix “ka”.

This works well with my [[Metaphysical pluralism]], which also agrees with [[thoughts/dualism]].
