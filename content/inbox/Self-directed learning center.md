# Self-directed learning center

The self-directed learning center should be a neutral space, that is, a space where no metaphysical assumptions are assumed. It is non-sectarian, where people come to talk about their needs, not their differences. Everyone is welcome, including sectarian and spiritual people, as long as they are willing to leave their baggages behind.
