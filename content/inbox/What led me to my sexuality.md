# What led me to my sexuality

I was raised in a Christian Evangelical househould (1992-2012). Masturbation was prohibited as well as watching porn. But I did them anyway. But I was filled with guilt every after I did them because I held this clean, exemplary image at the congregation as a young pastor and RP.

I was raised in a household where the relationship philosophy is complementarism (patriarchy). I never really had a true girlfriend when I was a JW, but I had this understanding that if I will have one and we get married, she will be subordinate to me. She will only serve a supporting role. And it won’t be a problem, beause women in the congregation expect this.

There was no structure and opportunity from which I could explore myself sexually. I never knew my sexual preferences and kink until after I left. All I knew was my orientation—I was attracted only with the opposite sex). I was poorly sex educated.

This affected my mental health in ways I have yet to uncover. I was depressed after I masturbated after a long time of repressing my feelings. The erotic equation Attraction + Obstacles = Excitement, appllied to me.

My entire life, I was forced into hyper-masculinity and there was no alternative even when I was a beta male.

I learned of cuckolding through porn, which is a bad way of learning about it. I was already watching cuckolding porn in 2015 when I was living with JV at UPD for one month. I can’t point to when this kink really started but from 2011 until that point, I was watching all sorts of porn. Before that I was only watching porn where there is just one guy involved. But since 2011, I watched 2M and 2F then gangbangs and castings. I also realized I get turn on by young women fucking older guys. Why? Am I turned on by the domination? Who do I resonate with—the older guy or the younger woman? This is a good puzzle. But one thing is for sure, I am turned on when there is a power dynamic involved.

There seems to be a relationship between the breakup and my current sexuality. I think it affects how I react to real-life cuckolding. I do not feel regret and anxiety when Lea talks dirty with men in chat. The regret and anxiety only happens in solo dates when I don’t see everything. My mind seems to associate this with the pain from cheating.

What do I need to do to improve:

- I need to continue working on fully accepting myself.
- I need to know the value I bring to my relationship.
- Think about my history, process it, accept it, then own it.

The regret and angst after the first cuckolding experience was tough. But I learn my biggest lessons from tough experience.
