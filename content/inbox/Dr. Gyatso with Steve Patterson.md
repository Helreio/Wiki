# Dr. Gyatso with Steve Patterson

In Buddhism, the Self is a construct

Consciousness csn go on withoit the “my”

Isnt the existence of different perspectives a proof of a self

You are always changing

But if the Self exists, it shouldn’t change

When something is always in flux, it undermines its ability to have an essence (Aristotle)

Main critique of Buddhism is on essence

The mere fact that we can communicate shows that our perspectivres overlap

So is it the case that there is no separate selves and that what exists is one big consciousness divided by individuals?

No.

The Buddhist is problematizing on the constant shifting of the “self” not yet on its nature.

Things are happening but they dont have an identity.

If they dont have an identity then they are not really things.

So: they are happening even if they are without identity.

So what are u referencing when u say “thing”?

I am referencing it on whatever angle

CONCLUSION: the self is still a thing. But it is to group a collection of selves that occur at every moment.

Buddhism on paradox or logical contradiction

Are paradoxes meant to get us to deeper premises about the constructions of the world?

Or do they accept that there are paradoxes that exist and we just have to deal with them

But not UNITY or all is one

The relativity or interdependence rather than UNITY

Buddhism do not reject differences. Differences exist but they are relative not absolute.

Steve’s Breakdown

What physically exists are base units of space time

Those units are arranged in particularly ways.

We reference particular arrangements of space time as “objects.”

Base units arranged in a particular way.

Observer comes and calls this arrangement something.

The word represents a mental concept of the arrangement in the person’s mind.

If I conceive it, it exists.

If I am not conceiving of it, it stops to exist.

Buddhists extend this to the “self.”

The self is not an independent thing.

Meditation will show you who you really are: not a self.

I disagree with it but it is beautiful.

Their argument is

- Our conception of the self gives us all kinds of problems
- Because our concepts construct our selves, they construct the world, we mistake the true nature of existence
- True nature of existence is without essence
- Your mind is tricking you that the things you think through your mind are independently existing phenomena
- Path to enlightenment is not using conceptions but experiencing what your mind actually is doing.
- Hindu: all is one.

It exists but as an illusion?

Reluctant position of Steve

- If it is true that there is a thing called the self which exists even if it isn’t being conceived, that forced you to accept the existence of the soul.
- Either u have a self or u dont have one
- If self is conceptually constructed then it is illusory.
- If self is not conceptually constructed then a soul exists
- The internal experience of subjectivity is so powerful it is difficult to reject the existence of a self.
- In order to have change you must have essence

We give identity when we communicate all the time

But those identities are again products of our existence

To exist is to be someway (identity)

Buddhists are denyting identity. There is no true identity only conceptual.

Everything is infinite?

Causes a lot of confusion

Central to Buddhism

No base anything

Infinite regress

If you have infinite parts you have no parts

To not have a logical contradiction you must believe that there are finite constituents.

There are meaningful divisions in the world

The conclusion of Buddhism that there are no meaningful divisions is false

I have boundaries you have boundaries

Even if they are just conceptual, they can be meaningful

But there definitely are differences in internal experience

there also are physical boundaries

Next problem: if there are boundaries how do you make sense of that. Soul?

Where my person is is the boundary of my soul.
