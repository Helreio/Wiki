# Three types of notes in Zettelkasten

There are three types of notes in [[Zettelkasten]]:

1. [[Fleeting notes]]
   - These are notes we take on the go, with no other purpose but to capture insights and ideas. I use several [[Inboxes to capture fleeting notes]].
1. [[Evergreens]]
   - These are the meat of the note-writing system. These notes are the main reason you [[Use a note-writing system]]. They are the [[Evergreen notes]] in [[Andy Matuschak]]'s [[Evergreen note-taking system]].
   - They are always stored in the same way in the same place.
   - They need more intentionality when writing them because they have to be written in such a way that they can still be understood even after they’ve left their original context.
1. [[Project notes]]
   - These are notes that are taken during a course of a project.
   - They are kept in a folder specific to a project.
   - These notes can be discarded after the project or processed into permanent notes.

It is important to differentiate among these notes because [[Confusion over types of notes result to less productivity]].

To do

- This note might be redundant to [[Talahardin taxonomy of note types]]. Combine this with that.
