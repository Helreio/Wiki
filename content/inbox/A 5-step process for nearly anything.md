# A 5-step process for nearly anything

A 5-step process for nearly anything:

1. Explore widely. Find out what is possible.
2. Test cheaply. Run small, quick experiments. Sample things.
3. Edit ruthlessly. Focus on the best. Cut everything else.
4. Repeat what works. Donâ€™t quit on a good idea.
5. Return to 1.
