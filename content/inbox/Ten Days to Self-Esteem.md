**Evaluation of Step 1**

*3 Things I Learned*

- Being clear about my current mental state through the BDC, the BAI, and the RSAT was really helpful.
- Clarifying my personal goals for this program and my Depression Alleviation Project in general was really helpful.
- As usual, I am deeply inspired by the reminder that helping myself is one of the biggest indicators of progress and recovery in depression as well as taking full responsibility on my recovery and not blaming or relying on others (although the help of others is definitely needed).

*3 Things I Didn’t Like*

- I noticed that the BDC in this book is different from the latest edition of “Feeling Good” so I used the latest edition to diagnose my current level of depression. I think this book needs to be updated.
- I also notice that a lot of the things mentioned in this book was also present in Feeling Good. I do understand. But that critical part in me tells me “Is this one of those books that just copy-paste what was written in their predecessors?” The compassionate and original parts of the book were enough though to convince me that the books is different.
- The BAI needs to be updated to be more culturally sensitive.

*3 Things I Did Like*

- I’m like talking with a real psychotherapist when reading this book. I like it. It’s amazing.
- Doing the exercises in self-help books is honestly one of the things that I’ve been avoiding consistently. Unlike the other self-help books I read, Dr. Burns repeatedly explained why doing the exercises is essential. I think I’ll be more motivated to do exercises on self-help books that I read now.
- I so love the anecdote that Dr. Burns used to explain why patience and perseverance is needed to achieve happiness and self-esteem. I never knew that his condition existed and I admire him for practicing what he teaches.

# Step 2 - You Feel The Way You Think

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056838,120.453687)

*Picture in your mind’s eye a time when you felt sad and discouraged or worried or angry. It may have been recently or at any time in your life. Describe what happened to you here. Try to be specific: Who were you with? What happened? When was it? Where were you?*

I was alone. I just arrived from Baguio and I saw that my neighbor is burning garbage again. I went upstairs and looked outside. People from the farm are also burning garbages. I smelled burning plastic. This just happened a while ago at home.

*Now describe how you felt.*

1. Mad
2. Irritated
3. Ticked off

**Your Thoughts and Your Feelings**

**Emotion**

**Describe the Events That Trigger This Emotion**

**What Kinds of Thoughts Lead to This Emotion?**

Sadness or Depression

My parents don’t talk to be about the things that interest me.

My parents don’t talk to me and support me because I am no longer a JW. My parents feel that I am already cured of depression so they no longer care about what happens to me.

Guilt or Shame

I realized that I am turning 25 and I don’t have a clear career path.

I find it difficult to talk to people about what I do. I am dependent to my parents.

Frustration

It’s been a year in Sta. Maria. Neighbors and people around keep on burning their garbages. People on the streets are arrogant when I ride my bicycle.

I want to get out of this place. But where will I go? If I go to Baguio, the environment is good but I don’t have a job there and my history is there. If I go to Manila, I might give up after a few months because of pollution etc.

Anger

I see the smoke coming out of my neighbor’s burned garbage. He doesn’t throw water at the garbage and the smell of burned plastic fills the [air.My](http://air.My) neighbors are insensitive. They only think about themselves. They intentionally burn their garbages with disregard of their neighbor’s health.

Anxiety, Worry, Fear, or Panic

I realized that I am turning 25 and I don’t have a thriving freelance business. I also don’t have a stable full-time job. My finances are in shambles.

I’ll never have enough money when I am old and I need to retire. If ever I need a full-time job, employers won’t get me because I am already old.

Loneliness

I’ve been spending most of my days alone at home for more than two weeks.

I don’t have a social life. I am a poor socializer. I left the church and now I don’t have any friends. My parents don’t talk to me. My girlfriend don’t understand me.

Hopelessness or Discouragement

The Bookbright projects were cancelled.Two of my main gigs ended this year. Now I’m back to looking for new jobs. I feel like I always have to do this. And I can’t build a freelance practice correctly because I don’t have the proper people skills. I am meant to be a dumb employee.

**Tyrone’s Daily Mood Log**

**Negative Thoughts**

Write down the thoughts that make you upset

**Distortions**

Use the Distorted Thinking chart on page 50.

**Positive Thoughts**

Substitute thoughts that are more positive and realistic

1. I am a born loser.
1. All-or-nothing thinking, mental filter, discounting the positive, magnification, emotional reasoning, “should” statements, labeling, blame“I’m a human being who’s out of work. Lots of people are in my predicament these days. I lost my job, and that’s a pain in the ass, but it doesn’t make me a loser. Several of my buddies are out of work, and they’re not losers."
2. I’ll never get another job.
2. All-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, Jumping to conclusions

That’s impossible. Almost every week, job boards are being filled. There are lots of chances to get hired. Even if I don’t get another job, it’s not the end of the world. I can live sustainably on less or I can ask help from friends and family. I have significant experiences that can help me land another job.

3. I’m letting my family down.

Jumping to conclusions, Blame

That’s not true. I’m just thinking this. My family is not a bunch of dependents. My wife is a highly reliable and intelligent woman as capable of earning income as I am. She can help me and the family go through this period as I look for a new job.

**Daily Mood Log Exercise 2**

**Negative Thoughts**

**Distortions**

**Positive Thoughts**

1. I won't understand the game. 100%

MF, JC(F)

That’s not true. I’ve played cards in the past. Of course, it will be difficult at first and Jerry knows this. He will teach me the game and will be patient as I try to go around it. After a few rounds I’ll be more equipped to at least be a good competitor. I don’t need to win. I just have to learn the game and have fun along the process.

1. Jerry will think I’m stupid. 100%

JC(M), L

I don’t know that. I can’t read Jerry’s mind. And even if I can, I don’t think Jerry is that kind of a person. That’s just rude and my friends are not like that.

1. Then he won't like me. 100%

JC(M)

Of course that’s not true. A game of cards won’t determine Jerry not liking me. The mere fact he invited me to play means he likes me and if I try my best to just have fun even if I don’t understand the game entirely, he will feel at home, at peace, and at fun with me. He’ll like me more after this game! I have to go then.

1. This means I’m no good. 100%

O, MAG, LThat’s not true. A game of cards does not determine whether I am good or bad. What does good even mean? I’m good in many other things, much larger and worthier than a game of cards.

**Evaluation of Step 3**

*What did you learn in Step 3? Put a brief summary of several of the most important ideas we discussed here:*

1. The difference between healthy and unhealthy feelings.
2. 3 options in dealing with healthy feelings (accept, express, and act).
3. How to deal with unhealthy feelings: change the thoughts that caused them.
4. The uses of the “Emotion Cost-Benefit Analysis.”
5. Use the “Daily Mood Log” to change negative thoughts at least 10-15 minutes per day
6. To be helpful to you, a Positive Thought must have two characteristics:
- It must be 100% true, or nearly 100% true.
- It must reduce your belief in the NT.
7. The Trouble Shoot Guide

*Was there anything in today’s step that bothered you or rubbed you the wrong way? Describe any negative feelings you had:*

None really.

*Was there anything in today’s step that was particularly helpful, interesting, or useful? Describe any positive reactions you had:*

The point on differentiating healthy and unhealthy feelings. It’s good to point out that we need to express healthy feelings like healthy anger in the right way. We have several options to do this. This is important for me because I had a lot of anger issues in the past.
