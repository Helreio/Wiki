# Alain de Botton’s minimum requirements for a relationship

For [[Alain de Botton]], it is okay to set expectations for a potential romantic partner. However, for him, a line should be drawn between "enough" and “too much” expectations (like those advocated by [[Susan Elliot]]. If there is too much expectations, no one will fit the bill. For Alain, we should find it enough to have at least three things in a relationship:

1. Kindness
2. Vulnerability
3. Understanding

A bond between two people is fulfilling precisely because it is not played out in all practical details of existence.
