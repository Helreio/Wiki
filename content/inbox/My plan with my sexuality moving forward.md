# My plan with my sexuality moving forward

New things I realized.

- I acknowledge that this kink is the strongest trigger of arousal for me. It is almost only the porn I watch and if I don’t think about it, I can’t perform well in bed.
- What we did was last Sunday was a mistake. Why?
   - I hurt myself.
      - My feelings are similar to when I was cheated on but mild. I feel the same things: regret, jealousy, anxiety, losing confidence,
         - I am only able to feel better just a while ago because: (1) I got to spend more time really thinking about this a while ago, (2) I was also able to send messages to people and forums. One promised to return my email. Looking forward to it. I got replies to my emails too.
   - We did it out of surge of emotions and with very little knowledge.
   - I agreed to it even if I was not a 100% sure I want this really. I haven’t done enough inner work.
   - We did it the wrong way.
      - We showed your face. We didn’t protect your privacy enough.
      - We jumped right into actual sex. We could have taken a slower and more careful trajectory: sex toys, sexting, video call, real-life (if ever)
      - We did it with the wrong person. We didn’t choose well and carefully.
      - We didn’t set boundaries.
         - I was bothered by you taking a shower with him and you licking his ass and you suddently wanting to get your pussy licked when you didn’t want it before.
      - I did a huge mistake of not being there and of the video being too incomplete. So I missed it all. It feels like I wasn't part of the experiment really.

I am not yet ready to live that lifestyle. I am not even sure I want it.

- I am not sure I want it.
   - It requires opening up to people. I am extemely introverted. I am not sure I want too many people in my life.
   - I feel hurt sharing you in real life. I feel jealousy, regret, and anxiety. I don’t know if I really want that much stress. Cuckolds desire all of those negative emotions. I don’t enjoy them.
- I need to do a lot of unpacking in terms of my sexuality.
   - I am able to control my emotions relatively well, but I have neglected dealing with my sexual thoughts and emotions.
   - I have about 19 years of sexual repression inside the church. For example, I am reluctant to share you even if it gives me pleasure. I am not used to it.
   - Even after I left the church, I wasn’t really able to explore my sexuality as I jumped right into a long-term relationship. I met very few women.
   - The breakup from three years before still have some effect on my subconscious, affecting my self-confidence. My mind is still associating the thought “My gf got fucked by someone else” with that past trauma.
   - I have years of conditioning through watching the wrong kinds of porn.
- If ever I enter that lifestyle, I want to do it when I already know what I want, I have a stronger handle of my sexuality, and I have built more self-confidence.

What will we do moving forward?

- Let’s close this mini-experiment.
   - I will no longer push you to contact the people you had affairs in the past. These people are associated with negative emotions with your lonely past. Let’s not get back to those baggages. If we are going to do this, we are going to do it with the right people. (Consider blocking Seb or Genard. They might get back.)
   - We will delete your telegram to protect both of our privacies. If ever we go back, we will do it very privately.
   - Let’s not make it a topic for joke.
- I will spend more time truly understanding and explore my sexuality.
- I want us to strengthen our sexual relatioship together by exploring kinks within this exclusivity.
   - We can still use this as a fantasy.
   - We can try using toys to simulate it.
- I am still open to the possibility in the future when we are truly ready. But I am also open to the possibility of totally closing this. Will you be okay about that?
- If ever we go back, we will start with a clean slate and do it correctly.

Finally, my request to you:

- I will repeatedly go back to you expressing my negative feelings. I am very vulnerable right now. Please understand me. Don't get annoyed. Just repeatedly console me and assure me of your love.
