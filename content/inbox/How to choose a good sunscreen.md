# How to choose a good sunscreen

Choosing a good sunscreen to use is an important step in [[Basic skin care]]. A good sunscreen protects you from both UVA and UVB rays.

UVA and UVB are the two types of UV or ultraviolet rays. To know the difference between the two, see [[UVA vs UVB]].

In a sunscreen, the SPF rating is the level of protection that counteracts UVB. When buying a sunscreen, you need one with an SPF rating that is not less than SPF30. One that has an SPF rating of SPF100 is the best.

Meanwhile, the PA rating of a sunscreen is the level of protection against UVA. Buy a sunscreen with a PA rating of PA+++ or broad spectrum.

Here are the [[Best sunscreens in the Philippines for oily skins]].
