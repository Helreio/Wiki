Self is an experience being observed

Spiritual path is all about defining your self. What are u?

If I am not my body, what do I need it for?

No experience = No self

Watcher = ego 1

- still an object

Enlightenment is not experience, like death, it is a realization

Enlightenment cant happen to you. The personality who wants it to happen cant have it

Connected to people, hav relationahips better than living in isolation

Instead of you watching the movie. Your attention goes to thw fact that you are sitting down, watching a movie

Layers of experience

1. Define yourself. What are you?
2. See clearly. Reverse the object of your attention.
3. Watch the watcher. Cultivate the doubt sensation.
4. Take action. Challenge yourself.
5. Be wary of thought.
6. Make a commitment to keep it.
7. Daily examination of conscience.
8. Pray.
9. Help others.
