# Kelly Wearstler teaches interior design

Whatever the senses see, you create a story. Make it unfold in the best possible way.

What is the story behind your interior design?

Good design helps us feel better.

- If we look good, we feel good.
- If things are functional, we perform better.
- Functionality + Good design = Great experience

Every single detail matters.

Our home is a reflection of who we are.

Everything at home is an experience. You want to make it the best you can.

Focus on the areas you spend the most of your time (in my case, that’s my office).

The areas you spend the most of your time in should make you feel happy and brighten your every day life.

# Source of inspiration

## Find what you love

Just start collecting things that attract you and that inspire emotion.

## Fashion as inspiration

## Travel as inspiration

Where are the best vintage stores?

Look for the best places in your town to find inspiration.

Design is everywhere. You just have to be aware.

# Starting a project

What is in your mind’s eye?

How do you want to live in this space?

How do you want to experience this space?

Put up a program

- a list of requirements

What are the things that you enjoy?

How do you want to live?

What is important to you?

Go online and do some research.

Write a list of requirement

## Explore your location

Do some research about the house.

- Who was the architect?
- What are the types of windows and doors?
- Go into every room of the house.
- What is outside the window?
- How large is the window?
- How much light does the space get?
- Use materials based on the weather of the environment.

# Working with space

## Design a space like a boat

Consider every inch.

Make use of every space.

## Play with visual trickery

Mirror has the power to enlarge a space.

If you want more space, buy three mirrors and put them together in one wall and that transforms the room.

## Embrace awkward spaces

## Give it a new spirit

When customizing interior architecture, two things are important:

- Craftsmanship
- Prototype

In your own space, take something and give it a new spirit—modernizing it.

## Identify key architectural features

Look at what is outside, what people will be looking out from your space. Use that as inspiration to decide how to design the interior.

For old houses, if there are historical details stripped away, you can return to them.

# Field trip: Working with space

Your story could start from the exterior then continues to the interior.

Walk around the space and document details (anything that moves you emotionally).

Details should speak to each other.

# Materiality in design

Organize a project using trays. One tray per room.

Let the tray evolve. Be flexible.

Mix metals.

## Materials are dynamic

Stone

- Mother nature
- Sometimes it is quiet, sometimes it is active

If you want to see how a material really behaves, put it on a wall and step back, then observe.

Consider the texture, the hand, of a material

## Problem-solving

When designing, determine hierarchy. Which is the most important element? The second? The third?

## Take risks

## Alternatives to high-end materials

Plaster

Wall covering

Paint
