Every day, I will aspire to have 4 hours of good deep work.

Ideally, 7- 11 am.

But if that is not possible, 8-12 nn.

These 4 good hours will consist of tasks that I "absolutely have to do". These are:

- Meditation
- 5MJ
- Morning pages
- Talakahon
- Thoreau translation
- Read a book and take notes

After these 4 good hours, I am free to do whatever I like, in this order:

1. Do one of my projects that is calling me.
2. Play video games.
3. Walk.
4. Watch series.
