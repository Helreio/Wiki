# David Sedaris: Storytelling and Humor

## Introduction

Writers are fortunate because they can write about serious stuff and eventually make them funny.

### Quote people, exaggerate, and insult yourself

### Your life is worth writing about

Take a step back and look for what can be written about.

It’s not about what happened to your life it’s about how you write about it.

## Observing the World

Sometimes your life feels like a story.
* “Laugh, Kookaburra” (The New Yorker, August 24, 2009)
* “Understanding Owls” (The New Yorker, October 22, 2012)
* “Leviathan” (The New Yorker, January 5, 2015)

You need to be tuned in, but your subject sometimes just comes to you.

### Ask better questions

Exploit everyone you come into contact with.

You can talk to strangers, it doesn’t have to be small talk. Take charge of the conversation.

Questions David asked
* Have you ever been to Athens, Greece to feed yogurt to stray cats?"

### Say ‘yes' to weird experiences

Lypoma

Do something you normally won’t do.

“If I live, I can always write about it.”

### Don’t ruin the moment

When a story is happening to you, don’t stop it, don’t ruin it. Just let it play out.

“Picka Pocketoni” (Me Talk Pretty One Day)

### Let people expose their true selves

Love it when people think the complete opposite of who you really are.

It’s like you have special glasses that help you see what people are really like.

## Turning Observations Into Stories

David’s routine
* Writes on diary.
* Writes on an essay from 10-1:30.
* Goin on a walk to pick up garbage in the afternoon to 8 pm.
* Seats on his desk for another hour and work some more.
* Dinner.
* Sometimes goes back to work after dinner.

Write every single day.

### Mine Your Diary

Vignette - incident

Open the entry, write it all over again and see where it might take you.

## Breaking Into a Story

Needing to be perfect is a real curse.

You need to do the best that you can do and then you need to take the best that you can do, and rewrite it.

Feeling the need to be perfect doesn’t make you perfect. It just makes you paralyzed. So let go of that because you’re not going to be perfect. And if you’re very lucky, you’ll learn to be yourself.

### Find a Way In

Things you need to unlearn
* Have a topic sentence.
* Let’s get to the story.
Your opening is gonna determine your entire essay.

Transitioning from the first sentence to the next could take days or weeks.

Insisting something that you and the reader have something in common, but that thing is ridiculous.

### Connect Incidents to Something Bigger

People get wrong about you all the time so it’s amazing when people get you right.

## Connecting to Your Reader

You need to connect to readers because they won't read another thing from.

People want a mirror. They want to see themselves in a book.

### Don't build an essay around a laugh

Constantly ask yourself, what can you cut? What can go?

Don't salvage a laugh. If it has to go, let it go or use it somewhere else.

### Notice your reactions

If your reaction to something is selfish, just admit it. It will make you more relatable.

### You can't control the reader's perception

You can connect with them in other things.

How do you draw a line between being honest when it will alienate other people?
* That's beyond your control.

The difference between writing and speaking is that writing gives you the illusion that you're in control. But it's just an illusion.

Let go of that illusion of control.
* You don't want to be defensive or over-explaining your position.

### Laugh at Yourself

If you are writing humor, then you have to harder on yourself than you are on everyone else. People tend to forgive you if you're making fun of yourself before they even get the chance to say it. Be genuine about it.

You can't write humor and not be able to laugh at it yourself. It's not fair.

### Don't Pander

Read what you wrote in front of an audience.

Your audience are different but at the same time there is a single persona that can unify all of them.

## Writing About Loved Ones

Diaries can help you win arguments.

David always writes everything he gives everyone in Christmas and how much they cost. He also writes how what they give him.

### Celebrate Your Subjects

It's a balancing act when you write about a person. Everyone has their secrets. You don't want to expose those secrets.

When David writes about his family, he gives it to them first and asks them if there's anything they want to change or get rid of.

When you write about people you know, you are trying to celebrate them.

Be careful that you flatter someone before you reveal their flaw.

### Celebrating Subjects: David's Sister Lisa

“You Can’t Kill the Rooster” in Me Talk Pretty One Day

Send a copy of the story to family before publishing them.

Friends and family can get a little conscious talking to us if they know we’re going to write about them.

“The Spirit World”

Relationships are complicated, and it’s hard to write about something that is complicated.

“Me Talk Pretty One Day” Esquire, March 1999

It’s easier to write about people you are fond of.

I only write about people I don’t like when they’re dead.

# Story Evolution: "Active Shooter"

David’s writing process

1. It begins with a small notebook. He uses it to capture everything.
2. He then uses these notes to write in his diary.
3. When he goes on a lecture tour, he starts with four essays.
4. He reads something outloud, then go back and rewrite it. He notes where the audience laughs.
5. When the audience coughs, it means something is wrong.

Do not delete drafts. Make multiple drafts.

## Give an audience a release

When reading to an audience about difficult topics, use laughter to release tension.

Look at your essay and study its overall lay. Where do you need to release tension and make laugh?

Where are blocks of information that makes the audience feel like they are being lectured to?

- Chop that block and move it to different places so readers won’t feel like they’re being lectured to.

# Kitchen Sink Stories: Live in Cleveland

Take different incidents and piece them together into one story.

# Ending With Weight

Sorrow gives more weight to the humor and makes it more memorable. But don’t be formulaic about it.

Don’t force it.

## Turn the end around

Wopie Goldberg had a profound influence on David.

Try to create laughter that becomes something else—a joke that turns a finger back at you.

The danger is writing something that stops instead of something that ends. You should be able to make your audience make a noise at the end, like being kicked by a baby. The ending should do some physical damage on you.

## Workshop the Ending

Since there is no prescribed ending to your life, endings are just made of air and words.

If your ending doesn’t work, you may have made a wrong turn somewhere. To correct that, go back three pages, throw everything away, and take a different direction.

## “The Spirit World” end with truth

“The Spirit World” first appeared in The Paris Review in 2017, with the title “Letter From Emerald Isle.”

Take an essay and ask yoursefl, “what if I dug deeper here?” What if I sacrificed my laugh? Instead of a laugh here, I say or admit to what I really felt. This makes it a better essay.

It’s not pretty. But it is not your job to be pretty all the time.

# Revision Philosophy

It’s a good exercise to write something two pages long and has an ending.

“If I can’t read it on stage, I don’t see the point writing it.”

He doesn’t write 20-page essays because he can’t read that on stage.

People turn David’s books not because they’re a page-turner but because they’re 12 pages long. People say, “might as well”

## Give your editor draft #20

Rewrite 60 times.

Writing is rewriting.

Sometimes, something is not worth rewriting. That’s fine, because not everything is worth going back to.

David rewrites something 12-18 times before he gives it to his editor.

Learn as much as you can on your own, then turn to your editor.

## Turn references into descriptions

Sometimes a laugh can come just by stepping back and describing something in a cold way.

Avoid pop culture references, because they get lost in translation.

## Dig for the truth

Read your essay over to identify where you need to dig deeper.

Truth is different from feelings.

You don’t want to emote. You want to create a moment that connects all of us.

## Don't overcrowd the story

Your reader can only hold so many characters in their head. We don’t need to know everyone in the story. It’s hurting your story to mention unnecessary names.

You can’t overwhelm your reader/listener.

## Protect your laughs

Fight for your jokes.

“April & Paris” (The New Yorker, March 24, 2008)

# Growing as a Writer

So much of what David knows he learned from going to people’s readings and taking part in people’s readings.

Don’t read lots of pages.

Don’t setup or provide an intro to what you are going to read.

Don’t stop reading whatever interruption happens around you.

## Keep writing new material

Nobody publishes books without a dream.

David doesn’t want to be the person who reads something and it works and he drags it around.

Read Ann Patchett’s essay on writing “The Getaway Car”

- When you're young, your job is to stack up the pages—write something, learn from it, write something new.

## Stay grateful

Show genuine gestures of care to your readers.

Tobias Wolf, probably the best short story writer in America.

## Trust that people with help you

People like helping other people. Allow them to help you.

You don’t go to people and sell your work. That never works.

Be generous. Be interested in other people’s writings. Give specific feedback. Celebrate other people and their accomplishments.

# David's Influences

There is no such thing as a folk writer. You can’t write unless you read.

## Read writers who make it seem possible

Read Babbit by Sinclair Lewis.

He just read the books you are supposed to read at school.

When he finds a book he likes, he looked at who blurbed the book, and read their books.

Raymond Carver

- His sentences were very simple and short.
- He is a person you can read and say to yourself, I can do this.
- No semi-colons.
- He wrote about people as if you, the reader, knows those people.

When you are just starting out, read someone who makes writing seem possible.

Imitate other writers.

# Conclusion: Two Groups of People

## There's a spot waiting for you

Develop discipline for writing. Set a time and sit down and write.

Writing letters count as writing. Writing emails doesn’t.

As long as you keep the habit of writing and reading, you’ll get better at it.

Don’t confuse writing from publishing.

It’s not your job to get published. Let the world take care of that.

David wrote everyday for 15 years before his first book came out.

David throws about a third of what he writes. That’s normal.

Not everyday is going to be a great day at your desk.

Get to work NOW.

David announced to himself that he wanted to be a writer, and he was already writing for five years at that point.

David thinks if he was able to do it, anyone can do it, because he isn’t as talented as others.

You are lucky enough just by being interested in writing.

There are two groups of people:

1. Those who pay someone to listen to their problems.
2. Those who get paid for telling people their problems.
