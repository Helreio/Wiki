# Coming Around Platonism Notes

Concrete things exist.

There is a physical realm.

There is a mental realm.

Abstract things exist.

There is an abstract realm.

Abstract things exist separate from individual minds.

- Not all abstract things are situated in minds.

Objects of diffrent ontological categories could interact with each other.

Abstract things don’t take up space.

Because abstract things don’t take up space, we need to understand them without observing them.

Abstract things inlcude the following:

- patterns
- connections
- relations

Any metaphysical theory needs to explain the existence of objects *and* their behavior across time.

Relations are essential to explaining the behavior of objects.

There are individual objects and concrete things, and there are relations among them.

The relations between objects are abstract.

These abstract relationships are independent from our minds.

Concrete objects are not isolated from one another. Their states affect each other, thus forming relationships.

Relationships between concrete objects have a separate and real metaphysical existence.

The existence of relationships is needed to explain the behavior of individual objects across time.

Fundamental building blocks of the physical world exist.

These fundamental building blocks combine into larger objects.

The behavior of these fundamental building blocks are different when they are alone and when they are with others.

The unification of these fundamental building blocks is not just done by the mind. It is also done by the universe.

The fundamental units of matter are interrelated.

There are fundamental, indivisible units at the botom of everything.

The physical world is simply different arrangements of these fundamental, indivisible units.

Space is identical with the fundamental units of matter. They are fundamental units of space. They do not occupy space. They are space.

All physical things are units of geometric space arranged in particular states.

- E.g., an extremely fine resolution Minecraft world.
- Indivisible blocks form all structures.

Some unification of geometric space are purely conceptual, i.e., they are created by the human mind, e.g., constellations.

The real-world behavior of composite objects implies that *the universe unifies parts into wholes, too*. Abstract relationships are not all created by the mind; some of them are discovered in the universe.

The universe, not our minds, seem to unify units of geometric spaces into a thing whose behavior is different than if they are isolated.

- e.g., When a spring is compressed, it does not fracture into isolated units of geometric spaces. They behave according to their relationship with other atoms. The universe, not our minds, seem to unify the units using abstract relationships that exist independent from our minds and does not take up physical space.

Groups of people (like families and nations) behave like composite objects. The state of an individual is affected by the state of others. The behavior or a single individual will be entirely different than when it is not in relation with others.

The universe is a relational system.

A composite object cannot be described by its number of of indivisible units. That’s not enough. A complete description requires its number of indivisible units AND its arrangement.

my fingers and thumb *do* appear related. The states of my fingers affect the state of my thumb. There are a large bundle of relations between them, such that the universe outputs their behavior as a composite object I label “my hand.” My hand shares many further relations with my arm, which shares relations with the rest of my body. The universe treats the parts of my body as *tightly bundled* and not isolated from each other. Hence, my body also qualifies as a composite object.

Matter and form are different. Matter are the indivisible units, while form is the arrangement of these indivisible units.

Form is a bundle of abstract relations.

Forms are something in addition to matter. Forms are a unique, relevant feature of the universe. If indivisible units are arranged in different forms, they behave differently.

*the* difference between physical objects is precisely their atomic arrangement. Geometric structures are the fundamental objects of the physical world.

Units of matter behave differently when in different arrangements because that is just how the universe works.

Physics is, then, the study of exactly which geometric structures yield which behaviors.

It’s as if the universe says, “When atoms are arranged this way, then render out this state, and when atoms are arranged that way, render out that state.”

Objects in the universe are not in a state of radical metaphysical independence.

Notice that “relative position” and “relative arrangement” are not themselves concrete objects. They aren’t atoms; they aren’t composed of atoms. They don’t weigh anything or look like anything. They are abstract. Yet, since they seem to be an integral part of the universe’s operation, I think they are both abstract *and* mind-independent – a metaphysical status I’m calling “Platonic.”

The theory of indirect interaction explains how the human mind interacts with Platonic forms.

There are cases where our conceptual criteria matches the abstract form of the universe.

universal criteria is like computer code which says, “If criteria A is met, then output state B.”

This is how form can exist completely separate from physical objects. The code can still exist even if there are no corresponding physical objects.

Example: Dinosaurs

- A dinosaur is a particular structure and pattern of indivisible units across time.
- Currently, there are no dinosaurs. This means that the “dinosaur program” isn’t currently running.
- But if suddently dinosaurs existed, that means that even if the dinosaurs did not exist for a very long time, the code for them still existed.
- Dinosaur-ness is that part of the universe’s code which determines when some arrangement of atoms is to behave like a dinosaur. Notably, there don’t need to be any actual dinosaurs in order for this Platonic form to exist.
- Anti-Platonism would imply that the universe could no longer produce dinosaurs. So, even if atoms were arranged exactly like they were back when dinosaurs existed, those atoms wouldn’t act like dinosaurs.
- Even if all dinosaurs go extinct, the code for dinosaurs would still remain.

Example: 3D printing

- There is a clear difference between a computer file which contains information about how to build a physical object, and the physical object itself. The file is just a bunch of 1’s and 0’s *in a particular arrangement.*
- You won’t find a physical object inside the code. And yet, it contains enough abstract information to be able to construct a physical object. Like Platonic forms, the code exists separately from any printed structures. Even if the code is *never* *instantiated into a physical object*, the abstract information – the form, the structure, the pattern – still exists.

Special Composition Problem

- Supposed fundamental units do get unified into composite objects, exactly when and in what circumstances does this unification occur?
- Resolution:
   - new objects are composed *whenever the universe treats fundamental parts as interrelated*. It’s precisely *the universe* doing this unification, not our minds, which means we don’t know beforehand exactly what structures will yield unique behavior. I can’t tell you a simple rule. It’s a matter of empirical inquiry. Whether X and Y are related is not discovered by examining X or Y in isolation. X and Y’s state-changes are observed together across time to see if there are discoverable patterns.

Mind-independent relationships are discoverable in the universe. Relationships are abstract, which means they are not concrete or physical.

Abstract things are either mental or Platonic.

Some of our mental concepts correspond to abstract things in the Platonic realm. They could be exactly similar, although they have different metaphysical existence.

Within the framework of divine conceptualism, mental things can be mind-independent in the form of abstract things. The things we call abstract things in platonism are still called mental things in divine conceptualism although they do not exist in human minds but could exist in the mind of God.

In divine conceptualism, God does not have to be a persona. We can simply reference the mind of God as “all the human-mind-independent abstract things”.

It is the mind of God that glues individuals into groups.

Alternatively, we can simply drop divine conceptualism and agree with just Platonism: that abstract things are non-physical and non-mental. They have their own unique ontological realm: the real of Forms.

Information and the laws of physics reside in the platonic realm.

The problem with the platonic realm is because it is in an entirely different realm that we don’t have access to, we can’t make full sense of it. If we can understand it clearly and directly, then it is mental and not platonic.
