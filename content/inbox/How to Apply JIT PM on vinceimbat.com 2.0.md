# How to Apply JIT PM on vinceimbat.com 2.0

Plunge in with exploratory actions, instead of trying to predict what will happen in advance.

There is too much uncertainty and things change fast in the world, take action rather than meticulously plan in advance.

Use PKM to manage your attention.

1. For future: Use it to curate a well-selected personal knowledge base that you can deploy to any projects in the future.
2. For now: Your only goal is to create an intermediate packet and show it to someone.

Fragment your work into tiny pieces distributed through time and space

Your day-to-day routine involves creating your personal knowledge base (your second brain). Do this by:

1. Structuring your work as a series of intermediate packets.

Make the iron triangle of your projects flexible.

Use intermediate packets to test your assumptions about your audience’s needs.

Put gathering + planning + implementing into one interwoven thread by prioritizing interacting with information over consuming it.

Think yourself as a knowledge manager who manages your own knowledge, other people, communities and organizations, and software to create what needs to be created at any given time.

PROCESS

General Plan for my Writing Career

Don’t do:

- Predicting what will happen
- Creating structures instead of letting it emerge
- Set structure, features, and purpose immediately. Just launch an MVP and experiment.

Do:

- Focus on the critical path first (research, testing, and discovery)
- Prioritize important tasks over urgent ones.
- Set a deadline. Use the bulk of the time researching, testing, and discovering. Then only create and launch something at the last minute.

Build your second brain.

Collect things (ideas, theories, possibilities, options, features, questions) and only later choose the appropriate structure based on the patterns that emerge from the material.

1. Read and collect ideas.
2. Summarize what I read.
3. Tweet an idea triggered by what I read (to get immediate feedback).
4. Write a blog post and publish (to get immediate feedback).

Regularly publish on any topic that interests me, with no overarching strategy or philosophy.

Instead of being very strategic about your work, get as many projects as you can then just complete tasks after tasks.

Think of yourself as a project portfolio manager.

- Choose the right projects to start (good inputs)
- Maximize project completions (good outputs)

General Tools/Setup

- Clearly summarized packets of knowledge (through Progressive Summarization).
- These packets are then organized to actionability (PARA).
- Combine these packets into valuable deliverables right at the moment they’re needed.
- Have the 16 workflow strategies on hand to use when needed

Project Planning

Break down the big project into intermediate packets to make sure that you generate small wins.

Use the following criteria for good packets:

- Answer questions or test assumptions.
- Need to be done anyway
- Simplify or speed up future projects
- Make future decisions faster or easier

Make the iron triangle of the project (time, scope, budget) flexible.

Use the beginning of the project (your first intermediate packets) for ideation, experimentation, and drawing on other disciplines.

Schedule the project’s deadline.

Schedule the schedule for deciding, combining, and producing at a very near date to launch, as late as possible.

Schedule regular reflection on the project to extract clear feedback from your experiments.

Set new actions based on this feedback.

Choosing what to work on

Always have multiple projects to work on.

Allot your deep focus on

- projects that expand how many CUs you have available (i.e. establishing a repeatable process)
- projects that take CUs to build but not to maintain
- the most unique and valuable work you can do

Allot your mild and light focus on:

- projects that improve the quality of our CUs (i.e. meal planning or exercising)

Choose the task at hand based on your emotional state.

- Assign tasks based on your specific emotional state attached to a time of the day

Project Management

Start a work session by choosing one intermediate packet/deliverable to work on.

End your work session with a clear deliverable.

At the end of a work session on every project, create a placeholder to freeze your project and know what to do on the next session.

Send your deliverable off for feedback.

Always make sure that you have wins in every work session you enter into.
