I am damaged with what you did to me. I feel like I've had enough emotional turmoil and then you added more. I see that it's difficult for you to empathize with me. And perhaps it is understandable given that you can't even empathize with yourself.

But it doesn't matter. I was traumatized with what you did to me. Every time I remember how you gave your body to someone else who was not me and without my knowledge, I feel torn inside. But this was about satisfying your urges really. You needed to satisfy them and you can't make good judgment because of them. You don't have control over your emotions and thoughts. And because of that you hurt me.

I do know that I deserve better than what you gave me. I know it isn't right to get back and look for you. But I also know that it is wrong to deny the pain I am feeling, the silent pain that I am feeling because of what you did.

When I got depressed in 2011, I blamed people, many of them. And my behavior was destructive not just to myself but to others as well.

It's a challenge to live. I still feel that. But one thing is for sure, I will not give up without a fight. I am more capable now to contend with my demons. I am more rational. More mature.

I can get past what you did to me.

I will get past what you did to me.
