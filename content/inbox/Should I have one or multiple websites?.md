# Should I have one or multiple websites?

A hub of all my work.

- Link to business website.
- Link to blog where I explore writing in Pangasinan
- Link to Tagalog blog (philosophy, poetry, rational mysticism)
- Link to English blog
- Link to a blog where I write in all

[[Mantaltaliwa]] deserves to have its own container because it is part of its goal to give Pangasinan its own voice.

This problem is also related to the following problems:

- [[Should I write in one language or multiple languages?]]
- [[thoughts/should I engage a local or international audience]]
