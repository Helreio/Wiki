# Learning how to read

There are three kinds of texts

1. Poetic
2. Narrative
3. Theoretical

We read narratives by using information already revealed to us in navigating a story with elements that are still unknown.

On the other hand, we read poems by being observant and relying on short-term memory to understand a text using subtle elements like vocabulary, syntax, rhythm, etc. and realizing that despite this, there is still no way we can really be sure about the meaning of the text.

Theoretical texts that are used in everyday language must be reas differently from poems and stories.

Randomness plays a large role in writing theoretical texts. A text could have been written differently had it been written on a different day.

Most words in a theoretical text cannot be conceptually regulated. Only a small part of a theoretical text is truly conceptually valuable.

Much of theoretical writing depends on incidental occurences despite careful theoretical work.

Theoretical texts require both short-term and long-term memory to distinghish what is essential from nonessential and new from repeated.

When reading theoretical texts, one must read selectively and extract extensively networked references.

Perhaps the best method would be to take notes—not excerpts, but condensed reformulations of what has been read. The re-description of what has already been described leads almost automatically to a training of paying attention to “frames,” or schemata of observation, or even to noticing conditions which lead the text to offer some descriptions but not others. What is not meant, what is excluded when something is asserted?
