# Some thoughts on insurance

Insurance only makes sense if a loss is irecoverable. If a potential loss can be recovered, then it makes no sense to have insurance on that particular thing. An alternative to insurance is proactively lessening one’s risk for certain conditions. Another is community—being a part of an interdependency that looks out for each other unconditionally.

The emotion that gave birth to insurance is fear of the future. This is the same emotion that gave birth to birthing protocols like requiring a mother to not eat for an extended period of time before giving birth. They do this as an “insurance” in case a mother needs to be cesarianed.

An insurance is a psychological tool for most people especially because most people do not live in the moment. But one can argue that if living in the moment is the goal, aren’t we in fact helping people to live in the momment by insuring them? I think a criticism of insurance is okay but a complete rejection of it only makes sense if one is really intent in abandoning or distancing from the money economy.

If one believes on the necessity of the money economy, the insurance makes sense up to some extent. It does become unnecessary in some situations. Here, the criticism is about efficiency.

Here is a balanced position:

Get insurance for what is only necessary and then work on developing community as well as living in the present moment.

To go without health insurance is to go against an entire system that has engulfed even the community that I assume will help me when something wrong happens. Begging money for a health emergency destroys human dynamics. I become a burden to others. Vice versa, if I am the one asked for help, I am not sure I am ready to part ways from my money only to give to a friend in need.

The interplay between self-reliance and surrendering to a community is a difficult thing to think about. But we need both.
