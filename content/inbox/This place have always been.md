# This place have always been

a place of consolation

from heartbreak and sadness

from grief and loneliness.

In this place

poems have emerged

stories wrote themselves

philosophies have been concocted

And now, it's changing

really fast.

And as it changes

so is my heart

and my mind

and my soul.
