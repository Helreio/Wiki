# On the different human species in Mundo

The diversity of human species in my fantasy world was due to genes.

The first sons and daughters were all shap-shifters (asuang) because their ama was strong. And they were also gifted with cognitive powers (ina) and magic (anak). The first sons and daughters were the baganis of lore, godlike humanoids that had balanced capabilities (strong, wise, magical).

Intermarriages and time diluted these abilities.

Intermarriage produced species that were strongly maka-ina (those with cognitive powers but no magic), those who were able to balance ina and ama (those with strong magical abilities), and those who were strongly maka-ama (those who were shape-shifters and had strong physical abilities).

Aside from genes, environment and culture shaped individual capabilities.

Maka-ina

- Babaylan ya managkansiyon

Maka-anak

- Mages (names differ depending on what kind of magic they've learned)
- Mambabarang

Maka-ama

- Asuang (shape-shifter)
- Nibayani

All species have ina, ama, and anak calabilities.

However, genetic, cultural, and environmental changes created varieties in terms of the range of control each individual and each clan has on each element.

There are taos who have a high mastery still of the three.

Taos that have high mastery of the two.

Taos that have high mastery of one.

Taos that almost have no mastery of any.

What's true however is that taos now cannot achieve the same mastery of the anitos and baganis of lore.

Taos came from a specific form of halimaws called

- Tiyanak? (Nope. Need a halimaw that is bigger, already human-like)
- Asuang?

They were small, dark, beast-like creatures that had sophisticated societies. It is within a tiyanak society were ama and ina grew.
