# How to build a life system

**01 The Theory**

Gain a basic understanding of the building blocks of reality and human behavior.

\-    What are actions?

\-    What are projects?

\-    What are desires?

\-    What are goals?

Outputs

\-    A text that introduces the theories and concepts that form the foundation of the system.

Process

\-    Come up with an initial text

\-    Update this text as needed, when new research or facts are collected

**02 Ground Level**

Establish a ground-level productivity system.

\-    Capturing (notes, tasks, calendar events)

\-    Clarifying

\-    Organizing (personal knowledge management)

Outcome

- I am effectively capturing notes on a note-taking app, tasks in a task manager, events in a calendar app, reading materials in a read-later app, and other inputs in digital inboxes (email, desktop, downloads, etc.). I organize these inputs into a PARA system. I have a backup system that protects my data. I also have a paper filing system.

Outputs

\-    A choice of note-taking app

\-    A choice of task manager

\-    A choice of calendar app

\-    A choice of read later app

\-    Other digital inboxes (email, desktop, downloads, etc.)

\-    An initial Projects list

\-    An initial Areas list

\-    An Resources folder

\-    An Archive folder

\-    A backup system

Process

\-    Come up with initial system

\-    Update as needed

**03 Sky Level**

Get in touch with and clarify what you want.

\-    Core desired mental states

\-    Values

\-    Purpose

\-    Mission Statement

\-    Goals

Outputs

\-    A list of activities you can do to improve introspection and getting in touch with what you want

\-    A plan on how to execute these activities

\-    A list of your core desired mental states

\-    A list of your top values

\-    A well-written purpose

\-    A well-written mission statement

\-    An accomplished three-day best future self exercise

\-    A rough list of your goals

Process

\-    Come up with an initial output (one-time project)

\-    Update these outputs annually (area: Life System - Sky Level)

Outcome

- I have a text containing a list of my core desired mental states, core values, purpose, mission statement, best future self, and character strengths.

Define pathways towards what you want.

\-    Character strengths

\-    Goal-setting with some initial planning

Outputs

\-    A list of your character strengths

\-    A list of well-written goals

**04 Reviews**

Set review systems to align actions with what you want.

\-    Weekly Review

\-    Monthly Review

\-    Mid-Year Review

\-    Annual Review

Outputs

\-    A written process for doing a weekly review (including when such review could be done)

\-    A written process for doing a monthly review (including when such review could be done; usually around the first day of the month)

\-    A written process for doing an annual review (including when such review could be done; usually around the first day of the year)

Outcome

- I have a text detailing how I will conduct a Weekly Review, Monthly Review, and Annual Review. I have conducted an annual review containing a gratitude list, answers to questions about the past and coming year, and personal narrative vision for the coming year. I have also constructed a list of my areas of responsibility and their corresponding standards to be maintained, a list of my goals and the projects that correspond to them, and my routines.

**05 Project Management**

(Still in the realm of action. How you design projects to create certain ways of acting.)

Create a ‘meta plan’ with the desired outcome. Be very specific with these.

Expand each outcome into the project(s) needed to achieve it.

Define small projects.

- Break up big undertakings into little, manageable projects that you can systematically work through. If done right, this will save you from overwhelm and procrastination.

Create meta plans for each smaller project.

- Collect all sources, notes, and resources in one spot.

Arrange your projects in a logical sequence.

- What needs to come first?
- Look for dependencies upon one another.

Divide into chunks of time.

For each project, create a tiny brief that outlines:

- Who
- What
- When
- Why

(While project management still is in the realm of managing actions, personal knowledge management lies on the realm of knowledge - a form of resource we use to take action. In knowledge management, you design the organization of knowledge to support a particular outcome of action)

The goal of personal knowledge management is

- Easy encoding of information
- Easy retrieval of information
- Creative output from information saved

Subjects

- How should I plan my projects?
- How should I work through my projects?
- How does information flow through your work processes?

**07 The Life Philosophy**

Create a minimum viable life philosophy that ties what you understand about the world and what you want.

A life philosophy is simply an explanation of your actions, values, and desires using what you believe about what exists and how we know things. It is a derivative of defining all the building blocks above.

Outputs

- A short but expandable description of why you do what you do based on what you know about the world, human behavior, and yourself.

**08 The Life Manual**

Write a life manual/handbook/operating procedures that you will update.
