# Do not let emotions control you but listen to them

Totally discarding negative emotions and treating them as something useless, as does some of the stoics, is terribly wrong. Evolutionarily speaking, negative emotions have a use, otherwise, they won’t be here.

The opposite—being controlled by them—something the stoics avoided, is also wrong.

The best approach to negative emotions is to not be controlled by them but not totally discard them either. Rather, we should listen to them. This is because, negative emotions alwys tell us something important to us. For example, if we feel lonely, that means we value intimacy but don’t get it much.

Listening to our emotions requires that we detach from them first. For example, instead of saying, “I am sad,” say, “I notice that I am feeling sad.” When you detach yourslf from our emotion, you build a space between the two of you. That space is where the magic happens. You can start using reason to make good use of the negative emotions.
