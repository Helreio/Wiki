# 2021-10 Monthly report

# Summary

This month was a month of strengthening my bond with Lea and her family. The month started by me and Lea talking honestly about sexuality. Then, she, along with my friends, helped me go through flu. After this experience, I wrote a treatment plan in case I get Covid. Also, I finally got to meet Tita Remy properly in person and even joined her in Quezon, where I met Lea’s relatives. I had a really great time and I think I did a good job bonding with the people there. When we got back, I supported Lea during her hosting of the Peso Summit, with which she is very grateful. I missed my family this month, so I called Ate Mau and my parents at Pangasinan too. I also started working on my finances by creating a customized spreadsheet to make it faster for me to review my finances monthly with less errors. I also continued training Nics to become and editor. In my studies, I was able to process most major notes from Evernote and transferred them to Craft. I also discovered Montaigne via Stephen Batchelor and explored his life and work.
