# 2021-09 Monthly report

# Summary

This was a month of emotional experiences that were nurturing yet challenging at the same time. I went back home to Pangasinan to spend time with my parents and pets who I haven’t been with for eight months, and with my sister who I haven’t talked to for more than a year. I was filled with joy just being with them, but also felt difficult emotions as my parents were getting older, I am missing the dogs, and I am still awkward with my sister. I also went back to the abandoned house in Sta. Maria, which was a sad visit, but one where I really got to connect more with my father. I also celebrated an entire month of my second anniversary with Lea, which was filled with deep conversations and yet challenging emotions. I particularly enjoyed our trip to Lemery, supporting Lea with her podcast project, and talking to her about sexuality. I also made progress in my relationship with Rem, as we started exploring tough conversations bravely with open minds and hearts. In a more personal note, I grew tremendously in my understanding and practice of my zettelkasten and my life management system in general, my exploration of Covid issues particularly vaccination (finally), and my unexpected realizations on my problems with my sexuality.
