# Elaine Welteroth Teaches Designing Your Career

# Meet Your Instructor: Elaine Welterworth

Design a career that optimizes the best in you and allows you to feel fulfilled with the way that you’re spending your time.

It’s not about titles or labels. It’s about dreaming out of the box and custom designing a career path that’s as unique as you are.

Multi-hyphenate

- Renaissance person

You are in the driver seat of your life. You get to decide what to do with your time. You need to have the ability to pivot and change direction time again.

Figure out to dance with fear because it will be part of the process.

You need to be able to wear different hats.

# Uncover Your Zone of Genius

Do soul searching about your passions, gifts, and values. These will be your GPS as you move forward in life.

There are no wrong turns in your roadmap. You can change course any time.

Zone of genius is the sweet spot at the intersection of your passions, tallents, skills, and values.

- It is that which only you can do like nobody else can.
- It is as unique to you as your fingerprint.

Spend as much time in your life operating in that zone of genius.

Your zone of genius is your compass when you are lost. It is the framework that allows you to stay focused on what matters the most.

The more you do, the more opportunity comes. You need a filter for how to make decisions about what is for you and what you should say no to.

## Passions, Talents, Skills, Values

### Passions

The things you can do all night for free if somebody let you. The things you will do if money was not a problem. The things you will do if you have all the time you need.

The world and society has been setup in such a way that you won’t really know what you really love.

The goal is to become a little bit more driven by what actually makes you feel good and lights you up inside.

### Skills

No matter where you’ve been and where you are, you have cultivated specific and unique skills that you will need in crafting the future that you want.

What are those skills?

How do they come into play when designing the life you want to be living?

All the tools you picked up along the way will be handy on the road ahead.

### Talents

We have gifts that we naturally possess.

Ask your bestfriend to write you a list of the things you are good at.

### Values

What matters more to you than money?

Why?

Those are your values.

The opportunity you are considering must not negate your values.

Your values will be a filter to opportunities that come your way.

## Excavate Your Childhood

There are events or elements of your childhood that illuminate what path you must take.

If you don’t have memories, ask your family.

You need to know who you were before the world got in the way.

# Build Your Career Blueprint

If you have a big picture of what you want in your career, it provides you with enough space and flexibility to make mistakes along the way and not freak out if you veer off course a little bit because you know where you’re going. You know where you wanna end up. Wherever you are is just temporary.

Your blueprint should give you a sense of the arc that you want your career to take.

- Short-term goals
- Long game plan

Once you have an eagle’s eye view of your life, you can now focus on taking the first step in that direction.

Who are the people you want to model your career after?

It will take time to found someone you can emulate and who will make you believe you can do it too.

Studying someone else’s life and work can be the lightbulb that will make everything clear for your blueprint.

Using your blueprint, pick the spaces you want to play in.

It is never too late to pivot.

## The Art of the Mindmap

The hawkeye level is where you become specific about the details

- Business model

Identify themes you want to explore.

Later, those themes will lead to actual career artifacts.

How to create your mindmap

1. Start by understanding your Why
2. You purpose is where the center of your map will be
3. All ideas and themes connect back to your purpose
4. Connect each circle to a smaller circle.

You can come back to your mind map again.

Update your mind map when you are in the middle of a transition.

# Build Your Network

When times are tough, your people are your safety net.

## Appoint your "Board of Advisers"

5-10 people

They don’t invest in your business but are investing in you in other ways.

Look at yourself as a business, as a brand.

What is the culture you are building from ground zero?

Who are you surrounding yourself with even before you have gotten any traction?

Who are you turning to when you are in trouble or when you need advice?

Appoint your board and be very intentional about where you want them to sit in your life.

Tell them you have appointed them

But be mindful of their time.

## How to Find Your Mentor

Court them a little. Build a relationship. You don’t ask them to be your mentor immediately.

Ask 15 minutes of their time. Do your homework. Do not waste their time. Be prepared for the question that will come up—What can I do for you? Be specific about what it is you are looking for.

## Don't Just Look Up. Look Around.

A mentor does not have to be older than you.

Seek peer to peer mentorship esp when you are doing something that has never been done before.

There is support to be found around the network you have already cultivated.

Build community without looking for anything in return.

## Digital Mentors

Some of your people are people you will never meet.

Whether or not these mentors respond, there is so much value you can get in curating your set of digital mentors that you follow and study and inspired by.

You have so much people in the internet you can curate to create an integrated lifestyle or philosophy of living to follow.

## Your Manager is Not Always Your Mentor

Build a set of mentors who are not connected to you financially.

## Lift as You Rise

Cultivate opportunities not just for yourself but for other people.

Once you are at the seat, make room for other to have a seat. Be intentional in looking for who needs to join the table.

Be a servant leader.

# Search for Opportunities and Side Hustles

## The Art of the Side Hustle

Provide options and outlet to bring yourself more and cultivate your skillset.

An hour before and after work, dream in your notebook about what will fuel your passion.

Create a list of possible side hustles.

## Find Opportunities in Your Day Job

From your list of side hustle ideas, you can choose some that you can integrate into your current day job as a new role.

When you have a day job, sometimes you don’t have the energy to do more outside of that day job, so if you can integrate a side hustle idea within the day job, that would be great.

## Test a Freelance Gig

Before leaving a day job, test the waters through a freelance gig.

# Taking the Leap to Be Your Own Boss

When do you know you’re ready to take the leap to be your own boss?

When you feel you want to quit your job, pause and ask yourself,

“Have I reached the point of diminishing returns?"

- Is there something I have yet to learn?
- Is there still a skill that I am honing here that I am going to need in my next chapter?
- Is there a financial goal that I have yet to hit?

Go back to your zone of genius and ask yourself if there are still more you need to get from this day job that you will be cheating yourself from all of it if you walk away from it today?

Would you have any regrets?

## Don't Let Fear Dictate Your Direction

Fear is the reason why we stay in places where we are no longer growing.

“I think the universe is telling you to be a little bit braver right now.”

If you know you are ready but are just struggling to take that final step, go to your board of advisers. Go to someone who sees the great potential in you and allow them to be your mirror and mirror back the courage you already posess.
