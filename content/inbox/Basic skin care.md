# Basic skin care

There are three main steps in doing basic skin care:

1. Determine your skin type.
2. Construct a simple skin care routine.
3. Identify products you need to use in your routine based on your skin type.

Before doing a routine, it’s important to identify the skin type you have. This is an important step because your choice of products is determined by your skin type. To identify your skin type, follow the steps in [[How to determine your skin type]].
