# Present your ideas using logic then emotions

To learn [[How to unpack an IP snapshot]], present your ideas from left to right. That is, start by presenting with a logical emphasis first and an emotional emphasis second.

Using the [[Pink sheet]], this is done by presenting the elements of your IP from left to right:

1. Share your model. Show the logical framework for people to follow.
2. Share a metaphor. Engage the audience with a more abstract and creative perspective.
3. Share the point you are trying to make.
4. Share a case study. Provide the practical and analytical details.
5. Share a story. Demonstrate what the point really means then engage the audience at a more emotional or personal level.
