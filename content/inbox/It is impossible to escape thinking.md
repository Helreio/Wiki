# It is impossible to escape thinking

The moment you have consciousness, you think. This means there is logic there. There is perspective. It is impossible to escape thinking. You are only able to make sense of your experience in deep meditation because you are thinking. And by thinking I simply mean you are aware, you are aware of what you see.

What you aren't doing is judging, putting values on what you see. You are seeing, what exists, you are trying to be as objective as you can. How is this different from the work of a scientist? Not much in goal. But in method.
