# The Ikot begins through the arrival of warriors from the nearby ili signaling the beginning of the journey.

P1 travels at the nearest destination, the central ili.

Encounters danger along the way.

Arrives at the central ili.

Description of the ili and its past.

Welcoming rituals.

The singing of the First Song itself.

After, news broke out that the ili of P1 was destroyed and the Babaylan holding the Third Song was killed.

P1 never get to hear the song of his cherished teacher.

And everyone has to troubleshoot for what has occurred.
