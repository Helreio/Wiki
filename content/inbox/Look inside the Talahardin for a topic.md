# Look inside the Talahardin for a topic

When you [[Write using permanent notes]], finding a topic to write about should not be a problem if you have dedicated yourself to writing notes in your [[Talahardin]] every day. To find a topic, look into your Talahardin ([[start]] is helpful here) and identify the clusters that you have built around.

You do not have to make the decision about what is worth writing because you have already made that decision every time you write in your Talakahon.

If you look inside the Talakahon for a topic, you know that it is tried and tested. [[Write about something you already have notes on]].
