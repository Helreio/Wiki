# On who will be handing our finances

I proposed that as long as she is in a breadwinning role, we will be handling our finances separately. She was skeptical about this arrangement although she understands the rationale behind it (it is a loving arrangement, considering she will be spending more than I do).

The reason I propose this is because I want her to learn how to manage her own finances.

She said that if we ever come to a sitatuation where she is the only one making money and I stay at home, that is actually a situation where she wants me to handle the finances. This is understandable. I agree with this.

Writing this now, I think there is a way for us to combine both of our insights:

1. We will be making separate incomes.
2. Each of us will have the final say to where these incomes will go.
3. We will be instituting funds for needs that we share.
4. We will hold monthly conversations about our monies and I will be the primary facilitator for this.
