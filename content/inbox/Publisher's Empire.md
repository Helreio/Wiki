# *The Book Publishing Timeline*

How to estimate the time it will take to write a book

1. Determine total word count you plan to write every day.
2. Multiply words per day by 30 days (this will give you total words written per month).
3. Based on book length expectations and the type of book you want to write, divide that number by total pages per month (this will give you how many months it will take to write your book as an estimate).

Create two timelines

1. Ideal timeline
2. Slower more realistic timeline

# *Book Market Research*

The action or activity of gathering information about reader’s needs and preferences.

Why it matters?

To be sure someone will show up.

**Tools**

1. Google Trends
2. Google Adwords
- [ ] Tools > Keyword Planner
- [ ] Enter product_service_search term
- [ ] Determine average monthly searches for your term (and where they are trending).
- [ ] At the bottom, review alternative terms that correspond with your original idea (but may be more popular).
3. Amazon “autofill” search function
- [ ] When people are searching at Amazon, they are looking to BUY.
- [ ] Type keyword on the search box.
- [ ] Pay attention to the words and phrases that begin appearing as you type. Those that show up first are the most searched terms in Amazon (therefore, the most likely to be heavily trafficked)

Whatever keywords are trending, be sure to use them in your description and when you upload the book in Amazon.

**When you should and shouldn’t rely on market research**

Should do it if you’re catching a trend.

First, decide what’s worth writing, then do the market research next to determine how you’re going to market it.

Shouldn’t do it if you’re writing evergreen content. (example: The War of Art)

**Homework**

Conduct your preliminary market research for your book idea

1. Test out the tools for the main topic of your book.
2. Determine whether your topic is trending up, down, or staying steady, and if there are alternative phrases you can use (or angles you can take to promote your book).

Find the sweet spot between:

1. What’s trending.
2. What’s being searched.
3. What you can dominate.

# *The Book Marketing Canvas: Unique Value Proposition (UVP)*

People will ask: why should I care?

A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered and acknowledged and a belief from the customer that value will be delivered and experienced.

A unique value proposition makes you stand out from what’s out there.

**Questions**

- Whats unique about your book?
- Why should your reader care?
- Why shouldn’t you be ignored?
- Most importantly: are these differences that matter?

**Examples that can make your book unique**

- Is it the authors credentials and testimonials?
- Is the book the only one in a niche that is underserved in the Amazon marketplace?
- Is it packaged or designed differently?
- How you launch and promote your book
