I feel sad to see how traveling has been prostituted.

If you travel only to escape a dull life, please stop.

Create a life you wont need to escape from. Then you can travel from a better place.

Like with most things, treating traveling with this mindful, dare I say "sacred" quality, makes it all the more fulfilling.

No, dont use all that money to travel. Use that money to settle on what you really want and who you really are. Then and only then will travel be great
