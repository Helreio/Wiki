# The Power of Forgiveness

A priest is trying to build a forgiveness memorial near the twin towers where people could intentionally go and meditate.

Forgiveness is a couragous act of choosing not to opt in a cycle of violence.

When we were hurt, we can decide not to be hurt by someone again. But we can also do that with hatred in our hearts, compassion to my own predicament or forgiveness to the human qualities that lead to violence.

We can protect ourselves from more violence without resorting to more violence and more hatred and vengeance.

Forgiveness is a choice. It shouldn't be pushed on anyone.

I was wronged but I am ready for a different idea instead of anger, bitterness, or war.
