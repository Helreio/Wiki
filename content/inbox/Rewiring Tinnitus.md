# Rewiring Tinnitus

# Chapter 2 - What Exactly is Tinnitus?

How you got your tinnitus is less important than how you choose to deal with it.

It is a top priority to find a doctor, whether an audiologist, otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, and throat doctor), or a neurologist, who is knowledgeable about tinnitus and aware of the various treatment options.

- Find a doctor with an uplifting personality, one who leaves you with a sense of hope and optimism.

Rule out any potentially treatable medical conditions that could be causing your tinnitus.

- Use hearing aids if your tinnitus is caused by hearing loss.

Our brain is able to identify a sound by matching the electrical patterns with familiar patterns from memory.

- When we hear a sound for the first time, we label it, assign meaning to it, and react accordingly.
- The meaning we assign to it and how we react depends entirely on how the sound makes us feel and whether we believe it is something positive or negative.
- When we hear the sound again, we remember it as well as what it means and how it made us feel.
- If our reaction to a sound is consistent, over time it becomes an automatic response that activates both the limbic system, triggering an emotional response, and the autonomic nervous system, causing a physical response in the body.
- A sound can be so closely intertwined with a specific response that, when we hear it, we react automatically without thinking at all.
- In the case of tinnitus, this is where the problems arise. When perceived as an annoyance or a threat, our body reacts automatically to tinnitus as if we were in danger, triggering a stress response. But in reality, tinnitus is no more threatening or dangerous than the sound of a ceiling fan.

Even people who don’t have tinnitus can hear the sounds of tinnitus under the right conditions.

Tinnitus is not something dangerous or threatening or sign of internal damage. Tinnitus is the result of your brain turning up the volume of natural sounds present within the body.

- This happens as your brain attempts to compensate for changes in your sound environment such as silence, hearing loss, or exposure to sudden noise.
- It’s an overcompensation, but a natural process nonetheless.

We still don’t know why this overcompensation occurs, and we only have a rough idea of where tinnitus originates in the brain.

The sounds of tinnitus are harmless, no matter how loud they may seem, or how intrusive they are.

The only difference between someone who is tormented by the sound of their tinnitus, and someone who isn’t bothered at all, is that the sufferer’s brain perceives the sound as a threat, an annoyance, or as something dangerous, and develops a negative conditioned response of panic, anxiety, or stress.

The good news for the people who are tortured by their tinnitus is that the negative reaction can be reprogrammed, and replaced with a positive one.

**TO DO**

Buy a cheap hearing aid to test if treating hearing loss could help reverse the tinnitus.

Look for the right medical professional to help you.

# Chapter 3 - Habituation Is the Answer

Habituation

- The brain’s ability to turn down the volume of sounds that aren’t important so we can focus on the ones that are.
- Habituation is the key to living with tinnitus.

It's simply not possible to habituate to a sound that implies a threat, an annoyance, or if it carries a negative association of any kind.

You can only habituate to the sound of your tinnitus if you defuse your negative response to the sound.

How we develop a negative response to the sound of our tinnitus?

- The sudden onset of a disturbing noise led to fear.
- The sound doesn’t go away so stress and fear continue to build.
- We grieve when the sound of silence is taken away from us.
- Panic intensifies as the perceived threat becomes more real and more permanent, causing the conditioned response to grow stronger.
- Depression settles in.
- Sleep becomes difficult.

Ignoring the sound by distracting yourself or drowning it doesn’t address the underlying problem.

Emotional, physical, and psychological problems all get worse when we ignore them.

Ignoring the sound of your tinnitus will only make you more frustrated, anxious, and afraid.

- The harder you try to ignore it, the harder your brain fight to redirect your attention to the source of the perceived threat by turning up the volume even more.
- Associating the sound of your tinnitus with feelings of frustration strengthens the negative conditioning.

Every single one of us has the capacity to habituate to the sound of our tinnitus. And when we do, it may not go away, but it will stop bothering us.

Neuroplasticity

- The brain is not fixed.
- The brain remains changeable throughout our entire life.
- Under the right circumstances, the brain can forge new neural pathways, literally rewiring itself to various beneficial ends.

Tinnitus becomes a problem when we develop an automatic negative conditioned response to the sound, and that habituation is the answer, but it is only possible when there is no negative association.

Eliminate your negative response then replace it with one that is emotionally positive.

Learn how to meditate.

Meditation

- The practice of quieting the mind.
- This involves focusing your attention onto a single point of awareness (like breathing or a mantra).
- Short-term effects: triggers a relaxation response that calms the nervous system.
- Long-term effects: stress levels go down, ability to cope with stress becomes stronger, focus and concentration improve dramatically, makes you fall asleep faster and more easily

Use your tinnitus as the point of awareness for meditation.

- It is natural for your mind to wander when meditating.
- Meditating on your tinnitus will make you realize that it is possible to get your mind off the sound.
- After meditation, your tinnitus won’t bother you that much, so it won’t seem as loud.

Continue to practice meditation to shed the power of your tinnitus over you.

The goal is not to eliminate your negative response to your tinnitus but to replace it with a new, emotionally positive reaction.

- You will habituate naturally over time.
- While waiting for that to happen, turn the sound of your tinnitus into something useful, something positive.
- Use tinnitus meditation to accomplish this.

Tinnitus meditation can also enable the habituation process to occur.

- Meditation associate the deep relaxation of meditation with the sound of your tinnitus, completely overwriting your negative conditioned response.
- It is possible that hours or even days have passed where you didn’t think about your tinnitus at all.
- By choosing to focus on the sound on your own terms, and on your schedule, you will start to focus on it less the rest of the time.

TRT

- Goal: To enable a person to habituate to the sound of their tinnitus.
- Three-pronged approach: (1) Doctor educates patient about tinnitus, (2) Doctor fits expensive sound masking devices to the patient, (3) CBT.
- Cons: Takes a long time (6-24 months) to see results; requires a lot of hard work and commitment; only works if you don’t have hearing loss or can hear the masking sound; expensive

Tinnitus Meditation

- Pros: Financially accessible; could work for everyone regardless of the severity of their tinnitus or whether or not they have hearing loss; you transform the sound of your tinnitus into something useful, speeding up the habituation processes exponentially

**Step 1: First Contact Journaling Exercise**

1. Close your eyes.
2. Imagine that you are hearing the sound of your tinnitus for the very first time.
3. Write a detailed description of it. Approach this from the mindset of a curious observer, like a scientist describing a new discovery. Imagine that you are writing a letter to your loved ones to describe the sound of your tinnitus

Questions

What does your tinnitus sound like?

- Does it sound like something familiar, or anything else that you can think of?
- Is it a single tone, or multiple tones?
- Does it sound like chirping or buzzing?
- Maybe it’s more of a whooshing sound?
- Can you identify more than one noise?
- As you listen, do the sounds change at all or do they remain constant?

Where does it feel like the sound is coming from?

- Is it in your ears, or in your head?
- Or does it sound like it's coming from somewhere else entirely, as if you were near a radio?
- And how loud does it seem to be?
