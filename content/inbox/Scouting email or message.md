Hi, I’m Vince Imbat. I’m an adult self-directed learner who is exploring how to do serious philosophical work outside academia. I currently am conducting a personal research project looking for Filipinos who are doing any serious intellectual work outside academia and ideally without an MA or a PhD. I would like to get to know them and interview them if possible. I’m writing you to ask if you have encountered anyone who fits what I am looking for. Thank you.
