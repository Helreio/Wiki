# Story-telling

Storytelling can be used in organic marketing and authentic relationship building.

Storytelling helps you make sense of your past and your life so you can feel more in control of it.

Storytelling can also shape your future.

**Practice**

***1. Write it in a journal.***

- [ ] Do this to make sense of your story.

***2. Share your story conversationally to friends.***

- [ ] Lead people to the story you want to tell, not the old one.
- [ ] Take note on how they react.

***3. Share your story in written form through your blog and social media.***

- [ ] What story you tell about yourself is what others will start to tell about you.

**1. Survival Story**

- [ ] The story that kept you alive.
- [ ] Pour it out without self-editing.
- [ ] Read it once in a while to reflect on.
- [ ] Identify your values (nonnegotiable guiding beliefs) from this story.
- [ ] Identify how your life is in conflict with these values.
- [ ] Retell and live your story with the goal of living according to your values
- [ ] Do not apologise for honest mistakes.
- [ ] Do not feel guilt or shame.

**2. Past Story**

- [ ] The story that’s holding you back.
- [ ] A mistake or something.
- [ ] Write it with a shift in perspective.
- [ ] Practice telling it as a way to reclaim and own it and to tell a new story.
- [ ] You own it but it’s done and gone.

***3. Underdeveloped Story***

- [ ] The story that’s not ready yet.
- [ ] Direction to where you want to go, what you want to do, who you want to work with, etc.
- [ ] Write the story to remedy what’s holding you back.

**Summary**

Find the deep, underlying and soulful values or “guiding beliefs” behind your survival story.

Re-frame and make peace with an old, stale story that’s been “holding you back."

Remedy why you feel like your story “isn’t ready yet” - and embrace storytelling to get your head, gut and heart on the same wavelengths.
