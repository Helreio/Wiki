# Love as being boundless

Yo, kap! Thank you ulit sa thought-provoking sharing mo kagabi on loving-kindness. These three Fruit Salad sharings are really helping me think more about love, which means I am also catching myself finding ways to practice it more these days. Your sharing also continues to challenge my understanding (or lack thereof) of emotions and related phenomena.

If there is one undeniable lesson that I learned from your three workshops, it is this:

   Love is too important to be ignored and too important to not be understood.

And this is why, I wanted to enrich our conversation through a reaction to something you said last night about love. I will be disagreeing to it ha, but please treat this not as a criticism but an opportunity to extend the wonderful discourse that you started. Funny, pero kahit matagal na rin tayong magkaklala, I am still not sure how you handle disagreeing perspectives. Ako naman, I am simply coming from a place of sincere search for truth, but if I step out of the line, please call me out.

Moving on.

I can’t remember your exact words, but you said something like this:

   Love is like the Tao. It is boundless.

Feel free to clarify what you mean by that ha. But what I’ll be using in my reaction to your statement is what I understood from what you said, which is that:

   Love is fluid. It cannot be bounded. It takes many forms.

(Side note: This reminds me that this sounds similar to how you conceptualize God.)

(Another side note: I want to say that aware ako na magiging magkaiba tayo ng pananaw dito dahil magkaiba tayo ng belief on the nature of knowledge. This is another topic, pero let me know if you want me to explain what I noticed to be our difference on this respect, although medyo related din tong reaction ko to that key difference. Despite that, I still want to share this counter-reaction because, again: Love is too important a topic to not be understood.)

The gist of my reaction to what you said is this:

   **By saying that Love is boundless, we are implying that Love cannot exist and by not existing it cannot be understood.**

What I want to propose, instead, is this:

   **Love is bounded. Since it has clear boundaries, it has an identity. This identity differentiates Love from what is Not-Love. Furthermore, because it has a clear identity, we can know for sure that it exists. Because it exists, we can understand it, which also means we can generate and practice it.**

Allow me to explain.

Let’s say there is this phenomenon existing in the Universe. There was a time when you haven’t experienced this phenomenon yet so you don’t even know it existed. Then you experienced it. And you knew you experienced it because it was undoubtedly distinct from all the other experiences you had before. However, at this point, you only know it by experience. One day, you decided to use a word to refer to it. You gave it a name: “Love”.

Now, the moment you experienced it and realized it existed, you have began to differentiate it from everything that isn’t it. This was later reinforced when you used a word to name it. The moment you named it Love, you have automatically differentiated it from everything that isn’t Love (Non-Love).

But why were you able to differentiate this new experience from everything else that came before it? Because you notice its undoubted distinction from all the other things that isn’t it. This thing you called Love has innate characteristics that make it distinct from all the others. If Love is the same as all the other experiences, there is no need for it to have a different name. It needs a new name because it is different. And its innate characteristics make it different.

The innate characteristics of this thing we call Love create a boundary that differentiates and separates it from all the other things that isn’t it. And because of this boundary, we are able to understand it. Without this boundary, it’s just pure confusion. To say that Love is boundless means that giving it a name is useless as it isn’t different from any other thing existing. In fact, by being boundless, we can never fathom it, we can never understand it, we can never practice it. The same conclusion is implied if we say that, “Love takes many forms.” By itself, that statement is very murky. What does it mean? If Love takes a new form, it ceases to be Love. It becomes a new thing and it should be given a different name, otherwise, confusion. Maybe what you mean is that Love can be expressed through different ways. But, by itself, it does not change. What keeps changing, loses its identity. What loses its identity, does not exist.

(Side note: This is Aristotle, but Buddhists use the same flow of thought to deny the existence of the Self. They argue that because the Self keeps changing, it cannot exist. Therefore, Self is an illusion.)

Love has to have this boundary. Its innate characteristics has to be defined. Only then can it be understood and practiced.

I can see the aesthetic effect of seeing Love as mysterious, boundless, etc. It almost makes it something to be revered. It’s beautiful and moving. I understand this inclination. But the only way we can understand each other and make true progress in our understanding of Love is by making ourselves clear about what it really is.

We make ourselves clear by remembering that everything that exists has innate characteristics. These innate characteristics create its identity. That identity creates a boundary that differentiates it from all the other things that isn’t it.

If something has no boundaries, it has no identity, it has no innate characteristics. It is impossible to recognize and make sense of it. What more to practice it?

I don't think that this is what we want Love to be.

So what are you saying here kap? That you agree that Love is can be bouned pero it cannot be defined?

If that is what you are saying, then I agree.

I realized that the word "define" may have caused some misunderstandings here. So I made a modification sa sentences ko.

However, a close synonym to the word "define" is simply to "delimit" or "outline". It is what I am trying to say here. To bind something nang maging malinaw na iba ito sa iba.

This process of binding something does not require words. You can still stay in the wordless and know that something is bounded, that something is different from another thing.

You do not need words to bound something. Well, maganda kung pwede natin siyang i-bind through words nang maicommunicate natin sila ng maayos. Pero aware ako na may mga bagay na resist being bounded in words.

However, this does not mean that hindi sila maikakahon. The mere fact na tinuro mo siya, na ito siya, na naexperience mo siya, ibig sabihin you "noticed" its stark difference from all the others that is not it. That stark difference allows us to notice it. Otherwise, hindi natin siya mapapansin!
If something exits, it has an identity. If it has an identity, it is bounded.

For example, until now, hindi ko lubusang ma put into words ang isang symptom ko ng depression. Most suffers call it "brain zap" so yun na rin ang tawag ko. Minsan ineexplain ko this way: "Para akong kinuryente ng sobrang bilis at mahina lang pero sa utak lang." Pero even that is not enough. I know it will never be put into words. Kailangang maranasan ng kausap ko ang brain zap para maintindihan niya ang pinagsasabi ko.

Pero the point is, even if brain zap cannot be captured by words, even if it resides in the wordless, even if it cannot be defined properly, it is still bounded. Because even if I cannot put it into words:

Itong pagtulay mula sa pilosopiya papuntang mystisismo. Paano ito exactly nangyayari? How would you describe the territory of mysticism as compared to the territory of philosophy?

As far as I know, nothing is out of scrutiny, and therefore nothing is beyond philosophy. We can philsophize even about mystical experiences, because as long we have our mental faculties, as long as we are aware, we can scrutinize what we are experiencing, wordless or not. Even when the wordless is not just the territory of mysticism. In fact I would dare say that mystics are ALWAYS philosophizing (although hindi nga lang sila magaling dito kaya confusing sila madalas). When they are trying to put into words what they experienced, they are philosophizing. When they were experiencing what they experienced, they are philosophizing, because hindi nila dinanas at kinalimutan. Dinanas nila ito at sinubukang bigayan ng kahulugan. This is philosophizing. So what exactly is mysticism's territory na kailangang tawirin?

In fact, a branch of philosophy called empiricism ay ito mismo ang point of view: na wordless (sensory experience) ang simula ng lahat ng kaalaman.

1. I can notice it because it has its own distinct qualities.
2. I know that it is different from all the other experiences.

By saying that Love is boundless, we imply that it cannot be delimited and potentially defined ~~defined~~. This makes things confusing. It does not help deepen our understanding and appreciation of Love. In fact, it prevents it. Since I cannot understand nor appreciate something I cannot ~~define~~ even establish.

Love can be understood. It can be ~~defined~~ delimited and potentially defined. It can be taught (the very thing you are doing). It sounds beautiful to Tao-ify it, or turn it into this force that cannot be fathomed. But does it have to be? Is that what we see when we really look at it as it is?
