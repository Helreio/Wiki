# Life Framework Rules

**My Eulogy**

Your eulogy is contained here.

The purpose of a eulogy is for you to picture the long-term outcome of all your efforts: your legacy.

Follow Michael Hyatt’s Living Forward instructions on writing your eulogy.

**Self Info**

Your self info are important details about yourself uncovered through different tools and methods.

The purpose of this section is to have an available reference to use for updating or improving your life plan.

This section was inspired by Jenny Blake’s Pivot.

**Purpose**

At particular moments in your life, you will be guided by ONE overarching purpose.

The way you express your purpose might be different in different points of your life.

But they are all interrelated.

**Vision and Mission**

To fulfill your overarching purpose, you must create a vision of what you would like to feel and experience in the most important areas of your life.

Your vision may change every now and then. You must remind yourself every day of your vision.

Your mission is connected with your vision.

It is, ideally, what you perform every day until you get to your vision.

Like your vision, it changes. But you must remind yourself of it every day.

**Life Areas**

Life areas are the biggest, most important areas of your life you need to give attention on at particular moments in your life.

All of them are important, but you have to prioritize them.

List them down according to priority.

Each life area has core desired feelings or values and an objective attached to it.

**Life Accounts**

Each life area has smaller life accounts under it.

They are called life accounts because they are treated like bank accounts where we invest “time” in each for them to grow.

Each life account has a specific core desired feeling, value, and purpose statement attached to it.

The sum of the purpose statements of my life accounts is my overarching purpose.

**Action Plans**

Each life account needs to have an action plan detailing relevant information about it.

Each life account action plan contains a purpose statement, an envisioned future, an inspiring quote, a current reality (which includes both progress and things to improve), and finally SMART (specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time-bound) commitments

These commitments should be transferred to the back burner list for each life account.

**Back Burner**

Each life area and sub-area produces a number of projects that can be pursued at any given time.

These projects are saved in a Back Burner.

The Back Burner is divided into the four main life areas: self-care, sustenance, passion, and mission.

**Short-term Vision**

This is where your short-term vision (or pivot) plan is housed.

It consists a short-term (6 month-1 year) vision of your life.

It also has a customizable vision calendar which you can use to plan next actions.

**Active Projects**

Based on your short-term vision, this is a list of active projects you are engaged in at specific points of time under each area.

Active projects are extracted from the Back Burner.

**Active Projects Files (Desktop)**

Housed outside Evernote and in your Desktop.

Each active project will have its own active project folder which will house all related files.

**Project Plans**

Housed inside each active project folder, project plans contains the steps and actions needed to move a particular project.

**Daily**

Your daily log is perhaps the most used part of your life framework.

It is where you plan out how to live each day of your life that you manage to plan.

It contains 4 parts:

1. Short-term Vision - A table showing your ONE THING (most leveraged activity/goal) for each major life area at a particular time.
2. Most Important Tasks - Your most important task for any given day. They must be 6 or less. They will take priority over anything else you have to do on that given day.
3. Time Blocks - An hourly list where you can block or schedule specific activities at specific times of the day.
4. Master To Do List - A list of all incoming tasks. The purpose of putting it here is to be reminded of how much loose ends are waiting for you. And constantly eliminate unnecessary pieces if possible.
