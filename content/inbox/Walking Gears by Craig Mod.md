# Walking Gears by Craig Mod

[North Face fingerless “hiking” gloves](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-j/)

[Leki Microvario Carbon folding poles](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-t/)

[SUPPORTEC Men’s Tights](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-i/)

Patagonia trail running shorts

- They’re fine, but don’t breathe very well, so I’m on the lookout for unlined (harder to find than you’d think), lightweight, super-breathable trail-running shorts to put over the tights. (The shorts are mainly handy for pockets.)
- Two pairs

[Icebreaker merino wool Tech Lite t-shirts](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-d/)

- Three

[Tilly Mashup Airflo](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-h/)

- Most important

[“Cool-Lite Merino Flexi Chute”](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-k/)

[Arc’teryx black Sigma FL](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-u/)

- When I don’t wear the compression spats, I wear these (with some Icebreaker merino wool undies below).

[South Rim 600s](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-o/)

[Mountain 600s](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-b/) (for more ankle support)

[Danner Light IIs](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-n/) (resoleable)

- Resoling costs 1x-2x the cost of new non-resoleables, and non-resoleables are much more comfortable.

My ideal would be a pair of Mountain 600s that are re-sole-able.

MacBook Air M1

iPhone 11 Pro

Main camera: Leica M10 with 35mm Summilux

Secondary camera: Fuji X-T4 (with 16mm f/2.8 lens) which I use to record the *Nothing Exciting* 4K videos

[Joby Gorilla Pod](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-p/)

Gaia app

[Yamareco](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-x/)

Garmin Instinct watch (Solar Instinct might be better)

I record binaural audio using [OKM II mics](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-m/) and a [Sony PCM-A10 recorder](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-c/).

My pack is a Hyperlite Mountain Gear Junction 2400.

- For waterproofing, buy a sack liner. I use a Hyperlite liner. I also use a Hyperlite shoulder pocket, which is fantastic (it carries my wallet and phone).

Alterative: [Gossamer Gear](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-q/) (Gorilla pack)

I carry my Leica M10 via a [Peak Design Camera Clip](https://mailbot2000.craigmod.com/t/r-l-tldilhlk-ourkukyljl-a/)

Mykita sunglasses (Decades Davis)
