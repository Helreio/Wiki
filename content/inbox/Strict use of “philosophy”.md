# Strict use of “philosophy”

According to [[Napoleon Mabaquiao Jr.]], in the strict usage, the word [[thoughts/philosophy]] refers to the discipline of philosophy, i.e. asking fundamental questions about beliefs. To differentiate it from works produced in the [[Lenient use of “philosophy”]], the strict usage espouses [[Three fundamental hallmarks of philosphical works]].

This simply means that [[Philosophy as belief is different from philosophy as discipline]].
