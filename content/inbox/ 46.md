Writer **Susan Sontag** on persistence:

"It never occurred to me that I couldn’t live the life I wanted to lead. It never occurred to me that I could be stopped...

I had this very simple view: that the reason people who start out with ideals or aspirations don’t do what they dream of doing when they’re young is because they quit.

I thought, well, I won’t quit.”
