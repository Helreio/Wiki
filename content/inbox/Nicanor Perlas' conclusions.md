# Nicanor Perlas' conclusions

MANY ARE FED UP WITH THIS MEDICAL TYRANNY. IT's time tk stop it

- physical distancing is unnecessary
- the virus is not deadly
- there is very little evidence on the use of face mask (less than 2% benefit in 100 days)
- "For me, appropriate wearing of face mask is a training to be conditioned to follow authority whether that authority is right or not. Uto-uto tayong lahat. Masunurin lang tayo sa pagsusuot ng face mask kahit hindi na kailangan."
- all the safety measures are conditioning us to fear a relatively harmless virus
- The vaccines are very very dangerous
- We never had an epidemic. Far from it!
