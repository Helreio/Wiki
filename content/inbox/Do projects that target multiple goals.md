# Do projects that target multiple goals

You can only work on a finite number of [[Project]]s at any given time due to cognitive, physical, and logistical limits.

Because of these constraints, a very wise approach is to choose projects that target multiple number of [[Goal]]s or ends.

To do this:

1. Define all your desired ends. For ideas on how to do this see: [[State what you want as a goal or a standard]].
2. List all the projects you want to do.
3. Mishmash all in such a way that one project fulfills multiple end goals.

An example of a project that targets multiple goals is doing fieldwork (see [[Walking accomplishes multiple goals]]).
