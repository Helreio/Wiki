# Some Meditations on Community

How can we balance our need for community and our need for authenticity?

In an ideal world, the two are always together. An individual finds a place in the middle of the great wilderness of society that she can call “home": a place where she can have both - a place where she can feel belongingness and where she can be true to herself at the same time.

I sincerely believe that there are place like these. People who are gifted in holding spaces for others have attempted to create them and have succeeded.

Cite Radha Agrawal.

Cite Parker Palmer.

But these places can also be quite rare. All over the world, people have been part of groups where their voices, values, beliefs, and ideas have been discouraged, ignored, and even ostracized. From nation states to religions, to families and romantic relationships, we’ve all experienced compromising who we are so we can fit in. Sometimes, we don’t have a choice because we are compelled by the powerful to conform. But often times, we do so purposefully because we badly needed the companionship of others. And since finding “the right people” takes a lot of time and effort, we get lazy and settle with the what is readily available even if it’s not the best we can have.

Why is it so difficult to create communities where people also feel authentic?

I realized that a relationship with anyone other than me is only possible if there is a shared meaning involved. I can only be in a romantic relationship with someone if both of us share certain meaningful roles and practices that declare to ourselves and others that we are “in this together” (dating, celebrating anniversaries, etc.). I can only be in a relationship with friends or schoolmates who share with me a constructed meaning of past experiences from school. I can only be in a relationship with my countrymen if I share with them our history and culture. And so on and so forth.

The bottom line is that communities are created from shared meaning.

Now, this is where communities can get into some very awkward situations with the individual.

The individual also has a relationship with herself. The individual has her own story about herself (personal values, beliefs, ideas, etc.) and these story may not necessarily be the same as the story of other people or other groups of people.

In an ideal world, we only get in a relationship with people who have more or less the same values, beliefs, or ideas. Doing relationship this way means that each member conserves energy and spends less effort managing differences.
