# Three kinds of freedoms in walking

According to [[Frédéric Gros]], there are three kinds of freedoms that walking bestows upon the walker:

1. Suspensive freedom: This freedom is experienced even in a short stroll but is accentuated by a longer excursion. It is the freedom from monotony and the illusions about what is essential, which leads to the appreciation of simple joys.
2. Transgressive freedom: This freedom is more agressive—more rebellious. It is a freedom born from not settling on a brief escape from monotony as is afforded by the former freedom. It signifies a complete break, possibly longer excursions. The main difference here is that [[Walking could break your sense of identity]] produces the following experiences:

   > …surfeits of fatigue that make the mind wander, abundances of beauty that turn the soul over, excesses of drunkenness on the peaks, the high passes (where the body explodes).

1. Renunciatory freedom: The most uncommon kind of freedom that walking produces. It involves an intense experience of presence. It coincides with the Pilgrim stage in the [[Four stages of life in Hindu philosophy]].
