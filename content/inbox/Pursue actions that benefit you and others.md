# Pursue actions that benefit you and others

In the platonic realm, relationships have a real metaphysical existence. This means that we can either act according to mental and physical duality or act according to platonic terms—treating ourselves as individuals but interconnected individuals, whose states are affected intimately by the states of others.

Knowing this, we have a choice to make. Should we act in a way that only serves our self-interest or act in a way that serves both our interest and those of the interest of others?

If I want to be happier, to live a life filled with Ginhawa, I need to make a shift from being purely selfish to being someone who pursues actions that consider the well-being of others, particularly if it involves their suffering.

Now, I don’t have to frame this as a way to change the world. No. I could simply say that these things are important to me. I want to live my life based on these values. And I want to cultivate more of it.
