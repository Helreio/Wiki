# The origin of the COVID-19 virus is so critical to understanding our response to its spread

One theory on the origin of the Covid 19 virus posits that it did not evolve from Nature. It was created in the lab by integrating a spike protein from the SARS virus, a highlighly contagious virus among humans, and a coronavirus with a backbone that came from a bat coronavirus.

If it, indeed, orginated from a lab, then its release could have either been accidental or intentional. if it was accidental, the natural response would be to cover it up and minimize or downlpay it. If it was released intentionally, then what happened makes perfect sense: its severity was amplified so everyone will panic.

The origin story of the Covid 19 virus is very important because if it is, indeed, a lab product, then this should raise alarm. If it was released intentionally and its severity was excessively exaggerated, then there definitely is an ulterior motive behind its creation and release. That ulterior motive needs to be uncovered.
