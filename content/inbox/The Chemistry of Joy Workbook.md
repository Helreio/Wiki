A score of 54–80 means that your resilience skills are low and you are at high risk, or may already have symptoms of depression, anxiety, or another stress-related condition. Your subgroup scores will tell you where you are most depleted and where to put most of your energy, but you should follow all parts of the resilience pathway to get yourself back on track.
