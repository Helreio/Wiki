# The purpose of science and philosophy is to best explain the phenomena that we experience

Doesnt mean that the physical world exists

It simply means that we have a conceptual understanding, a theory, about our experience

That theory is not meant to explain phenomena in the first person. It is meant to explaine phenomena in the third person.
