# Competition in business does not excite me

If I am going to allocate my time in building something that would convince people to part from their money, I want to relate it to what I want to do: contemplating how to live.

To part with my current source of income, I need to find a way to build an audience around my creative work and hopefully establish a patronage, a monthly membership that would support me in what I want to do - a sort of early retirement passive income.
