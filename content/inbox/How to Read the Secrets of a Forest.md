# How to Read the Secrets of a Forest

Look at visible patterns (not complex) that is immediately visible in the landscape.

Species Distribution

- You donâ€™t need to know the names of each species.
- Just count the number of visibly different species.
- Why is this important? Depending on the make up of the forest, there will be different food sources for animals, different sources of survival, and different events throughout the seasons.

Age Distribution

- How many different ages of trees are in this forest? (Are there trees that are thicker than others or thinner?)
- Why important? Age distribution = Landscape history
- In an untouched forest, age distribution varies more. In a forest where trees are almost the same age, something has disrupted the natural pattern of the forest (not necessarily caused by human, can be natural causes like fires or hurricanes).
- Age distribution also tells you about the plant life or wildlife

Edge Habitat vs Forest Interior

- Canopy or no canopy affects what grows in the forest and how fast it grows
- A fully developed forest usually has a canopy where there is almost no light under it.
- Edge - more variety of plant life and wild life; edges are where meadows and forests meet or at breaks inside canopied forests where light enters
- interior - seems quiet and abandoned (plants and animals are more spread out)
- Some edge habitats are not diverse because there is less water. On the same location, there will be more variety in an edge habitat that contains a gathering of water. Water is the driver of variety.

3 Questions for reading forest ecology?

1. How many different species am I seeing?
2. How many different aged trees am I seeing?
3. Am I at the edge or the interior of this forest?

Being informed about this skills will let you make decisions based on the land.
