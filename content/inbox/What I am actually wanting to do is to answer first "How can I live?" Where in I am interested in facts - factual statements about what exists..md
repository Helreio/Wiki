# What I am actually wanting to do is to answer first "How can I live?" Where in I am interested in facts - factual statements about what exists.

My argument is that only after being clear about this can it be easier, more accurate to answer the question "How should I live?"

The model that describes what is is different from the model that describes what should be.

My short answers to my questions are

I can live life (which means act continuously until death) within the parameters of reality.

I ought to live life according to how I want to within the parameters of reality (how I want to will be different from how other people want to).
