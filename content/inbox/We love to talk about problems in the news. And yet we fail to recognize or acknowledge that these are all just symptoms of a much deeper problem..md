# We love to talk about problems in the news. And yet we fail to recognize or acknowledge that these are all just symptoms of a much deeper problem.

The solutions we try to propose work in the short term. But unless the roots are addressed they will never truly be solved.

I realize that it is in how my brain is wired that I tend to delve more on fundamental philisophical, psychological, and spiritual issues rather than those featured in the news. I dont mean to say that immediate solutions shouldnt be explored. Only to suggest that they should be viewed as that immediate solutions. And all of these solutions are “social technologies”. Like any other technology, they tend to have effects that worsen the very problem they address. And they develop dependence on more of them.
