# 2021-06 Monthly report

# Summary

This was a month of the outdoors. For the first time in my entire life, I was able to see and pass through the picturesque towns of Caliraya, Cavinti, and Pagsanjan. I spent a day in Bumbungan Eco-park. It was also a month of new friendships and deepening friendships. I met Rom Factolerin and Tina Adartse and their beautiful abode at Bay. My relationship with Diwa and Ju also deepened, while my relationship with Rem was rejuvenated with my return to their home after more than a year of the pandemic. I also got to know more of the nearby landscape. I completed a walk across the entire Jamboree road and discovered Jose Drillon Jr. Road via Diwa and Ju, perhaps the most silent trail nearby. Through it, I was able to commune with Nature like I did in Pangasinan. In terms of my life work, I was able to publish my 9th issue of Lilim, deepened my understanding of photography, and studied good prose through the recommendations of Craig Mod. I am progressing as a writer as suggested by the email I received from Ruth David. Nevertheless, this month also had the most challenging issue I went through. I went through grief from money loss due to buying a defective iPhone 11 Pro. I was able to get better after about a week through the help of my practices and friends. I learned a lot about navigating government agencies that assist in these situations. Finally, this month Shorty’s skin problem was finally solved while I also intended to improve my skin care routine.
