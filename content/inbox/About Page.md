# “How should I live?”

Hi, I’m Vince Imbat. I’m a writer passionate about the question above. To answer it, I study a wide variety of disciplines from different cultures and eras to collect insights and wisdom, which I then try to apply in my life. Whatever I learn from my research and experiments, I share in my one-insight newsletter. Click here to learn more and sign up.

## Living a good life is possible

We entered the world with no user’s manual for the most delicate possession we will ever have: our life.

Most of us will grow up in families with conflicting if not scarce advice on how we should live. Our institutions, especially our schools, were never designed to make self-knowledge a priority. On top of these, contemporary spiritual and new age cultures are not even helping as they peddle baseless and even divisive advice that do more harm than good. It’s no surprise then that despite the admirable advances in many areas of modern life, we’re not really getting happier.

Despite these, I am a firm believer that you can live a deeply fulfilling and satisfying life. This is because we have so much wisdom and insights from ancient philosophy and modern research that we can apply to lessen suffering and flourish into our best selves.

I see it as my calling to uncover these knowledge and help you understand them so you can take action and apply them in your own life. I don’t have all the answers and I am also doing this to better myself, but I am happy to share what I have learned so far.

SOME GREAT QUESTIONS TO HELP YOU THINK

YOUR COMPELLING REASON WHY

What problem, need or desire will your blog address?

What transformation do you want to affect in your readers?

How are you uniquely qualified to lead your readers on this journey?

How is your blog objectively going to be different and better than the other great blogs that cover your topics?

What are the best blogs, podcasts, videos, books, magazines, etc. that cover your topics?

Who are the most dynamic, trusted and popular voices in your space?

Why should someone read your blog instead of the likely hundreds or thousands of other good blogs that already exist on similar topics?

READER JOURNEY MAP

Imagine a reader who is brand new to your topic. She finds your blog and decides to trust you for guidance.

Where will you lead her?

What are the important milestones?

What do you want her to know or have accomplished in the next month, three months, or a year from now?

Think about your ideal reader and ask where are they now? (starting state)

Think about where they want to be? (end state)

Ask what happens next from the start state.

Then keep track of each step until you reach the end state.

Take some time, really think about this and zoom in and see every little step.

Really put yourself in the shoes of your reader. Try to remember what it was like to be where they are now.
