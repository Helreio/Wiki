# On Worldview

What people need is an explanation of reality which converts into a guide for living. This explanation serves as a validation of the way of living they choose for themselves. It’s like a compass that assures them they are on the right direction.

This explanation - this worldview - is a very personal creation. Everyone creates his_her own worldview. Even if his_her personal worldview is influenced by existing worldview around him_her, he_she ultimately decides what he/she believes in and follows. This shows that everyone is actually a “god” in a sense. Everyone can experience reality and everyone can explain this reality in words or any method that can help one make sense of this reality. Everyone can experience god - the spirit, the metaphysical.

Because everyone can have his_her personal experience with the metaphysical, it only follows that he_she can and should create his own interpretation of reality, his/her own religion if you will, an explanation or reality and a way of life based on that reality.

WORLDVIEW/RELIGION = Experience of reality + Interpretation of that reality -> Way of life

People can also share that interpretation and way of living to others. In a sense, we can be our own ministers of our own worldview and religions.
