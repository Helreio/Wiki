# Most people want fame

according to Gallup, 92 percent of American adults [say](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59153bc0e6f2e109b2a85cbc/t/5d939cc86670c5214abe4b50/1569955251457/Populace+Success+Index.pdf) that *other* people believe “a person is successful if they are rich, have a high-profile career, or are well-known.”

Our desire for fame is evolutionary:

Like our penchants for sweets and sitting around, some of our drive for fame can likely be explained by simple evolution: Being known and admired by others makes us more likely to attract a mate and pass on our genes in a competitive environment.

One 2012 [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mar.20554) found a high correlation between wanting fame and a stated desire for social recognition, financial success, and an attractive appearance, and to appear on reality television. According to a 2013 [survey](http://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FAME-Greenwood.pdf), people might want to be famous in order to be seen and valued, even by strangers; to have an elite, high-status lifestyle; or to be able to do good for others, such as by being a role model.
