# What Happens When We Price Things

Example when you price your retreat for 15,000, does it mean that it is less “valuable” than say a sports car worth 20,000? Or is it more valuable than a (blank) worth 10,000?

In monetary terms, yes. But you can see how that act of putting a measure, a “price” to it is problematic and daunting. It is a gift to be able to gather people and lead them into healing, a gift some people are unable to do. So the only true way to transmit it is by the same way, through gifting.

Any price put on a gift is the wrong price.

The only right price is how the receiver receives it.
