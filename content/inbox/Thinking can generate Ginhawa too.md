# Thinking can generate Ginhawa too

[[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]] (CBT) employs rational thinking to generate Ginhawa. Whenever we use words, we are thinking, so pratices that use words like journaling and [[thoughts/poetry]] can produce [[Ginhawa]] too (also see [[Meditation does not reside in the wordless]]).

It can be argued that rigorous thinking like philosophizing may hinder Ginhawa. But there is a way to make philosophizing easier:

- [[Why make philosophy maginhawa?]]
- [[How to do maginhawa philosophizing]]
- [[Maginhawang pamimilosopiya]]

And if philosophizing does not generate Ginhawa while we are doing it, it generates it after we gain clarity. Furthermore, there is a case for why [[Ginhawa while thinking might be more important than meditation]]
