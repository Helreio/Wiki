# *5 Ways to Set Yourself Up for Full-time Entrepreneurship*

Let's get started with an overview of how to set yourself up to make the transition to go full time. We're going to cover 5 ways to prepare to make the leap, 2 full-time transition methods, and 10 things you'll want to put in place once you're working for yourself. These are not all things I encourage you rush to do today, I just want us to start the month off with a solid overview of what will go into making a well-planned and well-thought-out transition into full-time awesomepreneurship.

*5 Ways to Prepare to Make the Leap*

Let's talk about five essential things you can do as you prepare to transition to your creative business full time.

**1. Make a Creative Action Plan**

I get that business plans are not the sexiest thing ever. But, let's be honest, one of your most major life decisions ever probably deserves a plan for success, yes?

I'll tell you more about how I made the transition in the "2 full-time transition methods" section below and in the short video I post in our [Facebook Group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/goindependent) today, but honestly, having a creative action plan and a business plan calmed my mind so much. And for an overthinker like me, the level of planning I did was probably what made my transition possible.

So, if you haven't seen it on my site already, I take you through how to write your own creative action plan (the better-looking and more humorous cousin of a business plan) in detail, with worksheets, [in this post](http://byregina.com/creative-action-plan/). I really wrote that post in anticipation of this moment--of GoIndependent--because I believe in the power of an action plan so much. I highly suggest using some of the homework days on our calendar above, or some of the interview-only days, or perhaps some time later today, to [get your Creative Action Plan done](http://byregina.com/creative-action-plan/).

**2. Free Up More Time**

This is one of the things that made the biggest difference in my transition, and it did the same for several other people I've talked to. In whatever ways you can, by the way [I thought of 10 ways for you here](http://byregina.com/more-time-and-money/), free up more time for your business planning, for your creative/client work, and for building your brand's audience. There are tons of [epic time investments](http://byregina.com/time-investments-in-your-business/) you can make with your freed up time, **but planning and doing things that will build your audience probably outrank them all.**

I used all the time hacks I could think of, and was even eventually able to drop down to part time at my job when I was transitioning to working for myself alone, for the second time in life.

*"Wait, do you mean you've failed before, Regina?"*

My friend, I "fail" at least once a day, but you and I know the key to being epic anyways, right?

" [Wax on, wax off.](https://youtu.be/fULNUr0rvEc)" Put solid habits into place. Practice. Gain knowledge. Gain experience. Then **show up** and do it again with a better approach.

**3. Cut Expenses**

Please believe me on this one, learning to live lean will help you so much. It will help you save money, it will help you if your business hits a slow month, it will help you think creatively out of necessity--I mean, I know my roommates and I invented some pretty creative "struggle meals" in college. **Necessity is the mother of invention** and all that.

Cut expenses as much as you can so that you'll have less of a financial burden/stress, more money to invest in business tools and growth, and less to worry about. This article on how to free up more time + money will hopefully help you plan and ask yourself some questions that allow you to cut back, if you haven't already. The methods I put in [that article](http://byregina.com/more-time-and-money/) and in [this very honest video](https://youtu.be/aefBfdQeO6M) are real. They really work.

**4. Establish Systems**

During the scrappy, lean time of building your full-time creative business from scratch, and definitely when you operate it full time, there is just going to be a lot of uncertainty--a lot of change--a lot of needing to stay "on your toes" and whatnot. That's the phrase, right?

Basically, whether you're a **strict scheduler** or a **fly by the seat of your pantser**, change is coming. Change is real. Which, though he had a different meaning, is an epically sung [Sam Cooke song](https://youtu.be/gbO2_077ixs), no?

Establishing systems is more important to me than setting a schedule. Especially for those of us who just don't do well with doing the same things at the same time every day. Now, for those of you who love to have a set schedule, I admire your awesomeness. Even still I'd say:

**Establishing systems is more important than establishing a schedule.**

Systems allow you to repeat and automate actions with efficiency. Systems make sure you know everything that goes into an action_project_need and they allow you to do the work in a guided manner, in less time. I don't want to be all 13-yo girl drama, *but* **systems make the business world go 'round**.

"What types of things should you look into systems for?" you might ask. Well, << Test First Name >>, I'm glad you brought this up.

There should be set systems for:

- Creating the types of content you'll repeatedly create (videos, blog posts, podcasts, social media content, emails, etc.); perform the actions over and over, do research, and develop a sensible system and checklist for how you approach them.
- Automation of payments, receipts, registrations, file delivery, data entry, and more.
- Client projects; there should be a set system of attack for projects--make it a checklist so that you're not forgetting anything.
- What else can you think of that could have a system, checklist, or automated process?

**5. Create a Financial Plan**

Can I tell you about my biggest frustration with business owners? I've had several friends and family members over the years who started businesses of some sort. Some I thought had amazing ideas, some I didn't understand at all but still wanted to support, but here's the thing . . . the ones that didn't work out had one major factor in common . . . **the business owner would not, for whatever reason, create a financial plan**.

If you're not willing to create a budget, set income goals, track your expenses, and be honest with yourself as to whether or not you're reaching milestones, then I really think you're setting yourself up for stress . . . and certainly for a lack of organization in your finances.

If your business idea + execution are solid, your numbers will eventually show that. If you have an idea that's not the best fit for you, your numbers will eventually show that. If you don't keep accurate numbers + goals, it will easily lead to confusion and frustration. I've done it myself several times. I've seen others do it. Don't let a great idea suffer under fear of money.

Anyone interested in a full lesson on creating a financial plan? [Tweet me](http://twitter.com/byreginatv) how excited you are about GoIndependent if so, please.

# *2 Full-Time Transition Methods*

So, do you just make the jump? Do you plan for several years? Several months? Have a certain amount saved up? A certain level of business income you need to reach? How do you actually know when it's time to make the transition?

Well, I want to present two main ways--P.S. I chose the second one. Assuming you've validated your content idea (by creating tons of content and seeing that it can be monetized because people love it and are willing to pay for it), then I think there are at least two ways to approach the transition with wisdom.

**1. Save Up X Months of Living Expenses**

This is the method I hear most often--save 6 months of living expenses--or save 3 months--or save 9 months, etc. This will give you a solid cushion to live off of while you continue to build your business. As much as I like this method, it applies to certain people in certain situations.

**This method is good for those who:**

- **are building a business that requires their full-time attention to make it work** --hint: this is not actually necessary for most creative businesses--most can be built part time
- **get extremely stressed about money when their savings account dips below a certain level**

But, let's talk about the other method I want to present as well. The one I used.

**2. Go X Months in a Row at a Certain Income Level (from Your Business)**

If I can be completely honest with you, I don't know if I was ever going to save 6 months of living expenses from my job. I couldn't fathom waiting that long to leave my job, and to be honest, that method has the least to do with the actual validity and profitability of your business out of all the methods ever.

When I wanted to quit, I told myself that if I could just make $Y per month from my business, for 6 months in a row, it would be a great indicator that I could keep it up long term. You can set your $Y at:

- enough to live off of
- slightly less than enough (with the assumption that when you have more time you'll be able to make more money--but, try to have some money saved up if you choose this option)
- more than enough to live off of

I set my $Y at enough to live off of plus a small cushion. I was so ready to leave my job. Once I hit $Y for 6 months, I knew I could make it on my own. I delayed a little even after that ( *hello fear, my old friend* ), but eventually I made the transition fully confident that I needed to do so in order to keep my sanity and grow my business.

**This method is good for those who:**

- **would have an extremely difficult time saving up 6 months worth of expenses but are willing to side hustle really hard to make business income**
- **are interested in validating their idea through implementation and social proof before making the transition**

So, which method are you thinking about? Do you feel there's something different you'd like to try? Put it into an actual plan and you're setting yourself up to make it happen.

And now, let's move on to a few quick points about where you're headed and what you can do for homework this weekend and next week.
