# Interview with Billy Broas of Email Boss

Two styles of marketing

- **Direct response marketing** /advertising - less obvious
- **Big brand advertising** - more obvious

Since you are a small business, follow the small business playbook.

**Follow the small business, direct response marketing**

- Measurable

Big companies

- More stakeholders
- stock holders
- PR
- They’re not always doing it just for the profit

**Small business**

- **Sales and marketing are the most important thing.**
- **You need to be a marketer.**

Start studying direct response marketing.

- **Direct response copywriting - getting inside the head of the prospect, figuring out what drives them, and writing a message special for them.**

Authors to start reading

- **Dan Kennedy** - study all his books
- For beginners: **“Ultimate Marketing Plan”**, **"No BS Direct Marketing for Non-direct Marketing Businesses"**

You can’t outsource marketing. You need to learn marketing.

**Look at marketing as a way to help people get what they already want.**

When you go down the marketing path and see its impact on people, you will fall in love with it.

**Marketing is primarily about understanding what people want and crafting a message for them.**

- You can delegate the more technical sides of it eventually: setting up webpages, loading emails to your email software, etc.

Marketing is a state of mind that can be applied on almost anything.

- Seeing their problems from their point of view, not from yours.
- **Applied form of empathy.**
- Deep work of marketing: **understanding your customer (this is the most critical part)**. Only after this is clear, then you build the structure of your marketing campaign

Marketing never change. Old school.

People’s wants don’t change.

- Fun
- Status
- Sex
- Recognition

Start with these basic principles and unchanging facts and layer the technology on top of that.

**Study the old school guys**

- David Ogilvy
- Claude Hopkins

**Old school marketers spent 80% of their time understanding their customers (empathy work)**

- Obsessed with their customers (that’s we’re they start)

It all started with guys selling books by mail to order.

**Book: The Robert Collier Letter**

We are selling an end outcome/result.

The best marketers are not mainstream.

**Email conversion is the thing.** Email centric.

What if I don’t have an email list?

- Build a list as soon as possible from day one.
- Start with the audience, who you want to serve.
- **“You need to find products for your customers, not customers for your products."**
- **Start with the market. Get clear about who you want to help.**
1. **Start with the avatar.**
2. **Hangout with them in person, Facebook groups, forums.**
3. **Listen, ask questions.**
4. **Get an idea what you could offer and provide value for.**
5. **Start to create content.**
6. **Email list. Think of a simple freebie to give in exchange of their emails.**
7. **Have continuous relationship with them.**
8. **Continue to have a dialogue with your market. They will help you co-create your product for them.**

**Don’t do**

1. **Guess what they want.**
2. Not build an audience.
3. Spending too much time and money to create something people don’t like.

Be very guerilla.

*On writing a sales page*

**The headline is the bulk of it.**

- **Don’t use the headline to sell.**
- **The goal of the headline is to get people to read more of what’s in the page.**
- **Spend your most time here as well as the lead (the beginning).**

**Sales pages are a breathing thing.**

- **Don’t need to perfect it.**
- **Just get it good enough.**

**Take enough space to make your argument**

**Gun to the head copywriting**

- If you have a gun to the head by a potential customer what would you say?
- **If they need to know it, leave it on the page.**

**Then go back and remove what is superfluous.**

**Let it sit and get what data you get.**

**Just get your version 1 out there**

::If they read your sales page and they didn’t buy, they should still go and say, I’m glad I read that. And when they’re reading it they need to feel I’m really glad I’m reading this.::

**Transform your sales page into a letter.**

**The best marketing is education.**

- **Not salesy**
- **Layout facts**
- **Have a logical argument**

Once that’s done, it will sell itself.

**After that, put info on the deal.**

Copywriters

- **Perry Belcher - 21 steps sales letter**
- **Clayton Makepeace (cheat sheet)**

**Structure**

1. **Get their attention at first.**
2. **Get them interested.**
3. **Draw them deeper in.**
4. **Make your argument.**
5. **Educate them.**
6. **Get to the deal.**

Emails every day. Short nuggets of wisdom.

**Free content**

- **Start with your goals. What’s your end outcome here?** Is it to sell a course or to be an influencer? Get speaking gigs? Advertising revenue?
- Gary V is an influencer so he gives things away for free.
- **If you are a course creator: understand your prospect inside and out -> to get to the goal they want, the next step is not consume free content, but to go to the course**
- You need to be the trusted adviser here
- Providing free content gets you views but does not get you course students
- Remove the barriers to buying because buying is how they will solve their problem
- **The content you give for free should just be insightful.**
- **Put them on the right direction in terms of buying your course or not buying it.**

The environment where your content is in really matters.

Never measure what you’re giving in hours. People need more of the outcome, not the hours of content.

**Aim to the center of your bullseye when it comes to your customer avatar. You don’t want people who devalue what you have to offer.**

**Continue to remind them of the outcome they want.**

- Ramit Sethi about when he wrote the book. He didn’t stop making sure they find his book. He wants to make sure they finish reading the book.

**Once they’re in the course, how do you make sure that they get through?**

- **Give them a quick win.**
- **The first module needs to be a quick win.**

**Most of your revenues will come not from the first product but from additional products you sell them.**

- Most income will come from people who go deeper with you.

It’s difficult to build a business just selling one product.

- **It’s easier to sell an existing customer more products.**
- It’s tougher to get a new customer for your one product.

**The more people finish your course, the more you can sell your other products to.**

**Book: The Completed Course by Carrie Rose**

Customer satisfaction is a better metric than course completion.

- What is the lifetime value of a person who was satisfied with the course but didn’t complete it vs someone who finished it?
- It’s one thing to have a satisfied customer. It’s another to have a repeat customer.
- At the end of the day, what you want is for people to come back and buy another product from you.

Look at your course as something you go through multiple passes.
