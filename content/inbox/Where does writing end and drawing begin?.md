# Where does writing end and drawing begin?

Both use symbols.

Both use inscribing tools (they become writing materials or drawing materials depending on what they were used for).

But there is one process happening essentially:

1. You have a concept in your mind.
2. You wish to communicate it (for yourself, for others, for future use).
3. You inscribe it using 2 tools (to write and to write on).
4. What you inscribe follow rules (drawings capture visualizable concepts, words capture both visualizable and nonvisualizable concepts).

My conclusion: writing is simply an extension of drawing. You cannot draw an abstract concept but you can write it (or is it?).

What things can you write about which you can't draw?

What I don't really agree with is total separation of the two crafts. Paintings only or writings only.

On a project where both are combined, one will probably be used more than the other. But the two work best together and no other field is this practiced than in comics.

Scott Mccloud's explanation is so vivid and easy to understand.

But this talk is not really about what is a better way of communication. Some people prefer to imagine what is being communicated themselves without the use of images. Writer's could be better writers not by watching film but by reading good writing.

My position is my position with most things:

- acknowledge the variety of how we communicate, recognize and even celebrate this variety
- use what works best for you. The worst that could happen to you is to use a method that does not suit your style.
- Be knowledgeable to as much ways of communicating as you can master so that you can use the best method appropriate in a given situation

It is probably wrong to say that one method is better than the other or that one method (writing) is more advanced and therefore more sophisticatedly desireable than other.

Even an abstract concept like trust can be drawn. Letters and drawn images are the same. They capture particular referents from the universe, whether concrete or abstract.
