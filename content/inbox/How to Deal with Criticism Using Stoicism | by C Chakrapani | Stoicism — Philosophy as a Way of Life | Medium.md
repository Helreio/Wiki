20 Highlights from How to Deal with Criticism Using Stoicism | by C Chakrapani | Stoicism — Philosophy as a Way of Life | Medium

---

before dealing with other people’s criticism, we should first understand that the belief that someone criticized us is an ‘impression’, which can be right, wrong, or irrelevant. Remember, when we criticize others we believe we are not criticizing but just telling it the way it is.

---

when we think someone criticizes us, the first thing we need to do is to assess the validity of the impression that the other person is criticizing us. What was said was someone else’s opinion and therefore we don’t need to get upset about it.

---

When someone provokes you, if you respond with anger or some other negative emotion, your mind is tricked into believing you are being harmed. So it is essential not to respond to impressions impulsively. Take some time before reacting. You will see you are in better control. — Epictetus, Enchiridion, 20

---

We ignore the criticism and simply examine it to see if it is valid. If it is, we can accept it and use it to change our behavior if we see that doing so will be in line with virtuous behavior. No problem here. It can be a valuable input to us.

---

1. Most people are likely to be wrong

---

We can start with the idea that other people’s criticism may be an indication that we are on the right path. After all, it is more likely that the majority is often wrong than right.

---

Human affairs are not so happily ordered that the better things are pleasing to the many; a proof of the worst choice is the crowd. — Seneca, On the Happy Life, 2.1

---

2. Insult loses its force unless we are offended by it

---

The success of an insult depends on the sensitivity and the indignation of the victim. — Seneca, On the Happy Life, 2.1

---

People often criticize others to elicit some reaction from them. But if the criticism evokes no response, it loses all its sting.

---

Stand by a stone and insult it, what response will you get? Likewise, if you listen like a stone, what would the abuser gain by his abuse? — Epictetus, Discourses 1.25.28

---

3. Undeserved contempt deserves contempt

---

When we don’t defend ourselves against other people’s unjustified criticisms, then it is as though we accept the criticism. But by not defending ourselves we treat contempt with contempt.

---

We are calm because we would rather spend our time pursuing excellence or virtue than respond to the criticisms of the ignorant.

---

You should listen to the insults of the ignorant with equanimity. When you are marching toward virtue, treat contempt with contempt. — Seneca, Moral Letters, 76M

---

If you are despised because you want to be despised and not because you must be despised, you have contempt under control. — Seneca, Moral Letters, 105

---

4. Not giving life to inert criticism

---

Most unjustified criticisms are inert and lifeless. They gain vitality through our response. When we respond, we grant life to the criticisms and give them the power to affect us. We don’t need to do this.

---

In the final analysis, if someone criticizes us and if we find that we are not at fault, we can follow Marcus Aurelius’ advice:

---

Does someone despise me?That’s their problem. Mine is to ensure that what I do or say does not deserve sneer.Does someone hate me?Again, it is their problem. My job is to be friendly and charitable to everyone including those who hate me and show them their mistake.Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.13
