# Experiment #2

I carried the DSLR. I borrowed it from Gyra. Gyra is our photojournalist, but not for this night. Tonight, I will be taking the photos. And this is because Ruth is here. She will be in a gown and what else they will require her to wear. The light will be all around her, shining on her face. And I need a reason for her to see me while all of these were happening. I really like this girl. We have been texting a lot since the science camp, and I am falling to her. I don’t know why. And this is the only night I get to see her again. A few months from now, we’ll be going to college. I’ll be in Baguio and she’ll be staying in Vigan. We won’t be seeing each other again. So yeah, I’m taking the camera tonight. I’ll be staying as close to the stage as possible, and take these photos. If they’ll be the last I take of Ruth, so be it. Here she comes, wearing her gown—blue all over. I have to come near her and take this shot.
