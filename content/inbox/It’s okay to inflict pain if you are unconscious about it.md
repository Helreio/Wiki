# It’s okay to inflict pain if you are unconscious about it

Here’s a vegan argument.

Why is it the case that some animal rights activists believe that when an animal kills a man for food it is bad but forgiveable, but not as bad as when a man kills an animal for food?

An argument can be made that man’s killing of an animal for food is bad because he has the mental capacity to see that what he is doing causes pain. And intentionally causing pain or suffering against a life form is deemed wrong.

When an insane person kills, it is forgiveable, at least according to law, because an insane person does not have the mental capacity to see that they are causing pain.

An insane person is in a sense like an animal.

In human society, it’s okay to inflict pain if you are unconscious about it.

But that is the point. This belief only stands by societal convention. Morality is a fiction and we are creating more confusion when we use moral language. There are [[Practical alternatives to morality]].

Questions

- However, if our goal is not to inflict pain and suffering, aren’t we also influcting pain when we eat plants?
- If something cannot feel pain, is it a license to kill it?
