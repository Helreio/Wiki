# 2021-03 Monthly report

# Summary

This month, I celebrated Lea’s birthday by preparing a gamified celebration that involved numerous activities that cultiminated to our trip to Lipa at Candlelight Cafe with Rem and Claire. It was Lea and I’s first roadtrip since the pandemic. I continued to bond with friends. I saw the Salungguhit exhibit at Umali museum with Pearl and the gang. I also deepened my relationship with Diwa by babysitting her cats. Through her, I met Cristian and his friends (Jed my favorite, Paolo, Alfonso, Jael, and the others). Through their project, I was able to talk about my own journey in art during the pandemic for the CCP archives. I also met and built relationship with my neighbors like Tito Jun and Ate Daisy. This month, I transitioned to becoming a father of two cats. I brought Shorty and Champy home then had them seen by a vet at the UP Vet Hospital. I also made big progress in fixing my financial system by learning about investing and applying at eToro. Since my reflux was still bothering me, I implemented Don Daniel’s program and improved my digestion. This month marked the 10 year anniversary of my depressive episode, so I continued writing the depression vignettes.
