Does anything surprise you?

These words stood out:

- Writer

- Spirit

**Step 4: Your goals for the course.**

**What do you hope to achieve with this course?**

I plan on re-starting a blog + newsletter that I can commit on doing really well. A blog that specifically exists to serve my ideal audience, to push through a mission that I want to be known for, and hopefully propel me to write books and or create digital products that are for my audience.

**What do you want to be known for? What topics call you to write?**

Right now I want to be 3 kinds of people:

1. I want to be a freelancer so I can make money in a way that allows me to have a measure of freedom.
2. I want to pursue my multipotentiality by pursuing different projects and showcasing them on my site.
3. And I want to serve others through championing a mission, addressing a pain, and serving others.

The topics I want to write about:

Revolve around the question: “How can we live better?"

I definitely want to write nonfiction so my topics will be:

1. Nonconventional career development
2. Minimalism
3. Mindfulness
4. Creativity
5. Social change
1. Sustenance
2. Self Care
3. Social Change

Nature.

Self.

1. Career & Money
2. Health

Others.

**What is a reasonable amount of writing to do each week for you and your current schedule? How much writing would you like to do, both during this course, and after this course?**

I can write in my journal every day.

I am thinking about publishing on my blog 2x a month.

I would like to do as much writing as I feel like doing whenever.

But I also want to make a commitment to others by writing regularly for them and also a commitment to myself by expressing myself in writing every day (but this is a habit I need to work on)

**Fill in the blank: If I could do a good job helping others through my writing, I’d be so happy.**

**The one thing that would make my thought leadership feel so much better is if I can feel both good doing it and give value to others at the same time.**

**It seems silly, but I’m interested in reading and writing about:**

# *Lesson 02: Setting Parameters + Defining Your Topics*

Key Takeaways

- Pick one tool that works well for you and be consistent.
- Smaller, more specific, and finished is always better.
- Do your best work in the way that best suits you.
- 6 clear, articulate essays with evergreen, lasting content listed and linked clearly in your website + add 2 essays annually to that collection as side project to your main body of work
- Thought leadership = few carefully crafted pieces that you can use time and time again
- Set a pre-arranged number of dates (or essays).
- Successful projects have clear deliverables, clear expectations, and defined starting and ending dates.
- Defining the scope of your project as a limited number of essays will relieve an immense amount of psychological pressure.
