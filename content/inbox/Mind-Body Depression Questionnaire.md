# Depression: A Slow Leak in the Basement or a Dramatic Tornado?

Depression hit me like a dramatic tornado.

It was triggered by the ending of my relationship with a woman.

However, I would also want to note that I was already suffering from OCD even before my depression hit me.

I had OCD since I was a child and I also possess some very melancholic personality traits.

Therefore, I would say that although depression hit me suddenly, I do have the raw materials for a tragedy like this.

Guilt was the first sign of depression.

This dislike of myself.

This hatred towards myself.

Because I was doing something against what I believed as a JW.

And that pained me.

I should feel pain, I thought back then.

Because if I wasn’t, I was being unholy.

My physical and psychological health during that time before depression stroke was also really bad.

Depression caused me to be less tolerant to stress.

I easily feel fatigued every day.

My mind is blurred in the evening.

It also caused me to gain weight easily and to develop some bad eating habits.

Mentally, I’ve grown negative and irritable.

I also lost a lot of confidence in myself and what I could achieve.

This has influenced my dealings with others.

I am more isolated to people now than before.

Although one reason for this isolation is my desire to find the right people, I know deep inside that I’ve grown less and less social in recent years.

I also am easily irritated and I can be very resentful.

Depression caused me to loose all the spirituality that I once had.

I did the hard work of regaining that back and now I have a sense of purpose after what happened.

I just have to channel and harbour that motivation to change and heal.

Interventions that have been successful were:

Creativity

Travel

Nature

Meditation

Mindfulness

Sleep
