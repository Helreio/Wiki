# Don’t track every single investment

[[Your Money or Your Life]] does not advise tracking every single investment. It only advises that we multiply our investment with the most conservative investment rate (4%) and plot that in our chart whenever we are ready to invest.

The point where our investments crosses over our expenses line is the crossover point—the time we are financially free.
