# Tukod: A Guide to Simple Living

MAIN PURPOSE

The main purpose of this guide is to show how simple living can be used to buy more time for a particular passion, or better yet, a mission.

WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT YOU

You have an avocation, in the process of knowing it.

You want to focus

LINE OF IDEAS

Material things, is one of two things that support a particular mission. The other support is Health.

Picture a sitao seedling.

It need poles to grow.

What these two things (material and health) support is the organism that creates the mission. They allow the flourishing of the mind.

Health will not be the focused of this guide.

A person’s time in a lifetime is finite.

Therefore, a person’s time in a lifetime is a scarce resource.

Indicate exact number of hours, days, etc. in a person’s average lifespan.

Work and rest divides a person’s time.

Work is activity.

Rest is inactivity.

There are three kinds of work: (a) work to take care of the body, (b) work to satisfy the material needs of oneself, (c) and work to satisfy one’s pursuit of meaning (an avocation).

Each kind of work demands two things from the person: (a) the time to engage with it and (b) the willpower to do it.

For every work, there is a sufficient amount of time and willpower that it requires to flourish.

If a particular kind of work is to be given the sufficient amount of time and willpower it requires, time and willpower allotted to other kinds of work must be decreased.

The sufficient amount of time and willpower dedicated to a specific work is sufficient if it accomplishes the very minimum requirement for achieving its purpose.

A good life is a life that satisfies all of the minimum requirements of each kind of work.

Man’s needs follow a hierarchy. Therefore, man’s work follow a hierarchy.

The hierarchy of man’s work does not mean that more time should be dedicated to those on top, only that they are prerequisites for those below the hierarchy.

A good life is a life that satisfies the sufficient amount of material things that one needs, so that one could spend more time pursuing what gives meaning to one’s life.

To achieve this good life, one needs to follow a model.

We have a collection of tools we can use to create our own, subjective personal model.

Monetization

Investing

Gifting_Donation-based_Patron

Community and relationship building

Volunteering

Skill building and sharing

Gardening (or growing one’s own food)

Minimalism

These tools could intersect with each other.

By volunteering, one builds relationships with people.

These tools can be combined to create a personal model.

The money made from monetizing a passion can then be invested.

One who has freed up some time from monetizing his passion, could then spend some time volunteering

A personal model does not need to be static. It could change as one grow. An initial model could be very different from the next model.

The goal of any efficient personal system is to free up “more” (not less) time for avocations, passions, what make people sing.

An efficient system that frees up more time is therefore a system that has less time for (a) paid work and (b) unnecessary work - work that is not aligned to one’s values, goals.

A personal model that is complicated, that is filled with unnecessary work, and does not create enough “free time” defeats the purpose.

On the other hand, a personal model that is simple, creates more free time.

A personal model could still be heavily money dependent but is able to create more time.

However, a personal model that is heavily money dependent is not necessarily ecologically friendly (see Appendix A). One can be free from paid work

In creating a personal model that generates enough “free time,” one needs to choose the right kinds of tools and combinations.

These tools could be divided between those that are “more money dependent” and those that are “less money dependent”

The less one depends on money, the more one depends on non-monetary source of material or survival needs.

If one does not choose to monetize his passion, the passion will remain without any intention to profit. The person is then necessitated to look for other sources of material needs.
