# The Poet Looks at His Comrades, The Nameless Vegetation

It took a long long time to finally come here.

And as I look at these humble vegetation

Which are alive but which I will never be friends with

Them who didn't evolve

Who are waiting still for their own turn

Or maybe not

Maybe they don't need to

I look at them

And remember

Where I came from

Is still, until now,

A miracle.
