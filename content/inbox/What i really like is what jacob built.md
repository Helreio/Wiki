# What i really like is what jacob built

His lifestyle is what i want

It doesnt need fame or endless growth

Thats not what i want

And theres nothing wrong about not wanting those things

If i am going to start a business, i want it to be the right one. I still want to separate it from my ART

I want to build a business but not something i'm too passionate about. Just an instrument towards freedom
