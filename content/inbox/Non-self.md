# Non-self

According to [[Buddhism]], the self is simply an everyday conglomerate of various functions that change at any given time. They argue that a thing that constantly changes loses its identity.

I argue that the thing has an identity every time it occured and existed.

Western philosphy argues that man has an essence, a self, a mind, a soul that is unchanging.
