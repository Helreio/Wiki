# On Robert D. Richardson and the Art of Excavating Other People’s Lives

a writer who sought out and built scaffolding for the possibilities of self-transformation—his own and his readers’.

he did not start the activity of life-writing until he was over 40, and did not publish his first biography until the age of 52. This change in focus was spurred by earlier disappointments, but as he moved forward, seeking a new way, he also was not entirely aware of what he was doing. He did not wake up one day and decide to write a biography, but instead looked back and found he was already well along that path—and seeing this, put on the right shoes and carried onward.

1) “There’s nothing as out-of-date as fast as yesterday’s newspaper or last year’s critical thought.” 2) “I really don’t need this wall of theory in between me and the books I love.” And 3) “I want to write for somebody besides the professors. I don’t want to ignore them, or be ignored by them, but they’re not the exclusive audience.”

He wanted to write for the broadest audience: the general reader.

there was no line between writing literature and writing about literature.

Richardson took 9 years to write his biography of Thoreau.

he approached his reading as a quest for help

He became, as he later described Emerson, “a person who expects his reading to be useful above all,” and carried this notion of helpfulness into his own writing as a mandate. “The question for a biography,” he declared, “should be, ‘is it useful?’ ” He had noticed that in Bate’s biographies “every page offered up a usable truth, in do-it-yourself language,” and he adopted that principle, even if it was for something as seemingly small as instructions on how to effectively read poetry aloud.

He had come to see the study of the past as potentially “liberating, encouraging, empowering,” leading the reader to a place, he hoped, where “the question is not what is there left for me to do, but rather, what is it going to take to do what I want to do?”

“His whole life is about … how you remake yourself after some kind of disaster…. This man has become the great writer about hope, about rebuilding oneself, about the regenerative possibilities of the soul and the heart.”

you can do it now, you can do it here, you can do it anywhere.

The most life-giving part of Richardson’s Emerson is that he gives readers back their own selves. “His lifelong search,” Richardson said, “what he called his heart’s inquiry, was, ‘Whence is your power?’ His reply was always the same: ‘From my nonconformity.’ ” Emerson called on readers “to go alone, to refuse the good models.” He did not ask readers to follow him, but to use whatever hope and energy they take from him to find a new path. “Refuse, then, even Emerson,” Richardson said.

A focus on self-transformation, without a larger sense of one’s obligations to society, would be narcissistic, but for Richardson, the larger purpose of self-transformation was to turn around and use that same process and those same energies for social reform, to take away barriers and make the opportunities of personal transformation more available to everyone through the transformation of society. “The decisions we make about how to live,” he wrote, are ballots we cast “for a particular kind of world.”

“Anything that’s working to improve the world to a pattern that doesn’t yet exist is a form of practical idealism,” he said. “And the Transcendentalists were nothing if not practical idealists.

every single one of them began in the study … [and] ended up in some practical social endeavor.” This group, “impatient with the ordinary forms of social life,” became activists

In James, Richardson located an explanation of society’s root problem, which he summarized as “our absolute inability to understand the motives of people unlike ourselves.” We feud in comment threads and holiday dinner tables, talking endlessly at each other and seldom feeling heard or understood. The reason people are unsuccessful in changing others’ minds, James said, is that “they fail to realize the full inwardness of the situation.” And so, when people argue, they should “enter more deeply into the aesthetical and ethical point of view of their opponents.” If people feel listened to, they are more likely to listen, to empathize, to change. The way forward as a society, Richardson and James proposed, is to truly try to listen, and let that trying guide our responses to others. In empathy is our salvation.

It may sound grandiose to say that literature can change social circumstances, but his whole life was devoted to the idea that literature can change a person and a person can change society.

“it is only a short step to a belief in the power of imagination to place before us the world we most want.” But again he links the making of a better world, personal or communal, with the starting point of acceptance, quoting Rumi: “The moment you accept what troubles you’ve been given, the door opens.” From this sad but stable ground, he posits, an abiding peace can be imagined, and then built.
