# Sea Change Healthy Eating

# *Healthy Eating Overview Video*

Welcome to the Healthy Eating Habit module!

Today, I give an overview of our approach this month, in the above video.

In this overview, I discuss:

- My story of dieting, unhealthy eating, and becoming a healthy eater
- Why diets don’t work
- What a healthy lifestyle might look like (including French fries and beer!)
- What to expect in this month’s module

# *The Healthy Eating Habit Plan*

As we discussed in the [Healthy Eating Habit Overview](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/healthy-eating-overview/), we’re going to take a gradual approach during this module, with small changes.

This approach works whether you have lots of change to make (like I did in 2005, when I was really unhealthy) … or if you’re already pretty healthy but just have a few things you’d like to improve.

Here’s how it will work:

1. Pick one small, easy change from the lists below to start with.
2. Make a simple habit plan ( [read more](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/master-plan/) ) to stick to that habit this week.
3. At the end of the week, review how your change went. If you had obstacles, come up with a possible solution and add it to your habit plan.
4. If you did well by the end of the week, pick a 2nd habit to try for the next week. If you didn’t do well, either make an adjustment and try the same change, or pick another change you think will be easier.

And we’ll repeat this process each week this month.

### The Lists of Small Changes

I can’t possibly come up with an exhaustive list of healthy eating changes you might make, but here’s a series of lists to get you started. You should feel free to make other changes, but just don’t do anything too big.

The main criteria for picking one of these changes are these: 1) does the change seem both healthy and enjoyable? and 2) does it seem easy?

If you say yes to all of that, then it’s a great pick. If it seems easy but not necessarily enjoyable, that’s still OK.

1. Adding healthy things:
- Eat one vegetable at lunch/dinner (pick one meal)
- Add one more vegetable to lunch/dinner (pick one meal)
- Eat fruit for breakfast
- Eat fruit and raw nuts for a snack
- Eat veggie with hummus for a snack
- Eat a healthy protein for dinner/lunch
- Have yogurt for breakfast
- Have a tofu scramble with veggies for breakfast
- Drink green tea in the morning or afternoon (pick one)
- Add whole grains to your meals.
2. Changing your approach:
- Learn a couple new recipes this week
- Eat at home more (add a couple of nights to whatever amount you normally eat at home)
- Decide on healthy items to order before you go out to eat with friends.
- Bring healthy food to a pot-luck party or work gathering.
- Cook your healthy food in big batches and eat during the week.
- Eat slowly and stop before you’re full.
- Don’t eat after 8 p.m.
- Set portion sizes and try sticking to them.
- Don’t eat if you’re not actually hungry.
- Try for high-volume, lower-calorie foods: vegetables, beans, fruits rather than white starches, meats, and fried foods.
3. Cutting out unhealthy things (look at what you do now, and set a target that’s lower):
- Eat fruit instead of one of the sweets you normally eat.
- Drink tea instead of soda.
- Drink coffee with less or no sugar.
- Cut back on the number of alcoholic drinks you have by one.
- Eat less pastries, bread and other white flour.
- Eat less fried foods.
- Switch from white rice to brown rice.
- Eat less fast food.
- Bring a healthy lunch to work instead of eating fast food.
- Try Ezekiel flourless cereal instead of sweet cereal.
- Switch from processed meats (sausages, bacon, etc.) to real meat, or fish.
4. Vegan stuff (a few people asked for some suggestions):
- Try eating one meal a day with no meat.
- Reduce dairy or egg intake (use soymilk on your cereal, for example).
- Try cooking with tofu, tempeh, or seitan.
- Try some awesome lentil recipes.
- If it sounds easy and you’re already used to vegan food, try the [7-Day Vegan Challenge](http://7dayvegan.com/).

As I said, this list isn’t exhaustive, nor is every change listed above for everyone. Find changes that feel right to you, as I know not everyone agrees with everything I’ve listed.

# *Why Eat a Healthy Diet?*

That question might seem too obvious — we all know that a healthy diet is something we want!

But it’s worth exploring, at least briefly, because when push comes to shove, most people don’t really seem to want the healthy diet. They want the benefits (good health, looking lean and hot) but not the actual eating of the healthy food. Instead, most people want to eat pizza and fries and donuts, and still be super healthy with rock-hard abs.

So we need to go deeper into the Why.

And we need to think about how we can make that diet something we love, not something that feels like we’re being saintly while putting ourselves through self-torture. Because if there’s anything I’ve learned from my successful (and unsuccessful) habit changes, it’s that self-torture is a bad recipe for lasting change.

Give me a few minutes, and I’ll going to make my case for a healthier diet.

**Awesome Reason #1: It’s an act of self-compassion**. Eating healthy food isn’t about looking better (though it can help with that) … it’s about feeling better. And taking care of yourself. Just as you might shower so you don’t feel dirty, or brush your teeth so you don’t have bad breath and rotten teeth … you should eat well so you don’t feel sick. You don’t feel low on energy, which affects everything else around you. Taking care of yourself is a compassionate act.

**Awesome Reason #2: My dad just died, guys**. I don’t mean to be light-hearted about such a sad topic, nor do I want to play the sympathy card. But my time with my dad in the hospital as I watched him die was a stark reminder of what we do to our bodies when we don’t eat well, for years. It might seem like something that’s too distant to worry about, but my dad was 62, and that’s not that old. He drank and ate poorly and didn’t exercise while being diabetic, which really wasn’t smart, but he had built up bad habits for years and never really put the effort required to change them.

Seeing someone in such a condition, especially someone you love, is a very visceral illustration of what happens if you don’t take care of yourself. Life is too short to waste it with bad health.

**Awesome Reason #3: It’s Delicious**. While you might not think vegetables are the heigh of deliciousness … they truly can be. While you might think pastries and fried chicken and French fries and pizza are delicious … in another light, they aren’t.

Let me explain: what you think is delicious right now is partly a product of conditioning, what you’re used to. Of course, sweet and fatty and salty things are hardwired into us to taste good, but the level at which we enjoy these things and can tolerate them can be changed. I know this because of my own experience.

I slowly changed my taste buds over the years, so that now I still might enjoy some fried foods, if I eat too much of them I start to feel gross, bloated, greasy. They aren’t nearly as appealing to me as they used to be. And vegetables and other healthy foods are much, much more appealing to me now than they used to be. It took a long time to change, but I did it gradually, and I enjoyed myself along the way.

Today, I enjoy a good salad, but also a stir fry with tempeh and broccoli, kale, mushrooms, spinach, bell peppers, onions, and olive oil. I barely season these things — a light dash of salt and pepper — and I can really taste the deliciousness of these fresh vegetables. Add some avocado and I’m in heaven.

While I still love a good (vegan) pastry, I much prefer some dark chocolate and berries. Or just fruit. I love a snack of raw nuts and dried fruit, or a cup of unsweetened green tea. This food is part of an amazing lifestyle, and it’s awesome.

A healthy diet is worth pursuing, gradually, because it’s an act of compassion, because life is too short to waste being sick, and because it tastes so good that it truly rocks.

# *What Does a Healthy Diet Look Like?*

There are so many definitions of what’s healthy — low-fat, low-carb, Paleo, vegan, Mediterranean, raw, and so on. It can be downright confusing.

While I risk making a lot of people mad by writing this article, I’m going to attempt to synthesize my personal research on healthy eating. This isn’t definitive, and I’m not a nutritionist, but I’ve been exploring a healthy diet and have read hundreds of articles on this, sorting the good from the bad.

Here’s what I believe is healthy.

### Overall Principles

A diet is healthy if it gives your body nutrients it needs, without giving you too many calories (too many calories leads to obesity over time) or unhealthy things (like saturated or trans fat, nitrates, excess sodium, unhealthy chemicals). This definition is for the long term, not day to day. On any given day, you could have less nutrients than you need, and too many calories and sodium, but if the diet balances out over time, then it can be healthy.

So healthy food contributes to that: a good nutrient-to-calorie ratio without a lot of the bad stuff.

What kind of nutrients does your body need? It needs essential amino acids (protein), healthy fats, some carbs for energy, and a bunch of vitamins and minerals like iron, calcium, Vitamin D, sodium, potassium, and so forth. Fiber is good too, and of course you need water. This obviously isn’t a complete list.

If a food gives you some of those nutrients, without a lot of empty calories, it’s probably healthy. For example, [spinach](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2626/2) gives you Fiber, Protein, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin E (Alpha Tocopherol), Vitamin K, Thiamin, Riboflavin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Copper and Manganese and more. Without giving you a lot of calories or unhealthy things.

But half a loaf of bread might give you a bunch of calories without too many nutrients (maybe a bit of protein and a few other vitamins). These are empty calories, and we want less of those.

Everything, though, is fine in moderation. You can eat bread without guilt if it’s just a smaller part of your diet, and the rest of your diet is full of nutrient-dense stuff. If your diet is mostly empty calories, that’s not healthy.

### Nutritious Foods

With that in mind, here’s an incomplete list of foods I think are amazingly healthy:

1. **Greens**. Green leafy vegetables are the nutrient kings. They contain a ton of great vitamins and minerals, lots of fiber, not a lot of calories or other unhealthy things. Good examples: kale, spinach, broccoli, bok choy, mustard greens, green bell peppers, romaine lettuce.
2. **Red, yellow & orange fruits & veggies**. These colorful veggies add nutrients you won’t get as much elsewhere, like lycopene, potassium, vitamin C and beta-carotene (vitamin A). Good examples: carrots, squash, tomatoes, red and yellow bell peppers, sweet potatoes, squash, pumpkin, corn. Plus fruits: mangos, oranges, apricots, bananas, papaya.
3. **Onions & garlic**. I put these in all kinds of meals, and they have been shown to have cancer-protection properties.
4. **Beans and such**. Lentils, black beans, red beans, white beans, peas, mung beans — lots of fiber and minerals and protein. I absolutely love a good lentil soup or black bean burger or chili with various kinds of beans.
5. **Nuts & seeds**. Healthy fats and proteins — walnuts, almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, quinoa.
6. **Proteins**. As a vegan, I get my protein from plants — vegetables and whole grains have protein, but you can get lots of it in tofu, tempeh, seitan, soymilk. If you’re not vegan, I recommend fish and poultry, with red meat in moderation (it’s been shown to increase risks of cancer, for example, especially processed red meats like sausage, bacon and corned beef).
7. **Fruits**. Some people are afraid of fruits because they have sugar, but I’ve found them to be extremely healthy, and they satisfy my sweet cravings. My favorites: berries, apples, stone fruit (like peaches, apricots, plums), tropical fruits (mangos, papayas, starfruit, bananas, coconut).
8. **Healthy fats**. Our bodies need healthy fats, and polyunsaturated fats are especially healthy and seem to lower risks of heart attacks and certain cancers. Good sources: walnuts, canola oil, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, chia seeds, olive oil, fish, avocados, whole grain wheat, flaxseed oil, soybeans.
9. **Whole grains**. Some people shy away from grains, but I’ve found them super healthy when they aren’t ground into flour. So I’ll eat Ezekiel flourless breads and cereals, but also brown rice, steel-cut oats, amaranth, and quinoa (which isn’t technically a grain). There are lots of other traditional grains to try. And whole-grain flour isn’t bad in moderation.
10. **Dairy and/or soy**. As a vegan, I tend not to advocate dairy, but there’s no doubt we need calcium and vitamin D, and dairy provides those as well as protein. I drink soymilk, which gives me the same things (along with Vitamin B12, which vegans need).
11. **Drinks**. Avoid sugary drinks and too much alcohol. Black coffee (or with a splash of cream), tea, green juice, and a glass of red wine are all great. And water is best!

Oh, and mushrooms are super healthy! I’ve probably forgotten 10 other healthy foods, btw.

**Moderation**: You should base your diet on the list above, but you can always have other foods in moderation. White rice, white breads, white potatoes, sugars, fried foods, fatty foods, red meats … these can all be a part of a healthy diet. I’ll have pancakes now and then, but it’s not my main breakfast. And a good muffin is wonderful!

There aren’t any “bad” foods … it’s all about including whatever treats you want into an overall picture of a healthy diet.

**A note on veganism**: While you will hear me talk about being vegan, I should note that I don’t think you need to be a vegan to be healthy. And not all vegans are healthy. I’ve found that you can be *very* healthy as a vegan, the same way you can with any other diet: eat lots of healthy foods from the list above. But I do it mostly for [reasons of compassion](http://zenhabits.net/vegan/) and the environment.

### A Healthy Diet

Taking the big picture into account, here’s what I would gradually progress towards:

Eat mostly whole foods, mostly healthy foods from the list above.

For breakfast, Ezekiel flourless whole grain cereal with soymilk and berries and nuts, or [steel-cut oats](http://7dayvegan.com/chock-full-oatmeal/) with berries and nuts, or yogurt (soy or milk) with berries and nuts. Or some fruit with whole-grain toast and almond butter. Or a [tofu scramble](http://7dayvegan.com/scrambled-tofu/) with lots of veggies.

For lunch and dinner, the possibilities are endless, but I tend to aim for something with protein, lots of veggies, and healthy fats, with a touch of whole grains. Some examples:

- [Veggie chili](http://7dayvegan.com/chili/) with three kinds of beans and lots of veggies cooked in.
- Lentil soup with coconut milk, greens and carrots.
- Tofu, tempeh or seitan [stir-fry](http://7dayvegan.com/tofu-veg-stir-fry/) (or some kind of meat if you’re not vegan) with olive oil, onions, garlic, mushrooms, green veggies.
- Beans and brown rice and a side of steamed green veggies.

The stir-fry is my go to meal, and has been for awhile.

I have coffee in the morning, green tea or oolong tea in the afternoon, and red wine at night.

With that healthy base in mind, you should feel free to indulge in pizza, croissants, muffins, a veggie burger (or the regular kind) with fries without guilt, as long as the lion’s share of your diet is healthy.

# *Changing Eating Habits Flexibly*

One of the most common mistakes people make when trying to change their eating habits is to collapse after messing up.

You go to a party and tell yourself you’re going to be good, and eat healthy food … and then you have a few chips. Oh no! The plan failed! So now you feel bad, and give up … why not have a beer? And then two? And while you’re at it, some more chips and a bunch of cake.

The first failure — eating a few chips — wasn’t that bad, and in fact a healthy lifestyle can include eating chips in moderation. The problem wasn’t the chips or the failure, it’s the response to the failure. We feel like we failed, and then we give up. We say, “Oh well, I already messed up, so messing up some more won’t make a difference.”

That’s not true, though. Messing up a little is totally fine. But a complete collapse, followed by a few days of eating with abandon … that’s not as good. And it sets up a pattern that will be repeated fairly often.

So what can we do instead? Take a more flexible approach.

### A Flexible Approach

The mindset when we’re changing our eating habits should not be: “I’m going to do this perfectly. Things are going to go according to plan.” That’s a rigid approach that expects perfection, and is not realistic.

Instead, a more flexible mindset is useful: “I’m going to try to follow this plan, but I don’t know exactly how it will go, and I’m going to learn along the way. I expect bumps in the road, and will learn from them.” This is a learning mindset, an open approach, and one that allows for flexibility.

So here’s how it might work:

1. **Pick something super easy**. Too many people try to do too much when they’re changing their eating habits, and this put a huge burden on them to be perfect with the habit change. Not realistic. Instead, try something very easy that you know you can stick to. Let yourself succeed, and let yourself adjust to this as your new “normal”.
2. **Know that there will be bumps**. Don’t go in hoping to be perfect — know that there will be unexpected missteps, obstacles you didn’t anticipate, urges that you just won’t overcome for some reason. This is a more realistic approach, and if you anticipate things going differently than you planned, you aren’t as likely to just give up when that happens.
3. **Be mindful, & when there’s a bump, learn from it**. It’s helpful to be mindful as you eat, and especially when you approach challenging situations like a bunch of unhealthy food at a work function or a holiday party. Watch yourself as you enter this environment, and see what urges and rationalizations come up. See what happens when you eat something that you didn’t plan to eat. Breathe, and then learn from the rationalizations and obstacles you encounter. Learn from the missteps. Write this stuff down.
4. **Make adjustments**. Change your habit plan to accommodate these obstacles and rationalizations. What will you try differently next time? Also, if you didn’t do so well this past week with your eating change, adjust and make it easier. Or try a different eating change that won’t be as challenging, and come back to this harder one later.

This is the flexible process that leads to long-term change. It’s not easy, but the inflexible approach isn’t easy either, because it leads to a pattern where you fail and give up, repeatedly over time. Choose flexible instead.

# *Webinar Recording: Tips for the Healthy Eating Habits*

In this webinar, I shared a recent couple days of unhealthy eating, and how I dealt with it. Then I shared the following tips:

1. Don’t diet. How many of you have tried a diet? How many of you are still on it? How many did it after 3 or 4 months?
2. Instead, change normal gradually.
3. When you’re tired, you don’t eat well.
4. Make choices when you’re rational.
5. Start to learn what makes you feel good and bad. Calculate net value.
6. Change your environment.
7. Adopt a flexible mindset — one or two unhealthy days won’t kill you … the important thing is learning and starting again.
8. See when your mind rebels.
9. Be driven by learning and love, not dissatisfaction.
10. Find ways to address your bad feelings other than eating.
11. Re-learn social habits. And travel habits.
12. Slow is your friend.

Then I answered some questions from members, including:

- What can you say about being “addicted” to sugar. I went without much sugar this week and felt terrible. Is it normal to have this feeling and will it go away in time?
- Like you I count my macros very closely and find myself eating a lot of the same home cooked meals over and over – chicken, oats, sweet potatoes, broccoli, kale. I try to mix it up with a few meals from something fermented, some bone broth, and organ meats each week, but I worry that by eating essentially the same meal every day I am missing some critical micronutrients in my diet. How do you handle eating the same meals every day while ensuring you are getting all the various nutrients you need?
- I can’t find the open thread on the healthy eating module. Can you post the URL to that on the landing page? ( [It’s here](http://seachange.zenhabits.net/forum/index.php?/topic/3623-healthy-eating-open-team-2015-all-welcome/).)
- Are you not worried that making batches will lead to overheating or the food will loose its nutritional value (because I am keeping it for a long time in fridge).
- Have you ever had to deal with peer pressure over making long term changes (vs a wholesale change)? If so, how have you responded to that?
- Do your family eat the same diet than you? if no how do you deal with the different diets?
- I wondered… has anyone ever exerted pressure on you from the other direction e.g. ‘why aren’t you just cutting out everything or going on this or that diet?’
- Could you share a bit about your take on coffee in terms of health. Its a conflictive subject, many people regard it to be very unhealthy.

# *Adjusting Your Habit, or Starting a New One*

We’re about a week into the Healthy Eating Habit module, and you now have some data you didn’t have at the beginning. Let’s take a look at what we can learn from it.

Here are some common outcomes, and what I recommend for each:

- **Did great (6-7 successes in a week)**: You were pretty much perfect, and your habit went great. That means you picked a perfect habit to start with! Now pick another similarly easy habit that you can add to the first one. Make it so easy you don’t have any doubts of doing great.
- **Did well (4-5 successes)**: You made some good progress but had a few misses. Celebrate your successes! And take note of what got in the way when you didn’t do the habit. What can you do differently this week? My recommendation for this week: Make your first habit even easier (so you’ll be sure to succeed), and if you can do that, you can also add a second super easy habit. If there’s no way to make your first habit so easy it’s guaranteed to succeed, don’t add a second habit. Just focus on getting better at the first.
- **You struggled (3 or fewer successes)**: You’re probably feeling a bit guilty or bad about yourself for this, but actually it’s a cause for celebration too … because you learned something. What you learned is that the change you picked is too hard. Choose something easier: drink a glass of water every day, eat a fruit every morning, take a pause sometime during your dinner to see how you’re feeling. Something simple and doable. This is an adjustment that will help you do better this week.

If you’re an **advanced healthy eater**, I’d like to make a suggestion: try eating for purely non-emotional reasons. Don’t eat because you feel like it, because you’re stressed or bored or in a social situation. Make a plan of what to eat, and just eat according to the plan. This cuts out any emotional ties from eating. This requires an advanced degree of mindfulness, and also a flexible mind, because there will likely be days when you mess up, and you need to be able to flow with that instead of feeling bad about it.

# *Eating Slowly & Mindfully*

One thing I’ve had to change about my mindset towards food is thinking of food as “good” or “bad”.

There are no bad foods — seeing foods as bad creates a phobia around them that can be unhealthy.

Instead, it’s more helpful to see food in terms of which ones should make up the bulk of your diet (vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds), and the ones that are more of a treat (sweets, fried foods, etc.). And to recognize that too much of the treats isn’t healthy.

With that mindset, how can we avoid eating too much of the treats? How can we avoid overeating in general?

I’ve found that slow, mindful eating is extremely useful.

Here are some ideas for eating slowly and mindfully:

1. When you eat, pay attention to how the food looks. This gives you visual information about your food that helps you from eating too much.
2. Pay close attention also to the texture, tastes, and smells of the food. Eat slowly and savor the food, whether it’s healthy vegetables (you can learn to enjoy them!) or the treats that should be smaller parts of your diet.
3. Don’t be afraid of the treats, but just eat a few bites, slowly and mindfully.
4. If you’re eating food that you usually eat too much of, try eating a bite, then putting the fork down. Chew the bite mindfully, swallow. Then breathe. Then pick up the fork and take the next bite. This will help you from overeating.
5. If you usually go back for seconds (or even thirds), don’t do it immediately. Wait 5-10 minutes after you finish your first serving before considering whether you want another. Often it takes awhile for your body to realize its full, so if you wait, you might realize you’re already sated. Try eating only to satiation, not to absolute fullness.
6. Take smaller portion sizes instead of loading up your plate. Eat the smaller amount slowly and it might be enough.
7. Eat the healthy stuff (vegetables, beans, fruits, etc.) first, slowly, and then allow yourself to savor a smaller amount of the treat of your choice.

# *Dealing with Eating in Social Situations and Travel*

Two of the most difficult situations for most people when it comes to mindful, healthy eating are social eating, and eating while traveling.

When you’re at a party, a work lunch meeting, eating with friends or family … it’s hard to be mindful of your eating, because you’re paying attention to people talking to you. How do you pay attention to two things at once? And because of this difficulty, we often overeat or drink too much.

Traveling has its own set of challenges: you don’t have your usual healthy options available, sometimes you have to grab a quick bite at somewhere convenient, other times you eat at places filled with rich, heavy or fried foods.

In this article, I’ll share some of my thoughts on dealing with these challenges.

### Social Eating

Social eating is one of my biggest ongoing challenges, and while I haven’t completely licked it, here are some things that have worked for me:

1. **Plan ahead**. Know that you will need to have more awareness of eating than usual, with the constant distraction of people talking to you. So remind yourself: be mindful! And constantly reminds yourself of this during the social gathering.
2. **Eat ahead**. Sometimes it’s smart to eat something healthy before you go, so that you have gotten your dose of veggies and protein, and won’t be lacking in nutrients at the social gathering, nor will you be incredibly hungry and tempted to stuff your face.
3. **Eat in small doses**. Some people tend to load up their plates or order lots of food at once, but this means that if you’re not paying attention to your eating, you’ll likely eat it all even if you’re already full. So take only small servings if possible, and then if you’re not mindful of your eating, you won’t do much damage by eating the entire serving.
4. **Have cues**. While you might not be able to pay close attention to your eating as you eat, you can remind yourself to notice when you’re done eating a small dose and are about to get more. So each time you’re about to get more food or drink, pause and think, “Why am I getting more? Am I actually hungry? Or am I eating/drinking to have something to do while I socialize?” Each refill becomes your mindfulness cue.
5. **Aim for healthier choices**. While you might be surrounded by a huge amount of junk food or rich, heavy food, there will usually be some healthy options — veggie sides, salad, water or tea instead of alcohol. You don’t need to only eat the healthy stuff, but you’re better off if you choose the healthy stuff most of the time.
6. **Indulge in small bites**. There’s no need to completely stay away from the treats, but you don’t need a ton of treats in order to satisfy a craving. If you feel like eating fried clams, fine, but just have one or two, and eat them slowly and fully savor them. Same thing with that molten chocolate cake — just take 2-3 bites, and savor them slowly.

### Traveling & Eating

How do you eat healthily while on the road or in the sky? It’s not as easy as sticking to your usual healthy routine, but it can be done without too much trouble. Here are some of my best techniques:

1. **Plan ahead**. Think through your options before you travel if possible, and do a little research to find healthy restaurants in the area you’re traveling to. Put them on a Google Map you create for your trip so you can easily find them later.
2. **Buy groceries**. Pretty much every place in the world has grocery stores, so if you can make a stop at one and buy some things for a healthy breakfast, you’ll have an inexpensive and healthy option to start your day at least.
3. **Make lunch your indulgence meal**. I like to eat at good restaurants when I travel, but doing it for every meal would be expensive and fattening. So I usually pick lunch as my indulgence meal, because you can get really good food at great restaurants for cheaper. Many good restaurants have a special set lunch menu or a buffet that aren’t available at dinner. I try not to overdo it at lunch, but if I do, I can usually walk it off by exploring the city I’m visiting.
4. **Eat a light dinner**. A quick sandwich, salad, falafel or similar can usually be picked up in a small food stand, or you can stop at a grocery and pick up a few things for a light dinner (baguette, fruit and wine in Paris!) that you can eat in a park or somewhere that shows of the beauty of the place you’re visiting.
5. **When socializing during travel**, follow the tips in the previous section. Eat ahead, eat in small doses, have cues, aim for healthier choices, indulge in small bites.

#### Recipe from Jules Clancy of [Stonesoup](http://thestonesoup.com/blog/2014/07/my-secret-to-being-an-organised-cook/)

*A tajine is just the Moroccan version of a stew. They come in all sorts of varieties but I particularly love this combo of chickpeas and sweet potato. The spices really bring this dish to life. If you can get your hands on the Moroccan spice blend ‘ras el hanout’ that’s great but if not see the variations for alternatives.*

> **takes:** 20 minutes

> **makes:** enough for 2

> serves 2

> 1 can chickpeas (400g / 14oz), drained

> 1 tablespoon ras el hanout (or see variations below)

> 1 can tomatoes (400g / 14oz)

> 2 small sweet potato, roasted (450g)

> 1 bunch coriander (cilantro)

1. Heat a medium pot on a medium heat. Add a little oil and cook chickpeas for a few minutes.
2. Add spice and cook another minute. a
3. Add tomatoes simmer uncovered for 10-15 minutes or until the sauce is reduced and thickened slightly.
4. Chop the sweet potato into chunks and add to the pot. Allow to warm through. Taste. Season.
5. Cool and store or serve with coriander on top.

## Variations

**no roasted sweet potato?** – replace with raw sweet potato cut into chunks. Simmer in the sauce with the lid on for 30 minutes or until sweet potato is cooked.

**no ras el hanout?** – replace with 1 tablespoon baharat (lebanese spice blend) or 1 teaspoon each of ground turmeric, coriander and ginger.

**home cooked chickpeas** – soak and cook chickpeas using the method for [a big pot of beans](http://stonesoupvirtualcookeryschool.com/2012/04/a-big-pot-of-beans/). You’ll need 240g (9oz) cooked chickpeas.

**different legumes** – replace chickpeas with 240g (9oz) cooked or canned lentils or beans.

**different herbs** – mint or basil are also lovely here. Or use baby spinach or some salad for the greenery.

**more veg** – feel free to add in whatever veg you feel like. If they need cooking, allow extra time to simmer in the sauce with the lid on.

**more protein** – serve with toasted pine nuts or almonds. Some cooked chicken or sausages can also be a nice addition.

**more authentic** – add in 1/4 [preserved lemon](http://stonesoupvirtualcookeryschool.com/2011/12/preserved-lemons/) finely sliced.

## Waste Avoidance Strategy

**chickpeas, ras el hanout, tomatoes** – pantry.

**roast sweet potato** – will keep in the fridge for a few weeks. OK to freeze.

**coriander (cilantro)** – best to use for another meal. Can be frozen but will wilt when defrosted.

# *Recipe: Falafels with Hummus*

![image_2.jpeg](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/1508CDA7-2D64-440A-AD95-40BFB5D9459D/204FEE99-A5B1-4A34-BD97-5AA4611DD9EA_2/image_2.jpeg)

#### Recipe from Jules Clancy of [Stonesoup](http://thestonesoup.com/blog/2014/07/my-secret-to-being-an-organised-cook/)

*The best falafels I ever had were in a tiny hole-in-the-wall workers restaurant in Amman, the capital of Jourdan. I still remember the place was so busy and when we got a table there was no discussion over what we wanted. The server just came with flat bread, hummus and crisp light falafels freshly fried in a giant pot out the front. So good. For home cooked falafels I prefer to cook them under the grill rather than mess around with deep frying. It’s quicker and for me far less intimidating. Yet still super tasty.*

> *enough for 2*

> 1 can chickpeas (400g / 14oz), drained

> 1 bunch flat leaf parsley

> 1 egg

> hummus, to serve

> baby spinach, to serve

1. Preheat your overhead grill (broiler) on high.
2. Whizz chickpeas and parsley in the food processor until finely chopped. Stir in the egg. Season.
3. Roll the mixture into small balls about the side of a quail egg. Place the falaels on an oiled tray and drizzle with more oil.
4. Grill for 5-7 minutes or until firm when touched. Serve hot falafels on a bed of hummus with baby spinach on the side.

## Variations

**more traditional** – serve with [tabbouleh salad](http://stonesoupvirtualcookeryschool.com/2013/07/quinoa-tabboule/) instead of the baby spinach.

**no food processor** – finely chop the parsley and mash together with the chickpeas using a fork.

**more substantial** – serve with warm pita bread or other flat bread on the side.

**carnivore** – brown some minced (ground) beef or lamb in a pan with a little oil. Sprinkle over the falafels before serving.

**vegan / egg-free** – try it without the egg. Traditional falafels don’t use egg so it should be Ok. I just prefer to use egg for the extra protein and the insurance that my falafels won’t fall apart.

**different legumes** – some places use butter beans or lima beans instead of chickpeas. And others use a combo of chickpeas and beans. Fresh shelled broad beans are another great option.

**home cooked chickpeas** – are great. You’ll need 250g (9oz) cooked chickpeas.

## Waste Avoidance Strategy

**chickpeas** – keep them in the pantry.

**flat leaf parsley** – tends to be the most long lasting of the leafy herbs. Should keep for a few weeks in the fridge if wrapped in a plastic bag. For longer periods pop it in the freezer – it will wilt but will still be useable in this dish.

**eggs** – will keep in th fridge for a month or so. Or use for another meal.

**hummus** – will keep in the fridge for a few weeks. Can be frozen.

**baby spinach** – either pop them in the freezer or wilt down in a covered pot with a little olive oil. This way they’ll keep in the fridge for a few weeks.

# *Recipe: Quinoa with Broccoli Pesto*

![image_3.jpeg](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/1508CDA7-2D64-440A-AD95-40BFB5D9459D/2794B6B2-25C8-4FE1-8A7C-836DC770E70D_2/image_3.jpeg)

#### Recipe from Jules Clancy of [Stonesoup](http://thestonesoup.com/blog/2014/07/my-secret-to-being-an-organised-cook/)

*Most weeks I either cook up a big pot of lovely lentils or quinoa to use during the week for breakfasts, lunches or dinners. I’ve also more recently been getting into grating raw veg like broccoli or cauliflower in the food processor and keeping it in the fridge for a quick veg hit to serve with my poached eggs in the morning or in a salad like this.*

*If you’re not a fan of raw broccoli, see the ‘more wintery’ variations below.*

> *Enough for: 2*

> *Takes: 10 minutes*

> 1 head broccoli

> 400g (14oz) cooked quinoa

> 6 tablespoons pesto

> squeeze lemon juice

> 8 tablespoons ricotta

1. Chop broccoli into small bite sized pieces or grate it using a box grater or your food processor.
2. Toss prepared broccoli in a bowl with the quinoa and pesto. Add lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Taste and add more salt / pepper / lemon, if needed.
4. Serve with ricotta on top.

## Variations

**to cook quinoa** – cook 200g (7oz) quinoa from scratch, just boil in a big pot of water like pasta for 10 minutes. Then drain and you’re good to go.

**warm salad / more wintery** – follow the ‘to cook quinoa’ instructions above and add broccoli to the cooking water after 5 minutes. Drain and toss in the pesto and lemon and serve warm with cold ricotta on top.

**carnivore** – toss in cooked chicken.

**carb lovers / more substantial** – increase the quinoa or serve pasta with the pesto.

**make your own pesto** – whizz one bunch basil leaves with 1 clove garlic, a handful pinenuts and large handful grated parmesan. Add enough extra virgin olive oil to make a chunky paste and season well with s&p.

**more veg** – toss in cooked peas.

**no quinoa?** – replace with any cooked grain or legume. Barley or brown rice would be my first choices.

**dairy-free / vegan** – replace ricotta with hummus or a drizzle of tahini and use a dairy-free pesto like this [Sicilian Nut Pesto](http://thestonesoup.com/blog/2010/11/knife-skills-how-to-chop-like-a-chef-5-ingredients-10-minutes/).

## Waste Avoidance Strategy

**broccoli** – will keep wrapped in a plastic bag in the fridge for about 2 weeks or sometimes a little longer. Can be frozen (if you have time chop before freezing so it will defrost quickly in the pan).

**quinoa** – dried keep in the pantry. Cooked quinoa can be frozen.

**pesto** – commercial jars of pesto will keep for months in the pantry. Fresh pesto will keep in the fridge for a few weeks. Cover with olive oil to prevent exposure to air and browning reactions.

**lemon** – whole lemon will keep wrapped in a plastic bag in the fridge for months.

**ricotta** – in a sealed tub it usually has a shelf life of a few weeks in the fridge. If in an opened container, will only keep for a few days so use for another meal or freeze.
