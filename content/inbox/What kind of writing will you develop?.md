# What kind of writing will you develop?

I want to write non-fiction prose primarily.

I want to write personal first-person essays.

I want to be able to present findings I discover from my studies—researches, quotes, stories, ideas, etc.)

I want to delve into deep questions.

I also want to write about ordinary subjects, as they related to the question “How to live?”

I want to be able to contribute my own thoughts and ideas to the questions or topics I eplore.

I want my writing to be practical—not necessarily in a “guide” tone but in a demonstrative tone where I just show how it can be applied.
