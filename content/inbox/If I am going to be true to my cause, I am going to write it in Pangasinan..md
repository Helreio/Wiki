# If I am going to be true to my cause, I am going to write it in Pangasinan.

Then translate it to another Filipino language.

If I start with English or Tagalog, then I won't go back to the smaller unit. I will be making compromises and will be jumbling names.

There has to be one language. And I won't choose Tagalog right now.

Pangasinan is calling me.
