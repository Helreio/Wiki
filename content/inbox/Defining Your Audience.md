# Defining Your Audience

**AUDIENCE**

The people giving or likely to give attention to something.

Your most valuable asset in your business.

Attention from your audience is the most precious resource in the planet.

**DEFINE**

1. This is actually quite hard to do.
2. Pick a specific audience (not everybody).

**3 Ds**

1. Discover
2. Decide
3. Do

**Discover**

1. Demographics
2. Psychographics
3. Nicheing Down
4. Combining Audiences

**Demographics**

- [ ] The large facts about your audience.
- [ ] Age, gender, income, location, disability, etc.

Example: Father Apprentice

- Men.
- Who are dads.
- Who are new dads.

   **Psychographics**

- [ ] Classification of people based on psychological criteria.
- [ ] Values, thoughts, attitudes, lifestyle, aspirations, etc.
- [ ] What do they care about?
- [ ] What’s their life like?
- [ ] What makes them tick?
- [ ] What is it like to walk a mile on their shoes?

**Nicheing Down**

- [ ] You have to niche down. The more specific you get, the more your audience will resonate with what you are saying.
- [ ] Specifying a group within a group.

Example: Father Apprentice

- Men.
- Who are dads.
- Who are new dads.
- Who work.
- Who are concerned about work/life balance.

   **Combine Audiences**

- [ ] Nerd Fitness

**Decide**

1. Is there a business opportunity here?
2. Can they pay?
3. Will they pay?

If the answers to these questions are NO, get back to the changing the characteristics of your audience so that you get more favourable answers.

**Do**

Make things for our newly defined audience or adjust current platform for them.

Not defining your audience or defining it wrongly are both dangerous.

Build feedback loops that can help you learn constantly from your audience and that can help you make natural corrections along the way.

---

**Service Mindset**

- [ ] Serve your audience. Don’t use them.
- [ ] I am the mentor who helps the hero defeat his enemy.
- [ ] Your audience is more important than you are.
- [ ] Your goal should be to get your people from point A to point B instead of converting them into a subscriber.

**Apprentice Mindset**

- [ ] Watch everything your audience does.
- [ ] Be in it in the long haul.
- [ ] Be an expert craftsman for your audience and do stuff for them.

**Visual Exercises**

Go get visual - Imagine going inside a room filled with your audience, then ask yourself: What do they look like?

Go get sketchy.

**What to do once your audience is defined**

Start making small changes in your site.

Make friends with your audience (blog, forum, guest post, etc.) in the next 30 days -learn, add value, and bring people to your site.

Follow people who already serve your audience.

Create content for your audience.

Create a feedback loop to know if you’re serving the right audience or not.

- [ ] Ask if you’re doing the right thing - survey, blog post

Set a 30-60 day time period to try this out and at the end of that time period see if how you’re doing.

- [ ] Ask yourself, does it feel right? We have less people but does it feel right?
