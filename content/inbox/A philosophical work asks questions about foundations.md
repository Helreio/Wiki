# A philosophical work asks questions about foundations

An important characteristic of philosophy (particularly [[Strict use of “philosophy”]]) is that it delves on foundational questions that aim to inquire about the basis of beliefs and frameworks in almost all aspects of life. This is the reason why we have philosophy of religion, ethics, science, education, culture, and society.

There are specialized [[Branches of philosophy]] that ask fundamental questions. A work is philosophical if it delves on the topics and problems existing in these branches of philosophy.

UNPROCESSED NOTES

So the discipline of philosophy is the study and analysis done on the foundations of beliefs and not the beliefs themselves. To refer to a belief as a philosophy is to use the word philosphy in the lenient sense.

Foundational questions are universal in nature. Philosophical questions are asked by an individual in the level of being a human and not being a Filipino.

Concrete or pesonal problems could cause a person to ask philosophical questions. But once asked, philosophical questions no longer just delve into the problem of a specific person but of humanity as a whole.

It is the philosopher who has a nationality, not the philosophy.

The ideas of philosophy, much like the ideas of mathematics and science, are universal. Therefore, their conclusions and applications applies to everyone whatever their nationality.
