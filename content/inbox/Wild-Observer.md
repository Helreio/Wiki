25 Highlights from Wild-Observer

Observation skills are at the core of every field of nature study

---

All through time it’s the people who have had the ability to notice, predict and make informed decisions that have led their people to success.

---

Every moment out in nature is an opportunity to know and understand more deeply the intricate web of patterns that cycle and recycle

---

If we can tune in and cultivate an understanding of the nature outside of us, we’ll also learn to connect with our own internal resources and ourselves more deeply

---

Well, when you’re tuned into a pattern out in nature it’s because you have a representation of that pattern in your mind.

---

If you understand generally what the beginning, middle & end of that pattern looks like then you can recognize each stage of the sequence and make accurate predictions about what comes next

---

By relating to the pattern as a single unit it gives us a feeling of simplicity & a sense of certainty about how all the pieces fit together

---

We need to understand that the process of observation is both an art and a science

---

So the key to taking your nature observation abilities to really deep levels actually lies in working with the science portion of this equation. If you learn to work with the science of observation then the art of observation will come as a natural result

---

And the way to do this is by using one of the most basic mental human faculties that everyone possesses… Counting!

---

making very concrete, numerical and ordinal observations about nature is extremely easy, it opens the doorway to less tangible forms of awareness, and surprisingly in a lot of cases it will actually give you less to think about rather than more, so your mind will actually be quieter while you’re outside & observing

---

It was the sum total of these very concrete observations that made it apparent there was a pattern repeating over and over again. The quantifiable nature of counting the various elements of this pattern made it possible for me to be absolutely certain about precisely what was taking place there.

---

Once you know how to do this then of course you’re not locked into working exclusively with scientific means. There is something to be said for hunches, impressions and feelings, which form the more artistic side of observation

---

counting is the key to training your mind & awareness to keep track of the most foundational and essential information, which will make it possible for you to really open up your senses and begin tracking the more complex patterns out in nature

---

Just sitting quietly on a park bench or in your backyard regularly will help you begin to anchor yourself in one place, and it gives you regular opportunities to practice rhythmic awareness.

---

Step 1 – Go outside and sit somewhere

---

When you arrive at your spot it’s a good idea to take a couple minutes to unwind and just relax into that space. Then when you feel ready… begin looking, listening for, & counting the repeating patterns of sound, behavior, & movement in the landscape

---

- [ ] What rhythms are occurring right now? - How often do they repeat? (Count the repetitions) - How long do they go on for? (Track the length of time) - What anomalies in the patterns can you detect? - What happens when they stop? - How long does it take before they start up again?

---

Whatever you decide to focus on, keep it simple for you. If it’s too challenging and you’re losing track of what you’ve chosen, maybe pick something easier and keep trying until you get it.

---

Step 2 - Do some reflecting

---

When you arrive home after your sit time, there are some other questions you can ask yourself in order to reflect on how the experience went for you and what you can do to improve your experience

---

This can be really helpful for orienting yourself to success with this process and rather than judging yourself for what you experienced I would encourage you to use this as another tool for increasing your awareness

---

Just notice what comes up for you and maybe have a notebook you can jot your ideas down in, or if you’re doing this with a friend you could have a discussion. As you do this more & more times you’ll find new insights occurring to you and you might even notice rhythms beginning to emerge in your own observations about doing this exercise

---

Here are the questions  How did working with the exercise change the quality of your awareness?  What was easy about this exercise?  What was challenging for you?  What did you notice & observe?  Were you able to stay focused through the whole sequence of a pattern or were there times when you zoned out and missed parts of it?  What do you want to focus on or improve next time?

---

Step 3 – Congratulate yourself
