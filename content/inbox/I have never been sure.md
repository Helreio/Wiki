# I have never been sure

I am not sure if there is anything after this

I have never been sure about a lot of things in my life

But what does one do when one is unsure?

Make use of whatever one trusts

No matter what level

And so I tell you what I trust

I trust that I am alive now

As I write these words

I trust that everything will halt one day

I trust that if everything halts,

Everything won't be the same

(If everything is still around then)

I trust that this present moment

Is truer than anything before

And after it

And I trust that if I don't pay attention to it

I will never see

The truth and beauty

That it offers me

I have never been sure of a lot of things

But I have always been sure to live

Today

Not tomorrow

Today
