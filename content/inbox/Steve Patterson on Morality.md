# Steve Patterson on Morality

Having the right intention is better than doing the right thing

Morality has nothing to do with actions

There is no right action to take

Whatâ€™s important is the intent

Different people could act differently on the same situation

Anything goes as long as your intention is pure

Truly having the right intention means you care about cause and effect, which means not acting out of ignorance

Morality is internal not external. It only appears external because people act in ways we like.

Actions flow from intentions.
