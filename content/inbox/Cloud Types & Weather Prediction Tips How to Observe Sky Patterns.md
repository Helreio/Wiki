# Cloud Types & Weather Prediction Tips: How to Observe Sky Patterns

What do you see?

What is that telling you?

Cloud patterns to look for:

- What shape?
- What direction is it coming from?
- How big is it?
- How high in the sky is it?

Basic questions

1. What type of cloud are you seeing?
   - Two main types:
      - Clumping clouds (Cumulus)

```other
* Layered clouds (Stratus)
* Lumping the numerous cloud types into these two major categories is the first step in this simple weather forecasting process.
```

2. What are the cloud characteristics?
   - How big?
   - Any signs of active growth?
   - How dark?
   - Examples:
      - Cumulus
         - Starts as small fluffs.

* Then they gain some depth.

```other
* They become bigger and darker.
```

```other
* Cumulonimbus (clumping raincloud) - summer rain when a big dark cloud suddenly rolls in when it’s hot, rains for a few minutes, then vanishes
	* Stratus clouds will actually take days before their rain moves in.
		* Day 1: Thin haze high in the sky. What you are seeing are actually ice crystals.
```

```other
* Day 2: Overcast. See clouds at the middle level of the sky. Mixture of stratus clouds and cumulus clouds.
```

```other
* Gradually, sky is filled with layer of white that completely blacks out the sun.
```

```other
* Then gets darker and darker with clouds getting lower.
```

```other
* When clouds gets thick and dark enough, rain comes, which lasts for days because they come from stratus clouds depending on the size of the system.
```

* NimboStratus cloud

```other
* Cumulus and stratus appear at different layers of the sky.
		* These observable characteristics tell you what is happening with the weather.
```

It is also important to be familiar with the different wind patterns in your area.

- Which way is the wind blowing at different levels of the sky?
- What direction are the clouds moving?
- The wind you are feeling the ground is not always the same as the wind in the cloud level.
- Take notes about the cloud types and overall wind directions.
