# Transform Your Habits

You don’t need the result or the once-in-a-lifetime transformation.

You need better habits.

Lasting change is a product of daily habits.

---

**3 R’s OF HABIT CHANGE**

1. Reminder (the trigger that initiates the behavior)
2. Routine (the behavior itself; the action you take)
3. Reward (the benefit you gain from doing the behavior)

---

**HOW TO USE THE 3R's**

**Step 1: Use a current habit as the reminder for your new one.**

How to discover a good reminder?

1. Write two lists.
2. List 1: things that you do each day without fail.
3. List 2: things that happen to you each day.

**Step 2: Make your habits incredibly easy to start.**

Identity first, consistency first (become the type of person who always sticks to your new habit).

Performance second.

Pick a new habit you want to start.

Now ask yourself, “How can I make this new behavior so easy to do that I can’t say no?"

**Step 3: Always reward yourself.**

Reward yourself with positive self-talk.

- “That was a good day.”
- “Good job. You made progress today."
- “Victory!"
- “Success!"
- “Good work!"

Enjoy each small success.

Make sure that the habits you are trying to build are actually important to you.

**IDENTITY HABITS**

Behaviors are a reflection of your current identity.

To change your behaviors, change your identity.

Focus on creating a new identity first.

In order to believe in a new identity, prove it to yourself.

---

**THE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE**

1. Your Identity - The person that you believe that you are.
2. Your Performance - The actions you take.
3. Your Appearance - The way the world perceives you.

---

**IDENTITY VS. PERFORMANCE & APPEARANCE GOALS**

Starting a behavior = identity-based goal

Amping and existing behavior = performance and appearance goals

---

**HOW TO USE IDENTITY HABITS**

1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Start small and trust that the results will come as you develop a new identity.

---

**IDENTITY-BASED HABITS + 3R’s OF HABIT CHANGE**

Identity-based habits offer a framework through which to view your goals.

- Start small
- Build your identity
- Do not worry about results

3R’s of habit change provide a plan for achieving your new identity.

- Link your new habit to a current behavior
- Reward yourself for a job well done.

---

**HOW TO START YOUR NEW HABIT**

Stop thinking about your life goals as big, audacious, life-changing transformations that happened only when the time is right or when you have better resources.

Think of your life goals as tiny, daily behaviors that are repeated until success becomes inevitable.

Daily habits - tiny routines that are repeatable - are what make big dreams a reality.

---

**HOW TO FIT NEW HABITS INTO YOUR LIFE**

Do not set a deadline.

Set a schedule to work towards your goal consistently.

It’s not about doing your best work, it’s about doing the best you can on a consistent basis.

It doesn’t matter what you’re doing, if you only work when you feel motivated, then you’ll never be consistent enough to make significant impact on your life.

The focus is on doing the action, not on achieving X goal by a certain date.

---

**KEYSTONE HABITS**

A keystone habit is a behavior or routine that naturally pulls the rest of your life in order.

Focus on a single thing and improve your life in multiple areas at the same time.

What is the one thing that - when you do it - your day seems to go more smoothly?

Focus on your keystone habit and do more of it.

**HOW TO GET BACK ON TRACK AFTER SLIPPING UP**

It’s okay to slip up.

But get back on track quickly.

The best strategy isn’t to avoid failure, it’s to plan for it.

Anticipate the backward steps and develop a plan for getting back on track quickly.

**1. Put your habits on your calendar.**

Getting specific makes it real and give you a reason and a reminder to get back on track whenever you slip up.

When and where, exactly are you going to do this?

Do you have a system in place to automatically remind you to do your new habit?

**2. Stick to your schedule, even in small ways.**

If shit happens, reduce the scope, but stick to the schedule.

Prove to yourself that you can get something done even when the situation isn’t ideal.

It’s the cumulative impact of always sticking to your schedule that will carry you to long-term success.

**3. Have someone who expects something of you.**

**4. Design your environment for success.**

The things in your room are all pieces of your environment that can trigger you to take different actions regardless of how motivated you feel.

---

**BAD HABITS**

Bad habits are simply a way of dealing with stress and boredom.

Substitute your bad habits with new and healthy ways to deal with stress and boredom.

If bad habits are caused by deeper issues, ask:

- Are there certain beliefs or reasons that are behind the bad habit?
- Is there something deeper - a fear, an event, or a limiting belief - that is causing you to hold on to something that is bad for you?

Replace a bad habit with a new habit that provides a similar benefit.

---

**HOW TO CHANGE BAD HABITS**

**1. Choose a substitute for your bad habits.**

**2. Cut out as many triggers as possible.**

Avoid the things that cause your bad habits.

Change your environment.

**3. Join forces with somebody.**

**4. Visualise yourself succeeding.**

**5. You don’t need to be someone else, you just need to return to the old you.**

You already have it in you to be someone without your bad habits.

You just need to return to being healthy.

Use the word “but” to overcome negative self-talk.

**6. Plan for failure.**

Get back on track very quickly.

---

**FIRST STEP TO BREAKING A BAD HABIT**

The only goal is to be aware of when it happens and how often it happens.

Awareness will show you how to actually make change.

- When does your habit actually happen?
- How many times do you do it each day?
- Where are yo?
- Who are you with?
- What triggers the behavior and causes it to start?

Simply tracking these issues will make you more aware of the behavior and give you dozens of ideas for stopping it.

**BRIGHT LINES RULE**

A bright-line rule refers to a clearly defined rule or or standard. It is a rule with clear interpretation and very little wiggle room. It establishes a bright line for what the rule is saying and what it is not saying.

Fuzzy statements make progress hard to measure.

The things that we measure are the things we improve

Establish a bright line for your new habit goal.

---

**BENEFITS OF BRIGHT LINES**

1. Bright lines help you avoid making just-this-once exceptions.
2. Bright lines help you avoid decision fatigue because decisions are made ahead of time.

---

**PROGRESSIVE EXTRIMISM**

Do not change everything at once.

Take a very clear and extreme stand in one small area.

Over time, you can progressively move your bright line forward and add other behaviors to the mix.
