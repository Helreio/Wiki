# Establish a workflow that is motivating

When we do our work because it is inwardly rewarding ([[thoughts/process over product]]), we develop a growth mindset. But mindset is not enough. We need a workflow that is inwardly rewarding by itself.

It is important to establish a motivating workflow because the experience encourages us to repeat the circle. When we repeat something, we get timely and concreate feedback, which is what makes us get better. When we are good at something, we enjoy doing it. That is why a motivating workflow is the foundation for a better and happier work.

But, how can one establish a motivating workflow?

Remember that [[Freedom motivates us]], so [[A good workflow optimizes freedom]]. A workflow that optimizes freedom is a flexible workflow, and [[A flexible working scheme prevents losing interest]].

One characteristic of a flexible workflow is that it is broken into smaller tasks ([[Working on smaller tasks creates a sense of control]]; [[Break down your work into small and clearly separated tasks]]). If you break your workflow into small tasks, it is easier to stop, pivot, and return to the work. It is also easier to get many feedback loops ([[A circular workflow allows for many feedback loops]]).
