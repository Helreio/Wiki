# Right now, I want a life of freedom

A life flexible to constant change

Open to stuff

Open to different identities

This is who I really am

Based on what I feel personally through my intuition

And based on personality tests

I don't like being caged

I like to fly and change when I want to

Being who I really am is the best way I can be truly happy
