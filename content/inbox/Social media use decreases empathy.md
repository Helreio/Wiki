# Social media use decreases empathy

I have to resign to the fact that my experience with it is what matters. I’m a highly sensitive person. Energy really affects me. I have a proclivity toward extremes. I’m highly distractible. I’m a creator and my work requires periods of deep focus. These things do not bode well when it comes to social media.
