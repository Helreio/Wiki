Change permanently to make better, healthier choices.

To change permanently:

1. Understand who you are
2. Understand what the people around you are doing

Permanent change starts with:

1. Observation - Be aware of how you are and how you want to be.
2. Preparation - Prepare for change.
3. Cultivation - Cultivate change so you don’t all back into old habits.

Observation reveals, stops, and changes automatic behaviors we acquired in past relationships and situations.

**Observation**

Take time to observe what is going on around you.

You need to recognize what isn’t working so that you can develop better strategies.

Be truly in touch with your thoughts, feelings, and actions to understand what needs to change and why.

**Observation is necessary to changing your life.**

Self-discipline -> Observation -> Health

You need to be able to observe even when it’s not fun.

A healthy and happy person have learned to read people before they ever have to encounter an issue with them.

Learning to read people starts with observation.

Before you can begin to hone your observation skills, understand the amount of time you spend with your technology and limit it.

**Checklist for a happier and healthier person**

Have uninterrupted, alone time where you can be with your own thoughts.

Never feel the need to explain where you are every second of every day.

Treat attempts to contact you as requests, not demands.

Never use you phone during social events.

Shut off all electronic devices at appropriate times during the day.

Train the people in your life that you are not available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Dedicate uninterrupted time and exclusive attention with the important people in your life.

Decide how much or how little you are going to respond to messages and interruptions.

Do not let anything take control of you life.

Being a keen observer of events in your life is essential in taking control of your life.

**HONING OBSERVATION**

Don’t try to avoid boredom. Let it inspire your creativity.

Have real life connection with others free from technology.

Take as much time as you can, every day, to hone your observation skills.
