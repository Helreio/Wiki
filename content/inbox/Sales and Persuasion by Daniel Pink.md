Change people minds to do something.

What is practical is also transcendent.

It’s a huge part of your work.

All kinds of personality can do this.

Take the other person’s perspective.

Use an empty chair to represent the reader.

Empathy, feeling what people feel.

When we are in a persuasion situation, focus on the thoughts.

If you are overloaded, use your head as much or more than your heart.

1. Use their emotional state as a signal.
2. Hypothesize about a person’s state of mind.
3. Then test your hypothesis by asking quesitions

The fourth argument is too much.

Cognitive load is difficult.

# Getting others to act

People should do something themselves.

## Don't iritate, agitate

Agitation is getting people to do what they ought to do

Help other people summon their own motivation

Lead with your ears not your mouth

## Motivation interviewing

Ask two irrational questions:

- On a scale of 1 to 10, how ready are you to do this?
- Why didn’t you pick a lower number?

Help people articulate their own reasons for doing something.

What can we do to make it a 1?

## Bring social proof

## Build an off-ramp

Make it easy for people to act.
