# In personal finance, balance now and the future

I don't think I'll be able to do five years of more minimalism than I am already currently doing.

I want to balance the NOW with the FUTURE. I could die any day, so why should I postpone starting something I want to do for five years?

A strategy to apply this principle can be:

1. Get a good day job.
2. Build a business that you could scale to profitability.
3. Use that to build a nest egg fast.
4. Invest.
5. Retire.

All of these don't have to take a lot of time. If I can build the business and take it to profitability in five years time then accumulate my nest egg for another five years, I would've been successful.
