# Energy and Time The Two Capital for Action

# Energy and Time: The Two Capital for Action

An active action requires energy. This is the capital to action that is internal to any individual.

Because of the fact that life is finite, time, an external phenomenon, is treated also as a capital.

An action can only be performed if there is time for it and of there is sufficient energy to perform it.

You can only play with your kid (action) if you dedicate a specific schedule for it (time) and if you are able to do it (energy).

Actions compete for time and energy.
