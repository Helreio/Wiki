# Anger Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Advantages Of My Anger**

**Disadvantages Of My Anger**

2. But every time after you get angry, you feel bad about yourself because you did something against your goal of being a more peaceful human being.
3. Anger is a way for me to transmit a message to other people that I am not someone they can just mistreat.
3. This will alienate you from other people and will create poles between you and others. The truth is usually, people do not intend to mistreat you.

You can be a strong person without being an angry loony.
