# Talahardin can process information regardless of genre or medium

Statements that contain claims about the nature of the world that are present in stories, both fiction or non-fiction, should be treated the same way as claims from theoretical texts when using the [[Talahardin]].

Even statements with meanings that are less straightforward is still information, and the Talahardin could turn that information into knowledge the same way it does for more straightforward statements.
