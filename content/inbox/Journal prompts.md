# Journal prompts

I am trying to imitate colorful language. But is that really me?

I want to be that person to others

- an example of careful, honest, and humble intellectual life
- An example of prolific, vulnerable, moving, and nonantagonistic expression of one's beliefs thru writibg
- An example of someone who builds relationships

Highly divisive topics, should we talk about them?

Should we change people's minds?

Should you really speak your truth? Or should you just live it?

Journal about your life after the JWs using the the questions below

- Am I truly happy outside the organization?
- How successful have I been in building a life outside of it?
- How do I embrace the life I want to live instead of continuously psychologically escaping that life that I rejected?
- How do I use this story as foder for my writing?
- How do I transform that tumultuous situation into someting beautiful?
- Do I need support from a communite of ex JWs?

I feel uncomfortable not being in front of a screen in the evening. What is this discomfort?
