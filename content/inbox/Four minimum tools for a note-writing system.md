# Four minimum tools for a note-writing system

[[Use a note-writing system]] that is simple. All you need is:

1. An undistracted brain
2. A reliable collection of notes

For your collection of notes ([[Talahardin]]), you should have a bare minimum of four tools:

1. [[Inboxes to capture fleeting notes]].
2. A [[Reference management system]].
3. The slip-box
4. An editor
   - Since I do most of my writing through [[craft]], I use it as my editor.

When using tools, remember that [[Tools should be embedded in a system to be effective]].
