# We can only argue using the tools we have

Some people argue that the processes of our brain and mind is only a shell that hinders us and may even misrepresent reality.

But even if it is true, what is a better alternative? To propose to think beyond the capabilities of our mind and brain? That is impossible. To do that, one has to rely on the very thing that one questions: one's brain and mind.

Our current brain and mind are the only tools that we have. We are more certain of things we know because of these tools than things we claim to know beyond these tools.

[[It is better to argue from what we are more certain of]].
