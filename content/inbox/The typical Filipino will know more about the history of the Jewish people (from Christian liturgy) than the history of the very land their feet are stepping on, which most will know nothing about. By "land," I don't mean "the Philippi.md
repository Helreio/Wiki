The typical Filipino will know more about the history of the Jewish people (from Christian liturgy) than the history of the very land their feet are stepping on, which most will know nothing about. By "land," I don't mean "the Philippines" in general, because most of us will learn a good amount of Philippine history as it is taught in primary and secondary schools (95% of which is still actually just the history of the Tagalogs). What I mean by "the very land their feet are stepping on" is your baley_ili_bayan, etc., even better your barangay, even better your sitio, even better the land where your house is built upon. Because that land was never like that at the time of your great grandfather, or your great great grand mother, and all the ancestors that came before them. Life as you know it today is very, very, very far from life as your ancestors lived it. How you see things will change dramatically if only you will know the story of those who came before us.
