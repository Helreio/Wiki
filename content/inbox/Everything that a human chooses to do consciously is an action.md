# Everything that a human chooses to do consciously is an action

Even inaction is an action.

This means, therefore, than man is in constant action, as long as he is conscious.

Even sleeping, if he "chose" to do so was an action.

He is only truly inactive if he is unconscious.

The definition of human action, therefore rests on two metaphysical premises.

1. Consciousness exists.
2. Free will exists.
