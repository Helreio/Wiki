If you drop the word spiritual, what you will realize is that most people had moments when they felt a deep connection with life. This is the phenomena that we brand as spiritual and it does not presuppose a belief on spirits or angels or crystals or energy fields. Anyone, everyone, even those who don't believe in anything New Agey had these moments.

The problem with the "spiritual" community is that by creating a groupthink phenom on their metaphysics, they allienate others who don't subscribe to their metaphysics and yet feel very deep connection with "life".

These days, I no longer read new age books and the like. I have a rational worldview. And yet, it doesn't mean I'm anything less of my spiritual self. Contrary. I'm even more deeply spiritual since I have shed the many assumptions New Age makes. I can see clearer what is really there. Grow in apprec
