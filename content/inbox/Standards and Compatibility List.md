# Standards and Compatibility List

ME

I chose partners who were beautiful but were less intelligent than me. I think this lead to a feeling of domination over them, which fed my perfectionistic tendencies.

I chose partners who were cheated on.

- I must choose partners who are emotionally healthy and ready for a long-term relationship.

I became absent in the relationship.

- I must be present in the relationship every day.

I had anger issues in the relationship.

- I must be kind, tolerant, and patient towards my partner.

I was perfectionistic.

- I must maintain my standards when choosing someone so that I don’t get too perfectionistic later on. However, I won’t have it all, so I should learn to let go of the little things. I should have a realistic expectation of my partner.

I pried into her email and social media accounts.

- I must not pry into her private affairs without her consent.
- But I should also ask for transparency if it is necessary.
