# Separate business from your art

You may offer some products

But dont make your art your "sole source" of income

You have to diversify income sources. Maybe one is main. And a few other alternatives.

Combine this with simple living.

Then you

- Dont have to be popular (only to a small audience).
- Dont have to be despearately salesy.
- Dont have to be hindered by fame in your creative freedom.
