The difference between feeling awe when looking at a flower vs a painting of it lies to the fact that we usually know who painted a painting and even if we do not know the identity of the painter we at least know that he's human. The same can't be said about the creator of the flower. We cannot say for sure who the artist is or what kind of being she is. That adds to the feeling of awe.

Not being able to explain it but feeling really surprised.
