Hi I’m Vince. I’m currently building my life philosphy and manual, writing in Pangasinan, translating Thoreau in Filipino, and collecting binaural videos.

I publish a weekly newsletter about my journey in living a good life.

Every day, I reflect on the question, "How should I live?"

This question has brought me to philosophy, art, and the outdoors. I am searching for answers that are both beautiful and true—that is, answers that inspire peace, happiness, and flourishing but are also based on careful and honest thought. I write about this personal odyssey.

Here's the story behind this quest.
