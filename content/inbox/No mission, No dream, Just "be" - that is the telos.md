# No mission, No dream, Just "be" - that is the telos

My goal is to free myself of the intention to make money.

To do things without any other intention than to enjoy and be proficient doing them.

I will avoid rockstar careers.

I will avoid careers altogether.

This is not an ethical stand.

Itâ€™s a purely subjective practical rational stand.
