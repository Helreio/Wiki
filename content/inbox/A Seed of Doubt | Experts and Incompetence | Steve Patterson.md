“But this story felt familiar – almost identical to my experience in the Christian evangelical world. My peers all agreed with each other; they agreed with the pastors; they shared the same assumptions, and they never actually investigated the ideas for themselves. They thought, as I once did, “Surely, everybody can’t be wrong.””

“How could it be that so many professors are wrong about basic economics and basic political ideas? Are they all stupid? I doubt it. It’s something like a systemic flaw in the entire academic system – something similar to what I experienced as a teenager.”

“Think about it: why do so many theologians believe in God? Well, they share foundational premises. How many “expert theologians” convert to atheism? How many articles are written in “expert theological journals” arguing that God doesn’t exist?”

“The entire field shares flawed premises.”

“And then, only the best students would graduate and become professors themselves. The next generation would have the same ignorant assumptions as the first, and they would shepherd their students in the same way. It’s the blind leading the blind. Nobody has the incentive or care to challenge any of their fundamental, inaccurate assumptions.”

“Imagine the ridicule a Buddhist or Muslim would experience attending a Mormon college. All the professors, all the students, all the books, all the credentials, all the assumptions – they presuppose the expertise, wisdom, and competence of their Mormon staff. The Buddhist would be laughed out of the room, and his professors wouldn’t have the time or the incentive to bother thinking otherwise.”

“an idea gets accepted as fact by the experts, and it’s taught for years as standard theory, allthewhile being fatally flawed.”

“Indeed, the more you learn about the world, the more you realize this happens all the time, in virtually every field of thought.”

“Well, for reasons I will not go into here, that foundational assumption is incorrect. Turns out, the fat hypothesis has some elementary errors. If anything, their recommendations – to eat healthy grains and avoid saturated fat – have likely caused heart disease, much less reduce it.”

“The answer is obvious: the foundational assumptions weren’t challenged. The flaw in academia showed itself. People assumed that the information you learn in textbooks must be true – that only cranks challenge the well-established theories of experts. Thousands of students, thousands of doctors, repeating the same, false, harmful information.”

“If my suspicions are correct, “the experts” should be trusted as much now as a decade ago. Meaning of course, they shouldn’t be trusted at all, because chances are they’ve never investigated the foundations of what they believe.”

“It’s not just nutrition. It’s not just economics and political theory. This phenomena is true in literally every field of thought I’ve studied. The “mainstream consensus” is fatally flawed, and some small, heterodox school gets things right. It’s true in philosophy. It’s true in mathematics. It’s true in physics. It’s true in the martial arts. I can’t say, “this is universally true”, because I’ve not studied every field of thought, but I have a hunch.”

“When you understand economics, you understand the hubris of central planning. The economy is not something to be centrally designed; it emerges from the interactions of the many individuals in society. It cannot be any other way – too much information is too dispersed over too many people for any one group to understand what the heck is going on.”

“The same is true for social issues. You have to be deluded to think you’re competent enough to legislate morality”

“It’s the same arrogance – the same self-delusion.

Honestly, this is what I think happens in the world of academia. People are so wrong, from the students to the professors to the administrators, because they desperately want to see themselves as intelligent. And, terrifyingly, they actually believe they are. They agree with the credentialing system – if a piece of paper says I graduated, I must be smart, which means my ideas must be accurate!”

“And the system perpetuates itself. The best students – the best regurgitators – will go on to be professors, who will teach the next batch of students, and the cycle continues. The underlying assumptions – in philosophy, in economics, in political theory, in theology, in biology, in physics, in mathematics, in sociology – never get challenged, and the self-delusion keeps turning over.”

“I suggest keeping an open mind, and letting a little seed of doubt root in your mind. If students and professors are incompetent and never challenge their foundational assumptions, what would the world look like?”
