# Peer review skepticism is reasonable

Skepticism about peer-reviewed journal articles and studies is a valid and reasonable skepticism to have. Any honest person could see that medical and scientific boards as well as academia suffers from the same political brouhaha that infests government institutions. Peer review leads to groupthink, which silences contrarian voices and ideas, which in turn prevents innovation (for an excellent introduction to the flaws of the peer review process, see [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420798/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420798/)). But more than that, this heirarchical approach to discovering and establishing truth has led to persecution of doctors and medical professionals who had contrarian opinions (i.e., removal of licenses, etc.).

Peer-reviewed journals publish more articles that support rather than debunk dominant scientific and ideas. Therefore, if you want to get a “balanced” understanding of a topic of any scientific interest, relying solely on peer-reviewed journals is a poor methodology. A better approach is to look into the peer-reviewed journals AND gather materials that will never make it into these journals because of their radical or contrarian nature—materials that I learned to value a lot when I studied history in college: eye-witness accounts, case studies, data from individual practicing doctors.

Case in point, we have so much studies on the effectivity of the vaccine but so little about the adverse effects of the vaccine. Eighteen months or so, and we still don’t have a study? This is despite the fact that frontliners are required to report these effects, and frontliners DO see them first-hand. Why are they not reporting them? More accurately, why are they so afraid of reporting them?

This video is an example of the material I am referring to above, which counter-balances the group-think material from peer-reviewed journals. This expose is a perfect example of the knowledge we miss when we solely rely on studies.

It is too sad and too painful to have to watch this and realize that so many of my loved ones could have had an adverse reaction to the vaccine, and they will never know about it, because we don’t have information available about these adverse effects, and whatever is available gets censored.

Another thing that pains me from this video is this. What is happening all around us right now, is making it so hard for people who think differently to even live normal lives. I am not a very religious person, but there are people who have religious beliefs that won’t allow them to take the COVID vaccine. I have friends who don’t eat certain foods because of their religious or spiritual beliefs—vegetarian friends, vegan friends, muslim friends, Christian friends who don’t eat blood. And how we respond to them is we respect their beliefs. Because that is the “loving” thing to do.

With the vaccine, all of a sudden, that respect is gone. We don’t have a conversation about the pros and cons of the vaccine. We shame people who are skeptical about it. Our policies are slowly turning into a medical authoritarian regime where the unvaccinated are persecuted. Worse, we “force” people to take the vaccine without informed consent.

What happened to “respecting people for their beliefs”?
