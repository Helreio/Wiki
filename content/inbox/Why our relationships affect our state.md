# Why our relationships affect our state

By itself, Ginhawa is a psychological value that can be generated by simply using one’s mind and body. No other resources are needed. If one really thinks about it, one can have a really strong mental fortitude that one could feel this state easily. Of course, one needs to sustain body to continue feeling good. But there is an upper limit of what we can do with our physical environment to help us feel better. Our psychological skills are more important than our ability to curate our environment.

By overrelying on curating environment and nature, we make it more difficult for others to do the same. Other people are important because they affect our state too.

Compassion is necessary in building a world where we could thrive. Our quest for happiness and feeling good, which is deeply personal, extends towards our quest to help others feel good and happy. Others also include people who are not yet alive: our children.

This is what bearing one’s own children does to us. We know that a part of us will inherit the world we are creating. They are family and we don’t want family to get hurt.
