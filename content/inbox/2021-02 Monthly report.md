# 2021-02 Monthly report

# Summary

This month, I celebrated my 29th birthday at Danielito’s with Claire, Rem, and Lea. It was my first time to be sang with happy birthday by a band. The food was greata there, but I continued to experience more food in Los Baños: the Orient buko pie (c/o Cris which I finally met), pesa by Claire, Ate Onyang’s chicken wings, and Satya Graha. That is all while I also experimented with cooking reflux-friendly recipes for my own. I also cooked and ate pad thai with Lea and her family to celebrate Valentine’s day. Aside from the food, it was also a month of friendships. I befriended Ate Mona, my new neighbor, which I later helped to find a job. I also bonded with Diwa for the first time by foraging and eating at Chelsea’s with her. While these was all happening, I was busy looking for an apartment to stay in for the long term. I found the perfect place at Mavina apartment. I had some initial issues with dealing with my land lady and the tenant that was leaving, but finally, I was able to move in at my new place. This month, I shared my spiritual history to Claire, which inspired me to write vignettes about my depression story. I also continued to translate Thoreau, released my annual review, and wrote a poem about transfering to LB. I also started thinking about my work—connecting and defining my field. Rem’s workshop on love triggered a long exchange and deep thinking about the concept, which also allowed me to share about my amoralism. Lastly, I worked on improving the security of my online data and laptop this month.

## Setback and Challenges

- I had a rocky start with Ms. Lou Ann, my new landlady. But through the help of Fruit Salad and my own self-control, I was able to renegotiate my relationship with her.
- I learned from my experience (mistake) with negotiating the internet at my new house. I could have handled it better if I wasn't that distrustful of people. Perhaps I did the right thing by following my tendencies, but I also know within me that I can abuse this tendency to distrust if I don't catch myself.

## Insights and Lessons

- Experiencing and understanding Ginhawa as a way of living is the core of my work. Inner work is the main work. If it doesn't feel right, it isn't right. What I want is to study, apply what I studied, talk about what I have learned from my study and practice. I'm doing this not as a researcher but as an ordinary human being who is just interested.
- Thoreau’s reminder on my birthday: to break my silence, to speak up, to be who I am.
