# Email for old subscribers

Hi ___________

It's been a while since I last sent an email to you via the email address that you so generously provided me.

You may not even remember that you subscribed to my newsletter. You may not even remember my name, especially if you don't know me "in real life".

To be honest, I feel really bad that I haven't taken full advantage of this privilege that you have given me. It is as if you have given me a seat on your dining table, inviting me for a cup of coffee or a slice of bread, only for me to repeatedly decline.

I haven't really lived up to this privilege of communing with you even just through words on a screen in a regular basis.

And even on those times when I did show up, I haven't fulfilled my promises. I failed to finish email series that I told you I will be sending (like that email series of vignettes about my depression, which I decided to end because it felt a little wrong to write my experience in chunks).

I haven't followed through a weekly schedule of writing to you.

It's discouraging.

And, honestly, I have begun entertaining the fact that I'm probably really bad at this. That I probably should stop.

And you know why I'm probably bad at it? It's because I feel like I'm constantly changing. Some writers, the really, really good ones, are able to grapple this tsunami of changes within them and channel that into a beautiful calm river that they let others swim through.

That's not me. Or perhaps, I haven't reached that point yet.

Do you know that feeling that you seem to be re-starting all the time? That's me for the past seven years or so writing on the internet.

It was exciting the first three years. To discover stuff, copy them, and restart. But moving forward, when this happens all the time. Starting. Then restarting once more. You begin to lose confidence about your ability to deliver. And I have honestly reached that point.

And this, my friend, is even a bigger reason why I should feel extremely grateful for your presence here in this email river of mine. You have stuck with me from the start, probably three years ago when I started sending these "inconsistent" emails.

It amazes me that you haven't even unsubscribed yet. Perhaps you have forgotten that you can actually do that. You can unsubscribe right now if that feels right to you. I totally understand if you want to leave.

Hmm. You're still here?

Is there something that I am probably doing right that even if my emails are too inconsistent, you've chosen to stay around? What is it? Can you please let me know by replying to this email?

I am re-starting (yes, that word again) this newsletter by giving it a name for the first time. I consider this my last attempt at consistently writing a newsletter. If this fails once more, I'm done for good and will be deleting this newsletter forever.

If you still want to read my words despite how bad I am at doing this, please reply to this email and tell me you still want to come along. If you're too busy to do that, you don’t have to do anything. I’ll take that as a yes. But if for any reason you want to leave (because you’ve forgotten to unsubscribe or you don’t know that you can actually do that, click unsubscribe).

Tomorrow, I’ll be sending the first issue of my last attempt at writing a newsletter.
