## Paragraph 2

If you're here, you probably already know something about my work. But what you may not know is that I'm an *independent* researcher. These projects are my full-time "job"… except insofar as they don't generate income. Instead, my work is funded through a *crowdfunded research grant,* from people like you.

What to put in my page to entice people

Fund current projects

- Ginhawa philosophy
- Maginhawang pamimilosopiya

Which make future projects possible

- Right now, I work 5-10 days a month as an academic editor, then do research 20-25 days a month. While my work as an editor does not take away creative and intellectual energy that I put in on my most important projects, they do disrupt the flow of insights. Through your support, I could further lessen my editorial work load, so that I could put more of my attention to what I do best: researc

Aside from these, you will be able to support my other projects:

- The first translation of Henry David Thoreau's journals to Filipino
- A literary hub of new works in Pangasinan language: one of the endangered languages in the Philippines
