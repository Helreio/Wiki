I need to make my life more interesting, more attuned to Ginhawa. I can do that by:

Increasing my time outdoors. This means closer to Nature, more physical activity.

I need my daily fieldworks.

I also get my writing done outdoors.

Return of morning bike rides: i can do this early so i can also do some writing outdoors. At least an hour.

Then, afternoon bike rides from 4-6:30. Naturalist project.
