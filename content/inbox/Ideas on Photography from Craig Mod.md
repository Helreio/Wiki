# Ideas on Photography from Craig Mod

# Insights

To what service do I create images?

Photography, for me, has always been about story. Has always been about placing markers in my mind to which to later return.

The who, what, when, where, why, and how of the thing before the lens. And how capturing that image would inform some future version of my self, or, god willing, something larger.
