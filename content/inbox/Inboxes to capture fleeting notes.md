# Inboxes to capture fleeting notes

I capture [[Fleeting notes]] into three inboxes:

1. I use [[Drafts]] to capture notes on the fly.
2. I use an analog [[Diary]] (currently, Sketchbook blank journals) and pen (currently, Pilot G-2 10) to write on my journal.
3. I also capture digital notes through [[craft]] when I am working on my laptop.

These inboxes are drained regularly in different schedules because [[Efficient inboxes are reliably drained]]. Fleeting notes in Drafts and my diary are reviewed to identify interesting writing prompts. These prompts are transferred to the Craft inbox, which serve as a [[writing inbox]] for transient notes that will eventually be processed into [[Evergreens]].
