# Walking is not the point

The point is whatever that state of mind you want to achieve.

Contemplation.

Meditation.

Zettelkasten.

These are all tools.

Walking is a tool.

I don't want to put unnecessary emphasis on a tool.

What has to be emphasized is the state of mind - repeated and it becomes a lifestyle.
