# The purpose of the website vinceimbat.com

# Main purpose

The main purpose of the website is to become a platform where I could share shareable creative artifacts of my work that could help others who share my values and beliefs and who want to live a similar lifestyle to mine.

What are those values?

What is that lifestyle?

- This website is dedicated to how to live a self-directed contemplative life

What are the things I want to bring into the world?

- Walk narratives
- Poetry
- Photographs
- Words that help us grapple with the mystery of being alive

But how do I become authentic in how I express myself?

Goals

- to sharpen my writer's voice
- To join a consortium of writers
- Start an invitation-only group

What will I champion?

- truth, freedom, nonviolence, and happiness

# Secondary purposes

The website will have the following purposes:

- **An iterative documentation of my life.** The website is this iterative and ever-updating resource for my particular lifestyle. Most pages are a combination of a narrative and a how-to manual of my individual projects and life areas. My site shall become an articulation of my personal life philosophy and its development and expression through various creative projects.
- **A hub of different projects.** The website is a hub from which all my projects are connected. All projects featured in the website are connected to my philosophy and lifestyle.
- **A place to publish well-developed ideas from the Talahardin.** The bulk of pages in the website shall be developed from notes in my Talahardin. For these pages to be created, I need to document and track my projects using a seamless review system. The website is like an orchard where fully developed essays are created from the workflow: Fleeting notes/Literature notes → Permanent notes → Structure notes → Articles. It is also a convergence tool that aggregates atomic scattered ideas into a structure that enriches my thinking.
- **A part of my most important life-long project.** The website will be part of the masterpiece I am building (Talahardin + Website). This pair is to me what Thoreau’s journal was to him.
