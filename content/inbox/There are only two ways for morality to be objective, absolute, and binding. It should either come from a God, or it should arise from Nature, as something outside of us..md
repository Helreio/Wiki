# There are only two ways for morality to be objective, absolute, and binding. It should either come from a God, or it should arise from Nature, as something outside of us.

Since both positions are easy to attack and hard to defend, morality (the rules of how one should live) are either coming:

- From ourselves,
- From others,
- Or from an abstraction, like reason
