# How to Take Digital Notes (at Teachable)

Think of your creative work as a factory.

- Input
- Process
- Output (to consumers)

A shortcut is to look for models.

- Look for people who are like you and find out what they are doing that you can steal.

You are cooking with knowledge. You’re a knowledge chef.

Don’t overdo your system. To sustain your system, it has to be dead simple. Because when life happens, the house of cards collapses.

I put all the OCD systems of my life in one place so that the rest of my life can be free and simple (everything is in the computer, the rest is free).

- Centralize your OCD. You know it is there but it doesn’t have to be everywhere in your life.
