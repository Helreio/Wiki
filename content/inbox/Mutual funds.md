# Mutual funds

Mutual funds are a pool of investor money collected from small-time investors that is then used to buy holdings (stocks, bonds, currencies, etc.)

They were created to make investing more affordable to small investors because there are certain investments that are too expensive for a single investor to afford.

Because of [[Problems with mutual funds]], consider buying [[ETFs]] instead.
