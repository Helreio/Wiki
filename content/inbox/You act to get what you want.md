# You act to get what you want

[[What we ultimately want is to be in a particular mental state]], and the only way you get to be in that particular mental state is through taking [[thoughts/action]]. Taking action involves:

- having a conscious intention to achieve a particular [[Mental state]] and
- making a decision on what move to take to attempt to bring you to your desired mental state.

[[Getting what you want involves a single action or a series of actions]]. If our want is simple, a single action can fulfill it. If our want is complex, multiple actions need to be performed in order to fulfill it (i.e, [[Project]]). A life [[thoughts/purpose]] is a complex want. Getting to it will involve multiple actions. In fact, [[thoughts/life is a project]].
