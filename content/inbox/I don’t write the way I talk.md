# I don’t write the way I talk

There is a disconnect between how I write and how I speak. I reveal more in writing than in speaking. But this is because, when talking, I listen more than I talk. During times when I talked a lot in a conversation, did I sounded that way when I wrote?

My voice is generally fuck it and intellectual (trying to simplify stuff), not poetic.

I am poetic when I watch the sunset and feel in awe. But I don’t use words. I just be.

I have a feeling that I might still be working in a field that is less optimal for me. I need to embrace who I “currently am” fully and see if I can maximize this rather than replace or improve it.
