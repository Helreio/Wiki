## I am grateful for:
1. The beautiful Jamboree road for existing.
2. Learning that photography is all about light and composition. This has already affected how I look at the world when doing photography walks.
3. Slowly easing to the fact and possibility that I may indeed lose money and being okay about it.

## Affirmation

"I can go into deep work."
