# Optimizing my life system = optimizing my life

When I study and apply stuff to optimize my life system, what I am doing is optimizing my life in general. This is the most important work—the work that people don’t see. And rightfully so. Because the audience of this work is myself. The standards to be met in this work are the standards I set for myself.
