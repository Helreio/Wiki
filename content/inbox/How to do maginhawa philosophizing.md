# How to do maginhawa philosophizing

[[Philosophy has to be maginhawa to motivate everyone to think for themselves]]. Here are top of the mind ideas on how to make philosophy more accessible through [[Maginhawang pamimilosopiya]]:

1. Integrate contemplative practices with it.
2. Use a curiosity-led workflow like [[Zettelkasten]] or [[Talahardin]].
3. Employ [[Self-directed learning]]. Only follow areas of philosophy that really matters to your own life.
4. Balance intensive intellectual blocks of time with going to nature ([[Walking accomplishes multiple goals]]).
5. Incorporate play.
6. Use a [[Cautious sharing process]].
