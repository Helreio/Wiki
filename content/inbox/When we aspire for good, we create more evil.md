# When we aspire for good, we create more evil

When we look at it closely, we realize that our sense of justice seems not very different from how we want our cofee made.

It is simply a reflection of our preferences, which are, in turn, a reflection of our unique psychological makeup.

It is based on our subjective ideas on what is "good" and "bad" and that is why we see different and often clashing ideas of justice.

Often, clashes happen because people think that their ideas of justice are "objective" and that everyone should espouse them. Those who don't share them are "bad" and should be removed from the face of the earth.

This is a perfect example of how the more we aspire for "goodness", the more "evil" we actually create.

P.S. I am referencing what Lea shared about what Sadguru said.
