# Meta-plan for resolving the iPhone 11 Pro issue

Brainstorm options

- Sell the phone to Lea (1k per month for 38 months).
- Have it fixed by an Apple Service Company.
- Sell it to people with less price just to get back some of the money.
- Find a way to trade it in.

Before trading in, try if you can sell it at a higher price

Next Actions

- Send a message to QCD and ask for specific advice.
