# Disagreement argument

The disagreement argument is a simple yet potent argument that proves that [[Moral relativism is wrong]].

Here is an example to demonstrate the disagreement argument.

Take two truth claims:

(A) The intentional slaughter of millions of innocent noncombatants is morally

justified as a means to promote my ends.

(B) The intentional slaughter of millions of innocent noncombatants cannot

be morally justified under any circumstances.

These two moral statements that are exact opposites of each other “disagree” due to obvious points about ordinary language. There is no need for theory here.

What relativization does is simply hide the disagreement that lies at the essence of moral statements. It is wrong to say that two exact opposite moral statements do not really disagree. The linguistic intentions of relativists are actually absolutist.

Moral statements need to be absolute if they are even to exist.

What seems relative then is really our subjective experiences, conscious awareness, and its contents. We do things primarily because of our subjective thoughts and experiences. We don’t do them because of some absolute objective standard that exists either within us or out there in the world.
