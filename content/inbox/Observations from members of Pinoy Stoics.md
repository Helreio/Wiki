# Observations from members of Pinoy Stoics

As part of defining [[thoughts/my audience and community]], [[My ideal audience persona]] and applying [[Dan Blank]]'s [[Hone your craft and engage your audience]] and [[Hone your gateway]], I started participating in the Pinoy Stoics Facebook group where I discovered the following about my target audience:

- Most of them found stoicism as a form of therapy to life.
- We really only realize our need for Ginhawa when we find ourselves in mentally tough situations.
- They chose to look to ancient philosophy for emotional cure.

But we shouldn’t really be surprised about this because almost all disciplines where these people would look for cure can be converted to philosophy because these disciplines have truth claims.

Here’s a list of the specific reasons they mentioned that led them to stoicism:

- They want to have a better perspective in life and be more open.
- It feels more versatile and authentic.
- They are going through mental issues: anxiety, schizophrenia, sensitivity, anger, and narcissistic abuse.
- They encountered it through social media (YT).
- They experienced existential crisis.
- They experienced social-inspired problems: ostracisim
- They went through a life change: motherhood.
- They wanted to think outside of religion.
- They are atheists and they needed a coping mechanism,
