# Makiling Street

Quietnes: 4.5/5

Almost feels like Pulog, only that there are more vacant lots here, which makes the quietness a little bit more. This also means that there are considerably more flora here including larger trees. I also noticed that there is a stream here almost like a little river which does not appear in the map perhaps because it has dried up or is to small to matter but I think this stream will fill up in the rainy season.

It's probably one of the better streets outside UP.
