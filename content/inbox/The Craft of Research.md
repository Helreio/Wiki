**Prologue: Planning Your Project - An Overview**

Goal: Find a research question worth investigating that will lead to a research problem worth solving.

4 steps towards this goal

1. Find a topic specific enough to let you master a reasonable amount of information on it in the time you have.
2. Question that topic until you find questions that catch your interest.
3. Determine the kinds of evidence your readers will expect you to offer in support of your answer (i.e., Secondary or primary sources? Quantitative data, quotations from authorities, or firsthand observations?).
4. Determine whether you can find this evidence.

4 steps to do after accumulating evidence

1. Assemble an argument that makes your case
2. Plan your argument
3. Draft your argument
4. Revise your argument

These steps can overlap

What is data?

- Anything you can find “out there” relevant to answering your research question.
- Data is inert but when used to support a claim, they become evidence.

Write

- For routine note-taking
- For reflection
- To catch random thoughts

# 3 - From Topics to Questions

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=2.922251,101.651064)

A subject is not a topic

- Subject: a broad area of knowledge
- Topic: a specific interest within that area

Topic

- An approach to a subject that asks a question whose answer solves a problem that readers care about
- An interest stated specifically enough for you to imagine becoming a local expert on it
- Start with your interest but eventually think about your readers

When does a question raise a problem?

- When not answering it keeps us from knowing something more important than its answer.
- If not answering it has no apparent consequence, it does not raise a problem.

How to find a topic?

1. List as many interests as you can that you’d like to explore.
2. Choose the one or two that interest you most and explore their research potential.
3. Look for a reference/encyclopedia entry on (i.e., Encyclopaedia Britannica, Encyclopedia of Religion, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) your topic and read it.
4. Copy the list of references at the end of the entry for a closer look.
5. Skim headings in specialized indexes (i.e., Philosopher’s Index, Psychological Abstracts).
6. Use subheadings for ideas of how others have narrowed your topic.
7. Use Google Scholar to skim articles and their list of sources.

Remember: narrow your topic

- At this point, see if a topic is viable.
- Most issues are usually too big for a research paper, so look for positions on narrow aspects of larger issues.
- Know the general outline of your topic.
- Know how others have narrowed theirs by browsing journals and websites.
- Try to narrow yours.
