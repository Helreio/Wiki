# Poetry is less accurate in its description of what we know

[[thoughts/poetry]] has the following uses:

1. By using metaphors, it can “attempt” to describe what cannot be truly captured by words (e.g. brain zap).
2. Poetry can entertain.
3. Poetry can convert serious or dry language into more attractive language.

But poetry cannot do what [[Prose]] or plain language can do, which is to be as accurate as possible in our description of what we know is there. It cannot judge the accuracy or truth of value statements. This is the job of prose. This is the job of philosophical language. It cannot be used to express in every day communication.

To do

- Think about the connection of this note with your notes on philosophy and sharing.
