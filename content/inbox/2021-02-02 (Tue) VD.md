- Total: 824

## Dinner (7:00 PM)

- Spinach omellete = 236
- Red rice (2.5 cups) - 216 x 2.5 = 540
- Ginataang cassava = 382
- Choco Butternut donut (1) = 400
- Total: 1558
- Hunger and Fullness: I was already full but I kept on eating. A big reason for this is I don’t have a refrigerator and I feel like Claire’s ulam will be wasted. Also, when I was waiting for her to finish cooking, I cooked a bigger omellete because I wasn’t sure if she’ll follow through. This need to have protein or something meaty during the meal is hurting me.
