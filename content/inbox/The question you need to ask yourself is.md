# The question you need to ask yourself is:

The question you need to ask yourself is:

Is life and the world beautiful enough for me to continue living in it for another day (and if that is overwhelming, another moment)?

And the trick is, the answer should always be YES. So you have to intentionally look for the beautiful things in life and the world and put yourself at their middle.

That is the only way you won't harm yourself.
