# Multipassionate Project Flow

A project could be

- Output-based
- Non-output-based

I would rather have an output.

Outputs lie on a spectrum from easy to produce to difficult to produce.

The size of the output should be proportional with the length of time you want to dedicate to the learning project.

To be safe, you can always start with the minimum viable output for the project - the smallest output that captures what you want to accomplish in the project.
