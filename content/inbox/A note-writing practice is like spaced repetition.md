# A note-writing practice is like spaced repetition

When you maintain a [[Talahardin]], you [[Combine curiosity with a note-writing system and practice]]. This combination of curiosity, habit, and a reliable system encourages you to revisit and revise your past notes. This is similar to [[Spaced repetition]].

The more you are interested in a topic, the more you revisit and revise your past notes about it. Revisiting helps you remember your thoughts, while revising improves how you see your ideas in general. Furthermore, according to the [[Generation effect]], you remember what you manage in your Talahardin because [[We remember what we created more than what we consumed]].
