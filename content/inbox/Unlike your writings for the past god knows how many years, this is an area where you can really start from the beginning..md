# Unlike your writings for the past god knows how many years, this is an area where you can really start from the beginning.

Of course you need to learn from the best

But you also need to be YOURSELF. Your story. That is what needs to be told.

The way you see the world. That is what needs to be communicated in fiction form.

The goal is not to master attention control. That is a worthy goal but not as worthy as the primary goal: the communication of what you sincerely believe to be true.
