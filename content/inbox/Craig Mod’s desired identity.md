# **Craig Mod’s desired identity**

I wanted my “identity” to be aligned with the actions of someone who publishes regularly, who writes about walking (in Japan or otherwise), has a personal photographic tone, and, ideally, produces unique, beautiful books.

Close peeking at details is everything.

- Uses camera as a tool to look closely.

The goal being to do this with every-increasing empathy — both looking out towards the world and inwards at my own body and mind and steps in that moment.

Turn off internet when you go to bed. Only open it after lunch the next day.

Do not agitate the mind in the morning. Let it stay quiet, thoughtful, and contemplative.

Does affecting one hundred lives turn you on? A thousand? A million? A billion? Why? What does it mean to have a positive impact on a life? How intimate does that connection need to be? Understanding your scale — the scale that moves you — is critical to understanding with whom and how you should work, how you should live.
