# Philosophy as belief is different from philosophy as discipline

There is definitely a need to differentiate on the usages of the word philosophy. I, for one, have committed this mistake by espousing Thoreau’s use of the word philosophy with the intention of democratizing philosophy ([[Thoreau uses the word “philosophy” leniently]]). This is another example of why [[The struggle for power should never medddle with the search for objective truth]].

However, using the word philosophy to refer to a belief is not the same as using it to refer to the discipline of philosophizing. According to [[Napoleon Mabaquiao Jr.]], there are two kinds of use of the word philosophy: [[Lenient use of “philosophy”]] and [[Strict use of “philosophy”]].
