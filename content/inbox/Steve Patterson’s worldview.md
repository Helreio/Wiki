# Steve Patterson’s worldview

In Steve Patterson’s worldview

- The world is essentially made up of “separate” particles.
- While the boundaries between macroscopic entities are uncertain, the boundary between particle and non-particle is clear.
- This separation between particles creates identity.
- Identity necessitates non-contradiction
- Non-contradiction necessitates “separation”
- The universality of the three laws of logic can be proven by “logic” itself.
- Without believing on logic, you won’t be able to argue rationally, you cannot use language effectively.
- The use of language needs logic. Logic needs the rules of language.
- Belief on logic is belief on common sense.
- Belief on logic means -> no belief on God, on infinities, on paradoxes

**Solution**

Accept this basic law of logic

But don’t treat it as proof that the world should run according to “separation”

I can be a dualist and yet still believe in interconnectedness

The linchpin is in the metaphysics of logic itself

I find his discussion on metaphysics and non-necessary certainty unsatisfactory.

The Universe is made up of base units.

These base units are only the actual things that physically exist.

Plurality = mind

Only simple substances

Because we have many minds, we have many substances (?)
