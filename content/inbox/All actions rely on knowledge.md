# All actions rely on knowledge

When you set an [[thoughts/intention]], you use knowledge about what you want, which could be influenced by past knowledge about many other things.

When you choose a [[Means]] to achieve an intention, you use knowledge about the options you have, which comes from research of past experiences.

When you [[Review]] whether or not an [[End state]] approximates an intention, you use knowledge from the experience you just had of using the means to satisfy an intention.
