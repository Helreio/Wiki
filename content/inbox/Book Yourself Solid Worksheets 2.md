# Ideal Client

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056846,120.453696)

**Who is the person you imagine speaking to in your writing?**

A multi-passionate male who ultimately wants to live a vibrant creative life but is challenged by chronic illness. He also have to contend with other challenges like overwhelm, making a living

**What does he or she do for a living - and why?**

He is currently on a traditional job. He is an employee. But he secretly desires to have more freedom in his life because he is a creative. He wants to have more time to pursue his many passions. Because of this, he is thinking about switching into freelancing, entrepreneurship, or other less taxing job options.

**What values do you and s_he share that makes him_her absolutely adore what you have to say - every tim you say it?**

Gentleness and balance.

**What goals does s_he have in his_her life?**

His greatest goal is finally to live a vibrant creative life that is attuned with his body, mind, and spirit.

Before he gets to this end goal, he has to reach the following milestones:

First, he wants to manage his health so it will never be a problem along the way plus he wants his health to support his most important goal.

Second, he wants to create more time doing the things he loves. This involves getting into a job that allows him to have more time to do his craft.

Third, he wants to be good at his craft to the point that people will start to pay attention.

In order for him to achieve these three prerequisites, he has to develop two important qualities along the way:

First, he has to develop mindfulness, contentment, and full presence in performing his craft.

Second, he has to embrace minimalism in managing his finances and in doing his/her every day activities.

---

My ideal person is a Filipino who wants to do work he loves through entrepreneurship, he wants to write and get published, but he is challenged by a chronic illness - like depression - and because of this, he has to devise ways to cope so that he can pursue his goal. He has to embrace a healthy lifestyle and embrace healthy life philosophies (like minimalism and mindfulness) in order for him to succeed.

# Written Exercise 4A - 5 Part Book Yourself Solid Dialogue Formula

I help spiritually-minded, service-oriented and highly creative individuals live more consciously, find their greatest contribution, tap into their most creative and divine selves, and ultimately pursue a career that heals the world.

**Their three biggest urgent needs are:**

1. SOUL WORK: Getting clarity on their message and defining their next steps.
2. PRACTICAL WORK: Supporting themselves financially and managing their finances while pursuing their vocation.
3. TECHNICAL WORK: Working on the nuts and bolts of their creative projects.

**My clients' compelling desires are:**

1. FREEDOM: To build a career or business that hopefully will bring them a measure of freedom.
2. HOLISTIC WORK: To build a career or business that suits their health needs.
3. CREATIVITY: To build a career or business that they will be able to enhance their creativity every step of the way.
4. AUTHENTICITY: To be known with a brand that is authentic.

**So I help them with those things by:**

1. TEACHING - Online courses and in-person workshops.
2. COACHING - One on one focus work on their specific situations.
3. WRITING - Informative and educational blog posts; and freelance writing services.

I’d say the number one result they experience when they work with me is MOVEMENT. Movement that is healthy, gentle, friendly, and sustainable. One they can continue to follow by themselves because they’ll feel that their goals are achievable.

**What’s more, they experience some deeper core benefits like...**

**Financial Benefits**

Content drive traffic to my clients’ blogs which means if they have a monetisation plan in place that’s money for them.

An ebook I create and launch for them will obviously make them money.

A beautiful website designed for the right audience will create more businesses for them.

Coaching them from the beginning until the end of launching their platform will result in a project that will earn them in the future recurrently.

**Emotional Benefits**

I emphasise simplicity in working with people so that removes a lot of stress.

I make them feel that their content is taken cared of by a seasoned and competent writer.

They are well-treated.

I make them feel like rockstars!

**Physical Benefits**

Holistically healthier overall.

**THE MEDIUM VERSION**

I help light workers live more consciously, find their greatest contribution, tap into their most creative and divine selves, and ultimately pursue a career that heals the world.

What’s a light worker?

A light worker is someone who is spiritually-minded, service-oriented and highly creative. She is naturally geared towards helping others. Her life’s work contributes to healing our ailing world. She serves but she does so in a way that is authentic to her true self and is nourishing to her soul.

For a light worker to live his vocation, he needs three things:

- A way to sustain himself financially so he can continue his work.
- A way to continuously nurture himself and replenish his soul so he can continue helping others.
- A message, a service, any form of contribution and a way to bring that contribution to whom it is meant for.

My life’s work is to help fulfil these needs for the light worker.

Through inspiring and informative blog posts, actionable books, educational courses, and intimately focused one-on-one coaching, I help light workers move with their missions.

I want you to feel freedom - freedom to do the work you were meant to do without struggling with money.

I want you to feel inner peace while you do your work. I want my processes to help you remove the overwhelm while pursuing your work so you can enjoy the journey.

I want you to feel connected to your purpose, connected to your true self, in alignment with what you believe in.

I want you to feel vibrant and creative, every day.

I want you to feel good serving other, serving the world.

***I want to help light workers align their lives with nature and the universe through the work they do, the service they provide, and within their inner lives.***

**Why I do what I do for the people I serve**

Freedom drives me.

The freedom to do what I want to do when I want to do it.

The freedom to be who I really am.

I guess working for myself would eventually lead to more time for a life that goes with the flow.

Creativity drives.

I hunger it.

It’s cathartic.

It heals me.

It brings joy, colour, adventure in my everyday life.

I want to be connected.

Connected with the people who think the same way, who feel the same way, who want an amazing life filled with authentic self-expression and conscious service.

I want to contribute to the larger healing of the world.

I want to help my tribe live lives that are more aligned to the reality behind the universe, to be more aligned with human nature, to be more aligned with the fundamental spiritual truths - that we are One and not separate, that the divine resides in the ordinary.

What I want to achieve in my work is an extension of what I want to achieve in life.
