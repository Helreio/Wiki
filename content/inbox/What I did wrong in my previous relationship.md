# What I did wrong in my previous relationship

I shut her down. I became less present in the relationship.

I became complacent. I became unconsciously convinced that she will not leave me and thereâ€™s no need to nurture the relationship. That I could just focus on my own growth and she will always be there.

I continued on a relationship that I was not 100% into and my ambivalence influenced how I acted in the relationship.
