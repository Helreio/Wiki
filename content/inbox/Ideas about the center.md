The ultimate goal is to feel Ginhawa

There are multiple ways to feel Ginhawa

But one way to feel Ginhawa is to feel that your actions match your intentions

Deciding what your intentions are

Deciding what your actions are

These two are already a life-long practice.

We facilitate people in this process.

What is our process?

- non-sectarian: belief neutral, it is the only way we can open ourselves to everyone
- Scientific (based on sound philosophy and psychology)
- self-directed
- Field, goal neutral: we dont prescrib a goal, we help you find your goal and pursue it

Our approach is non-sectarian, scientific. But it integrates practices from different sources without the need to subscribe to a particular belief system
