# How good ideas eventually die

I don't know if you notice this but I notice this a lot. People who have big ideas, really good ideas, tend to be so hung up in their ideas that they sabotage their only chance to give legs to them. To give legs to an idea, you need other people's help and support. But a lot of these big idea people lack the social skills necessary to coax that help and support. They annoy the few people who have shown interest and support to their work. How? They become too self-centered, they only talk about themselves and their achievements, about how grand their ideas are. They only reach out to their supporters if they need something or if they have an event or an achievement to boast. They don't show interest on their supporter's ideas, even if that's the only way to truly gain true supporters. Worst of all, they can be exploitative and manipulative sometimes, all for the sake of their idea or their selfish interests.

And this is the reason why many good ideas that should be game-changing never get off the ground. The people surrounding those ideas, who should have been life-long supporters, realizing that they are not valued, eventually lose interest.
