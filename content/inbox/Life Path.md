# Life Path

**Instructions**

Plot your history. List all the cities you’ve lived in, the schools you’ve attended, the jobs you’ve had, the relationships you’ve been in, even the smaller life moments that only you remember. Add musical artists and albums that changed your life, movies that you’ve seen ten times, books you’ve reread. Include people who have had an impact on you, such as the teachers you loved. Get creative and break into your memory bank here!

After plotting your life path, ask yourself the following questions:

1. Whom did you look up to?
2. Whom did you depend on?
3. Who kept you safe emotionally or physically? Who didn’t?
4. Who worried about you when you were feeling stressed?
5. Whom did you take for granted?
6. Did you choose your friends thoughtfully or did you fall into them?
7. When were you running away?
8. When have you played it safe?
9. When did you make excuses?
10. When did you feel most alive and fist-pumping in life?
11. Where have you struggled?
12. What part of your past do you want to forgive?
13. What more do you need?

Sit with your history and get really honest with it. Remember to be gentle with yourself, and without judgment. Imagine your younger self and speak tenderly to her or him. The time you take to get gently aware of your journey thus far will help you see your path forward with more clarity.

Consider doing this exercise with a friend, in a class, or with family members. Sharing it with people you trust can reveal more about you—and them.
