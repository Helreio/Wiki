# Just because a teaching came from a religion doesnt mean it is murky with lies

It is possible that a religion will grow around truth.

The only difference is that that truth was surrounded by people, rituals, and norms that preserve it.

Unlike if that truth just lay there on the hands of lone wolf philosophers

But of course where it gets problematic is when ideas or practices are installed in the truth and because it is a tradition it needs to be preserved. And an individualâ€™s choice and freedom is curtailed by this tradition.
