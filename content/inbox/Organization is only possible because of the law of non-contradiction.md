# Organization is only possible because of the law of non-contradiction

Our mental ability to distinguish between this and that ([[The law of non-contradiction (P is not non-P)]]) is so critical in living well. Without this ability, it is impossible to organize anything from the simplest atom to the most complex societies.

While some would argue that organization is the anthithesis of positive emotions—that we should just "go with the flow" and embrace the mess—I would argue that [[Organization allows us to free up mental space for more positive emotions]].

And, again, organization is only possible because of our mental ability to distinguish between this and that.
