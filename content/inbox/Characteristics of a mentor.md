Went through a life tragedy.

Harnessed emotions. Curated emotions. Used that experience to build a life with the most important things (relationships, health) in check.

Has a platform and writes to help others.

Multipassionate. Brings all of his parts in his work. Philo and psych.

The one you feed?
