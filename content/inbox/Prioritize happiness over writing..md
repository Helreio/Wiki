# Prioritize happiness over writing.

The goal is to be happy.

The goal is not to make it as a writer. To make the blog work, create a vocation that is wonderful, etc, these are all parts of the long way towards happiness.

The shortcut is the small moments. What happens everyday. If you focus on that, will you be able to affect your happiness level? Yes.

So create a system of living that prioritizes these small steps to happiness.
