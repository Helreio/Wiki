# Interaction between mind and matter

If dualism,

Conscious awareness seems to be dependent on physical things (brain, etc.)

And it ceases to exist when the physical vessel dies or degenerates.

There is a tight relationship between the two.

There are degrees of consciousness as well. Which seem to depend on the complexity of physical structures (brain of humans vs animals).

Dualism or neutral monism
