Chou's octagon is a really cool and simple to understand model. But when exposed to philosophical questions, it can be more accurate. For example, what are these motivations that he is telling?

These are feelings and emotions that are triggered by certain information. So if emotions and information have their own metaphysical existence, then their relationship itself has its own metaphysical existence.
