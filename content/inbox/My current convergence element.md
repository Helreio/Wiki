# My current convergence element

Main question: How to live?

# Methods

- Research
- Contemplation (thinking independent of books and other peopleâ€™s content)
- Mindfulness
- Nature excursions and walks
- Conversations
- User-based research (learn-apply-reflect)

# Problems I am interested in

- Answers on this question is monopolized by religious and spiritual groups that require you to believe in their metaphysics. Or academics that are too high to gets. We need the perspective of the ordinary man.
- Academia thinks that this is an unnecessary question to ask sometimes.

# Rules

- Skepticism: I act or engage with a certain information based on my levels of certainty about it.
- Moderate mindedness: I keep an open-mind as much as I can. I listen to oppossing sides even to positions I disagree with.
- Tolerance: It is by developing tolerance that we can coexist in a plural society.
- Maximize individual freedom: Freedom is the precursor to health, well-being, and flourishing.
- Complete existence: Thinking and feeling is necessary for complete living.

This list is by far not complete nor final. This site documents the changes in my mind about these rules.

# What I stand for

I am challenging how people think.

Contemplation

Being moderate

Cautious thinking

Wisdom

Beauty appreciation

How are all these standing for something and againsta a social problem
