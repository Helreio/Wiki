# How to use a spaced repetition writing system in Craft

Once you have learned [[How to setup a spaced repetition writing system in Craft]], implement the system in [[thoughts/my morning writing practice]] using the following steps:

1. Open [[thoughts/things]] and check for the tag to review today.
2. Open the tag in [[craft]] and slowly work on each note linked in the tag.
3. Keep or change the tag of the note depending on what happens when you review it:
   - If the note was interesting and you were able to expand effortlessly, but you need more time, tag it as “Fruitful”.
   - If the note was interesting but it was hard to expand it, tag it as “Unfruitful”.
   - If the note was interesting but you don’t want to work on it right now, tag it as “Skipped”.
   - If the note is no longer interesting, delete it.
   - If the note was interesting and you have expanded it well into a [[Evergreens]], transfer it to your [[Talahardin]].
1. Do this until you have processed all notes for the tag of the day.
2. After processing the tag of the day and you still have time, go back to the writing inbox and review unprocessed and untagged notes. Alternatively, revise existing Permanent notes.
3. As you slowly empty your writing inbox, you will be assigning different tags to different notes. Work on only one tag a day: the tag for that day.
