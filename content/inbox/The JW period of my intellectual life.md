# The JW period of my intellectual life

First serious devotion came on the year before I went to college. I started reading about the history of JWs and other deep doctrines. I remembered talking to Jehovah as if he was a real person. I didn't have a bestfriend and I considered him mine. That was how strong my faith was back then.
