# PIP Ep. 3 - Consciousness and Subjectivity (Dr. Emrys Westacott)

**EW**

Once you use the word “self” you have some work to do to specify what you mean by that term.

**SP**

::The problem of the “self” is a problem of boundaries.::

::The question is: Is there a separate “self”? Is there an independent “self”? Does the self have a boundary?::

::If there is a separate self, one way to make sense of the existence of such is the concept of a “soul."::

::But I don’t really like that conclusion.::

::If the “self” does not have boundaries, then we’ll have to agree with a Hindu mystical conclusion that the phenomenon of mind experience is everywhere. That there are no independent minds. I don’t like this conclusion either.::

**EW**

What’s your take about the science-inspired conclusion that consciousness emerged from the brain and ultimately created a sense of self?

That our concept of self arises from a sense of self, which in turn arises from the fact that consciousness exist as a packaged, attached to bodies.

**SP**

::The way I phrase metaphysical questions is ultimately about boundaries.::

::Is it the case that there is an objective boundary where there is “self” and there is “not-self”?::

::In that circumstance, if the process of evolution results in this phenomenon of consciousness, I don’t think that there is anywhere that you can say yes this point there is a self and at this point there isn’t a self. That means the self is illusory. It certainly is a logical possibility but I have trouble with that.::

::I am drawn towards the dualism of Descartes.::

::I don’t see how you get awareness from bits of matter.::

::I am a reluctant dualist.::

::I can’t easily reconcile subjective experience with physical phenomena.::

**EW**

The only question that matters is how do you get consciousness out of matter (the brain)?

I don’t know. But I assume that’s what happens.

We don’t understand how it happens but I don’t feel a pressing need to posit any things or forces or processes beyond what we can already be knowledgeable about. We just don’t know how the whole thing works.

**SP**

::In my perspective, there’s a complete category distinction between third person matter, the constituents of the physical universe, and the contents of subjective experience.::

::If it were the case that human beings didn’t have this phenomena of awareness, then I think physicalism will be a complete theory.::

::It appears to me that you can't give a complete description of the universe if you leave out this gigantic realm of subjective experience.::

**EW**

“What is it like to be a bat?” by Thomas Nagel

Even if you’ve created a complete description of the physical universe, you have left out a big realm, subjective experience.

Physicalists always seem to reduce subjective experience into physical phenomena.

**SP**

“The Case Against Physicalism”

::If you have described all physical phenomena yet still are leaving something out, then you have to expand your toolbox.::

::If the whole point of trying to understand the universe is to describe things that we’re experiencing, it seems like you’re cutting off half your body if you’re only using physicalist terminology.::

**EW**

::This topic has been so popular because of two problems::

1. ::The problem of consciousness::
2. ::The problem of free will::

::Why did they become pressing issues with huge amount of literature written about them?::

- ::Because of the historical juncture::
- ::The scientific revolution kicks in.::
- ::The core question then is: Does the scientific method give us everything? Or is there phenomena that is beyond the grasp of those methods?::

Subjectivity does not lend itself to the physicalist account.

**SP**

My entire life as a person is proof. I can’t deny that subjective experience is happening. And it is a categorical distinction from physical phenomena.

**EW**

Why can’t consciousness simply be an emergent property like life, an emergent property of the inorganic?

**SP**

It seems that life as it evolves more complexly, it begins to have access to subjective experience, to consciousness.

**EW**

**SP**

Bertrand Russell, neutral monism

- Rejected physicalism (all conceptual tools are physical) or dualism (physical, conceptual, and an impenetrable boundary between the two).
- Third perspective: Ultimately, mind and matter are not fully categorically different. Neither fully explains the world. Both are derivatives of this other stuff we know nothing about.

**EW**

A third stuff is unnecessary.

Hilary Putnam: “The mind and the world jointly make up the mind and the world.”

That’s a better explanation than neutral monism.

The mind is constituted by both mind and world.

The world is constituted by both mind and world.

You can’t explain the mind without referencing the world.

You can’t explain the world without referencing the mind.

**SP**

In that worldview, it doesn’t satisfactorily explains the radicalness of the difference between objective matter and subjective awareness.

**EW**

I agree that there is a difference between objective and subjective.

I agree that at the moment we don’t really understand how it happens.

I agree that subjective experience is mysterious.

But its mystery does not lead me to posit a mysterious substance.

**SP**

It boils down to how bright that distinction is between the objective and the subjective.

If the difference is a metaphysical category distinction, then one cannot give rise to the emergence of the other.

Epiphenomenalism

- What we consider as awareness is an epiphenomenon of physical happenings.
- Analogy: The sound of a steam whistle. The sound emerges just from the movement of atoms.
- This still doesn’t solve the metaphysical question of the subjective and the objective. In fact, it presupposes that there is still this category difference.

**EW**

::Why are you so sure that the problem of consciousness is not analogous to the emergence of life?::

Life is special compared to inorganic matter.

Why can’t it be the same with subjective experience? It emerged out of life. And it is special.

**SP**

::We could have a complete explanation of the emergence of life without consciousness just with the use of the physicalist toolbox.::

::Because in this explanation, we are just talking about the movement of atoms. All that there is just the complex movement of atoms.::

::But when I start to talk about my subjective experience, I’m not talking about any movement of atoms. There might be a correspondence of the movement of atoms in my brain, but I’m talking about the essence of being me, not any movement of atoms.::

::Someone can see the movement of every single atom in my body and say that he could explain my life. But they’re still missing this other thing which is how it feels to be me.::

**EW**

I assume that there is a spectrum of sentients.

Beings do not simply move towards something. They actually have the experience of moving towards something.

Your point of view needs to accommodate this spectrum of sentients.

At some point it’s no longer just biochemistry without awareness but biochemistry with very, very basic primitive element of sentience.

**SP**

In dualism, the boundary between matter and mind is something like a soul.

This is why I am a reluctant dualist.

Because if this is the case then other sentient beings might have souls.

Another problem: where do these souls come from?

Potential solutions

- Neutral monism
- Panpsychism (the potential for conscious awareness is everywhere)

**EW**

Panpsychism is one explanation but it is flamboyantly extravagant that we are components of a bigger consciousness.

**SP**

Panpsychism is not a radical possibility.

A lot of people believe in it after having experiences God’s point of view.

**EW**

Spinoza

- There’s one substance.
- 2 ways of viewing it: matter and mind
- Matter not separate to mind
- They change depending on our point of view

**SP**

If you take the physicalism path, you then have to believe that a rock has the potential to talk about itself. That matter congealed in a way that it gained consciousness and talked about itself. That’s absurd.

Even the idealist perspective which is all things are mental is also absurd to me.

Dualism is also absurd. Panpsychism is absurd. Spinpoza’s theory is absurd.

They’re all absurd and radical.

**EW**

::We shouldn’t be afraid of the absurd.::

::We can’t make full sense of the universe using our ordinary common sense.::

**SP**

While we can’t be certain about a lot of things in metaphysics, we can be certain of this truth: “subjective experience exists.”

Analogy

- We wake up, we’re in the ocean.
- A life raft drifts our way. Now we can start somewhere.

Using the truth of subjective experience, you can make a grounded progress instead of drowning in the ocean of philosophy.

Our minds have access to "certain truths.” This is hopeful.

**EW**

I distinguish between truth and certainty.

Descartes demanded certainty. And for a large extent, philosophers of the 20th century uncritically went along with that demand.

Even today, a lot of philosophers think that philosophical truth should more or less be analytic.

They’re more interested in the analysis of concepts. They’re not interested in vague plausible empirical generalizations.

I don’t agree with that.

I actually think that certainty is very hard to establish in many spheres.

There are degrees of certainty.

High degree of certainty:

- Subjective experience
- Mathematics

I feel like we should not fret too much if some of our knowledge is not certain.

Just accept.

Aristotle: “Do not demand more certainty in a field of knowledge than it’s capable of delivering.”

**SP**

I agree with you as long as there is a degree of certainty.

Any proposition that contradicts certain truths are wrong.

**EW**

::Once you allow a sliding scale of certainty you have to be comfortable with the fact that most human knowledge is uncertain.::

**SP**

There are foundational truths.

But most human knowledge is uncertain.

**EW**

I’m uncomfortable with the word “foundational” because you are implying that you are going to build the rest of human knowledge through that foundation.

**SP**

It’s perfectly fine to say: "I don’t know if the physical world exists. But if it does, here’s what follows and here’s how it works.”

We can’t have 100% certainty that a physical world exists. But it’s foundational in building our worldview.
