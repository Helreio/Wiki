# Insight vs conclusion

- Insight vs conclusion
   - Insight doesn't seem to come from thought. One can say it is triggered by something, but that something is not information.
   - There might always be role that physical world or movement plays.
   - Insight could happen as part of a thread of thought. But it isn't clear how it is related to the thread.
   - A conclusion however scaffolds on initial thoughts and can only be generates by analyzing those thoughts together.

Insight is thought that is not born out of another thought. It can be part of a thread of thought, but there is always a space between the thread and the insight. A conclusion is directly connected to a set of prepositions, which can only be deduced through careful analysis. An insight can be a conclusion to a thread of thought, but its coming is surprising, takes time, happens at unexpected moments as if it comes from somewhere else and not the author.
