# Simplicity and Complexity

Yes I desire complexity for my overall strategy.

But I would like to maintain simplicity and focus on my every day life.

A complex future.

A simple now.

One I can easily manage.

One that speaks to my soul.

Because that is the most important objective.

The richness made possible by a simple life.
