# LPR Plan

Lifestyle Changes

- Eat frequent, small meals.
- Lose weight.
- Do not eat food less than 2 hours before bedtime.
- Raise the head of your bed before sleeping. Place a strong, solid object (like a board) under the top portion of the mattress. This will help prop up your head and the upper portion of your body, which will help keep stomach acid from backing up into your throat.
- Avoid clearing your throat.
- Do not wear tight or binding clothing.
- Avoid becoming overly stressed.
