# My Research and Writing Interests

What I am interested about studying and writing

1. Big ideas
2. Practical application of these to the self
3. Practical application of these to society

I have never been interested studying something for the sake of just knowing it. I do not stop there. I always question myself, why is this relevant to me? What can this help me with?

My deep understanding of the universe was aimed to "justify" the actions I am taking.

Knowledge directs and inspires me on the action I should take.
