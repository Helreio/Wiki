Yesterday, I...

saw a cat. A beautiful, white-furred cat, drinking water from the side of the road. Possibly from the recent rains that interluded LB's summer, not as hot as our summer's back in Pangasinan but hot nonetheless. Possibly tap water that fell from the roof of someone's car after washing or someone's hose from gardening. Wherever the water came from, I hope it's clean.

If not, then bacteria, then high WBC levels in the cat. And no one would know because no one "owns" the cat. No one will bring her (I prefer to think she was a girl) to the vet.

I saw her while walking right after bringing Champy, the younger of the two cats I adopted (or abducted?), to a new vet. We ended up waiting for about an hour (or more) because one of the two British short haired cats that came before us was an "evil cat" (vet's words not mine). I left Champy inside the clinic with her two co-species, apparently the most behave (vet's words again).

Perhaps, there is something about being a stray that makes a cat different from those who were born in this world in a better situation. For sure there is. But often times we think they should be a little more brusque than their more fortunate counterparts.

Weird. But a lot of these strays are actually quite beautiful, quite more mannered, more calm, and never short of affection.

There is just too much good in the world that it spills over even on the side of the streets.
