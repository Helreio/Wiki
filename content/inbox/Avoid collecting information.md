# Avoid collecting information

[[Collecting information does not extend personal knowledge]]. Instead of just collecting information, [[Use a reading inbox to capture useful reading materials]], take [[literature notes]] while reading ([[how to write literature notes]]), then convert these literature notes into [[Evergreens]] ([[how to convert literature notes to permanent notes]]).

One form of collecting information is reading. When people read something interesting, they will remember it in a few days and exhibit [[After-reading glow]]. But they soon forget about it because they have simply collected information in their brain and failed to externalize the information into a system like [[Talahardin]]. Without taking literature notes, you are just collecting concepts in your memory. Since memory is flawed, you eventually forget about what you read. Thus, [[Reading without note-taking is only beneficial in the short-term]]. Some read and take highlights, but never process these ([[The problems of highlighting]]).

To prevent us from collecting information, implement a short research cycle repeatedly.

To do

- Write a complete note on this short research cycle you are referring to.
