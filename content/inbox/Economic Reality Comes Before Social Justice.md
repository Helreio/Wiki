# Economic Reality Comes Before Social Justice

21 Highlights from Economic Reality Comes Before Social Justice

---

Progressives are masters of indignation. They see injustice everywhere, whether political, social, professional, or economic – wherever humans interact with each other. Regardless of the context, their solution is always the same: more government regulation.

---

Progressives also love to use “rights” language

---

While these statements certainly sound nice, there’s one problem: They ignore reality.

---

Before talking about “how things should be”, it would seem wise to first understand “how things actually work”. If you want to understand how the world works, you must understand economics.

---

Murray Rothbard so accurately said: It is no crime to be ignorant of economics, which is, after all, a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a ‘dismal science.’ But it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance.

---

Progressives have a particularly poor track record when it comes to economics. Not only are their theories confused, but they’ve concretely demonstrated – for a century – that their central planning does far more harm than good.

---

Any political theory devoid of sound economic reasoning is useless at best and dangerous at worst.

---

Before talking about what jobs, wages, and healthcare people are entitled to, we must ask: how do jobs, wages, and healthcare come into existence? How do the systems work? Economic goods and services do not appear in nature; poverty is the natural state of mankind, and wealth is the exception. So how do humans become wealthy?

---

It’s not by government degree. It’s not through central planning. It’s through markets – free markets.

---

A good rule of thumb: if you don’t yet understand why the minimum wage causes unemployment, keep digging deeper.

---

All economic truths are based on a foundational principle: resources are scarce. Meaning, there isn’t enough stuff for everybody to get everything they want. Thus, resources must somehow be allocated.

---

It’s not an easy question: how should scarce resources be allocated?

---

Contrary to intuition, the best allocation method is to have no pre-planned allocation at all. You simply let people trade by themselves, absent planning or design, and wealth gets created.

---

there are too many moving parts to the economy to think you can plan it out. Too much knowledge for anybody to have. Instead, markets use an extraordinarily efficient pricing system to allocate resources to their optimal use.

---

This kind of allocation takes place with literally every economic good, from health care to tennis shoes. Economic laws do not change depending on the good. The production of sweaters is not intrinsically different than the production of food, water, housing, and health services.

---

Unfortunately, their rhetoric persuades lots of people. Couple this with a democratic government, and you’ve got a recipe for systemic poverty.

---

News for the progressive: you don’t get fed because of laws. You aren’t dodging killer consumer-products because of the FDA. It’s despite government regulation that wealth is created. You get fed because functioning prices, profits, and losses within a market system. Without it, you’d undoubtedly starve, regardless of the law – the history of communism confirms this.

---

It’s not a perfect solution, because there is no perfect solution. Scarcity necessarily means some people’s desires will remain unsatisfied. It’s simply the best solution possible, given the imperfect circumstances.

---

But unfortunately, this kind of counter-productive nonsense is precisely the modus operandi of progressives. They take moral positions, not rooted in reality, and persuade voters by appealing to emotional rhetoric – on a perpetual “quest for cosmic justice”, as Thomas Sowell puts it.

---

Fundamentally, claiming a “everybody has a right to affordable housing” is no different than claiming, “Everybody has a right to a refrigerator, two television sets, a car, several pairs of clothes, and broadband internet access!” Nevermind any concern for how these good actually get produced, or what the concrete effects of government micromanagement would be.

---

All political and social theories must first be rooted in reality; they have to be grounded in sound economics. Otherwise, they are hopelessly doomed to inaccurate, fanciful conclusions.
