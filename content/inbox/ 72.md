The book Self-help started the genre in 1859. Originally, the book was a reaction to quick fixes. Colin Dickey, in his history of self-help said that the problem of the genre is that it has returned the quickfix pseudoscientific cures that the original Self-help book reacted to.

The best self-help books are accidental. They were enduring because they were written by the authors primarily for the authors themselves.

Write self-help not as a guru but as a fellow student.

This is the foundation of self-help, after all: unlock the secrets that make me better, and then tell me what to do. Give me actionable intelligence, make me more creative, increase the percentage of solutions I’m able to devise. Give me a plan because I’m incapable of making my own; give me a plan because mine isn’t working.

because it is so largely untapped by folks with literary or artistic ambitions, self-help is actually a genre ripe for experimentation.

Good self-help books

- Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
- Tiny Beautiful Things by Cheryl Strayed
- How to be a person in the world? By Heather Havrilesky
- What if this were not enough? By Heather Havrilesky
- You must change your life by Rilke

What self-help needs is authors willing to screw with it, to mix it with other forms and breed mongrels, to give it equal doses of honesty and weirdness.
