Deep transformation

Holism

Resistance to binaries

Material exchange is the basis of gender discrimination

We need to move from unequal exchange to egalitarian exchange to a gift paradigm

The relationship

Provide the best for people we love

Theorizing the gift economy makes us realize how deep we have to change.

Gift economy things flow.

When you engage in any exchange even if it is fair, you engage in that exchange to get what you want not because the other person needs what you need

Exchange interrupts human relationship

Economic becomes separate from the relationship

He is not a friend. He is just a customer.

Deep and serious interruption.

Egalitarian or profiting exchange both requires that you need to measure the value of two very different things

To do that you’ll us me another thing to measure against: money

When you measure things, they become other than what they are. They become the basis of inequality. One gender, race, is superior than another.

Nature is gift

Gifting as an economy does not persist and once it persists it is distorted

Things flow where they are needed.

This requires that we listen. Who needs what?

In gift economies, people know who needs what.

All of us were born into the gift.

Gender and class alienated us from one another

Exchange economy is patriarchal

Gift economy is matriarchal

In a gift economy, everyone is matriarchal

Care is important

The assumption is that we became social when we began measuring things. Before that, we were primitive.

In a matriarchy, there is no value judgment on one gender over the other.

Gift is relationship. It isn’t separate.

Exchange is a relationship to yourself not to the other person. You exchange because what they have you need.

Exchange is a relationship because you need somethhing or you want something.

The things also dont become as they are. They become commodities.

Disconnection from the gift economy is gendered, gender is a structure of power

Start by noticing

There are more gifts happening in our lives more than exchange
