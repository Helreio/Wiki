# A belief in God is not "irrational". Because you can "imagine" him (or her) depending on what you believe about him (or her).

What is "irrational" is a belief that, for example, square circles exist. You can't imagine that (no matter how much you believe in it) by virtue of it being unintelligble by your brain.

The existence of God is plausible.

The existence of a square circle is impossible (and beyond sanity!)

A square circle is an example of a logical contradiction.

Logical contradictions are also called "true paradoxes".

True paradoxes cannot exist both in the mind (as concepts) and in the physical world (as things).

In short, they cannot exist in any universe.

One can believe in them. But it doesn't mean that they are really there.
