# Walk Slowly

Walk slowly

Amidst the fields

Lest you miss

A tiny leaf

Fall from the branches

Of an unnamed tree

Down the little streams

Of water

From rivers and falls

You will never know

Walk slowly my friend

For there is enough tomorrow

But there is only one today

Walk

As if for the last time

You will walk this world

Barefooted

Naked

Free and wild

For you have your feet

And they are with you now

And you have your strength

To take those little steps

Walk slowly

As if your life depends on it

Because it does

(Written with chirping birds after one of my afternoon walks)
