# Validation is for parking - Austin Kleon

Nobody’s gonna give you [permission](https://austinkleon.com/2017/03/27/permission/).

Nobody’s gonna welcome you into the club.

Nobody’s gonna pat you on the back and say “well done.”

All you can do is keep making [the work you want to see in the world](https://austinkleon.com/2018/09/08/do-the-work-you-want-to-see-done/).
