# Global COVID response caused the greatest QALY reduction in history

the global response to COVID-19 will cause the greatest quality-adjusted life-year reduction in history.

the underlying mortality risk from COVID is less than the seasonal flu. For the elderly, it becomes significantly worse.

the risk-benefit calculation is poor and skews towards the QALY protection of the elderly and infirm.

The lockdowns caused enormous economic damage, which immediately causes life-year reductions

psychological damage from losing jobs, being discriminated against for health choices, and forced masking.

Children who have been forced to participate in this charade are going to have lasting physical and mental damage (not least of which is the impossibility of rationally judging risk).

The vaccines have known and unknown side-effects

the vaccine does not seem to confer much protection, especially after a few months.

the political aspect of governments around the world dividing and controlling people--or imprisoning them outright--nor the censorship of speech, which adds to anger and division. Totalitarianism causes serious damage to QA life-years--unless, that is, you are one part of the ruling class.

When the inevitable political reckoning happens, it will cause political instability, which will contribute to another life-year reduction, perhaps for decades or centuries.

All of it was unnecessary. There could have been literally zero governmental reaction to COVID-19, and we would have been infinitely better off. Medical professionals could have freely shared information, warned others of a new virus, and there never would have been a pandemic of note. The damage would have mainly been restricted to the elderly.

we had a mixture of religious and political fanaticism

academics, seething for decades at their own incompetence and irrelevance, had an opportunity to feel special and exercise power.

The ruling class, always eager to seize more political power, successfully utilized one of their most powerful weapons, the media, to whip people into a frenzy.

the persecution of humans who choose to be unvaccinated with a low-quality vaccine. And it's only going to get worse and more extreme.

this totalitarianism has the same fuel now as it did in the 20th century: most people are empty inside, broken, apathetic, and nihilistic. They have tolerated so many lies that it has injured their soul. The religious impulse has, once again, been hijacked by political fanaticism. And given the extreme connectivity of the world, the net damage caused will be greater than last time.

The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is **a measure of the value of health outcomes**. Since health is a function of length of life and quality of life, the QALY was developed as an attempt to combine the value of these attributes into a single index number.
