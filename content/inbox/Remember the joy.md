# Remember the joy

The joy you felt when you learned you were a multipotentialite.

The joy you felt when you wanted to start a business, then a blog.

The joy you felt when you can't sleep because you were percolating ideas about what to do.

Remember the joy

Because that joy is the true joy

That is the true flow

Being alive

With one's own thoughts

Independent of any other person

That joy was possible then

It is more than possible now
