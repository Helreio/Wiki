# On Eradicating all forms of irrationality

To eradicate all forms of irrationality religion is wrong. I dont think it is impossible to make reason corxistent with cultural beliefs. Many of religions are already a way of life.

What should be eradicated is fundamentalism and radicalism.

Young members of a culture or faith should be given the opportunity to choose between reason and faith.
