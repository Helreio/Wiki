# Doctors for Covid Ethics Letters

Doctors for Covid Ethics communicated with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) via letters.

DCE wrote three open letters to the EMA about the dangers of the vaccine.

According to DCE, risks of clotting, bleeding, and platelet abnormalities were ruled out in legitimate empirical trials before human use. They warned of the dangers of the vaccine even before the suspensions of vaccines due to blood clots around the world.

# Letter #1 (emailed Feb. 28 + hand-delivered March 1)

- a wide range of side effects is being reported following vaccination of previously healthy younger individuals with the gene-based COVID-19 vaccines
- there have been numerous media reports from around the world of care homes being struck by COVID-19 within days of vaccination of residents
- there has been and there continues to be inadequate scrutiny of the possible causes of illness or death under these circumstances, and especially so in the absence of post-mortems examinations.
- we question whether cardinal issues regarding the safety of the vaccines were adequately addressed prior to their approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

DCE requests:

1. DCE requests evidence that the vaccines disseminate throughout the body through the bloodstream.
2. If there is no evidence that the vaccine disseminates throughout the body via the bloodstream, the DCE argues that the vaccines are entrapped in the circulation particularly where there is slow blood flow.

Chain of events leading to adverse reactions from the vaccine:

1. Platelet count drops
2. D-dimers appear in the blood
3. Myriad ischaemic lesions appear in the body including the brain, spinal cord, and heart.
4. Bleeding disorders occur next: profuse bleedings and haemorrhagic stroke.

The spike protein of the virus could bind with receptor and get activated. Activation was reported to result in Thrombocytopenia. This occurs in both infected and vaccinated patients.

TO DO: Research on Thrombocytopenia

The virus swept the globe with many illnesses and deaths. By the time the vaccines were approved, countries were no longer in imminent threat because many were already infected and the worst of the pandemic is over. DCE questions the EMA whether it indeed granted the release of the vaccines during a time of emergency.

There are serious concerns, including but not confined to those outlined above, that the approval of the COVID-19 vaccines by the EMA was premature and reckless, and that the administration of the vaccines constituted and still does constitute “human experimentation”, which was and still is in violation of the Nuremberg Code.

# EMA Reply to Letter#1 (March 23)

Although no safety signal linked to coagulation disorders was seen in the large clinical trials, which included several thousands of individuals, more data were provided during the enhanced safety monitoring that is in place for all COVID-19 vaccines. It is in this context that cases of thrombocytopenia were reported which led to an investigation for Comirnaty, Moderna and Astra Zeneca COVID-19 vaccines which is currently ongoing.

The continuous safety monitoring also found reports of a combination of thrombocytopenia and thromboembolism with the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca which led to an urgent investigation which concluded on 18 March. EMA’s safety committee, PRAC, concluded that the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases thromboembolism associated with thrombocytopenia, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. There were 18 reports of CVST and 7 reports of disseminated intravascular coagulation, out of around 20 million people vaccinated with the vaccine as of March 16. A causal link with the vaccine is not proven but deserves further analysis. Overall, the benefits of the vaccine in combating the still widespread threat of COVID-19 (which itself results in clotting problems and may be fatal) continue to outweigh the risk of side effects.

# Letter #2 Rebuttal (April 1, 2021)

Our concerns arise from multiple lines of evidence, including that the SARS-CoV-2 “spike protein” is not a passive docking protein, but its production is likely to initiate blood coagulation via multiple mechanisms.

The evidence is clear that there are some serious adverse event risks & that **a number of people, not at risk from SARS-CoV-2, have died following vaccination.**

DCE are asking for data. But EMA is unable to provide them.

EMA cannot provide quantitative data that the vaccines enter the bloodstream.

Auto-attack could not have been excluded in animals unless they had been immunologically primed beforehand. We demand evidence that such experiments had been performed. Similar experiments have been undertaken before with previous, unsuccessful candidate vaccines, and fatal, antibody-dependent enhancement of disease was observed.

We requested scientific evidence, not a vague description of what was purportedly seen in non-valid animal experiments. Your cursory mention of laboratory findings in humans is cynical.

After delivery of our letter to you on March 1, events followed that debunk your response to our last three queries to an extent that can only be termed embarrassing. As we feared, severe and fatal coagulopathies occurred in young individuals following “vaccination”, leading 15 countries to suspend their AZ-“vaccination” program. An official investigation by the EMA into the cases of afflicted younger individuals followed, the results of which were announced by the WHO on March 17, 2021, stating: “At this time, WHO considers that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations continue.”

**But in fact, your Press Release rendered it glaringly apparent that the AZ-“vaccine” does have the potential to trigger intravascular coagulation, that the true risks far outweigh any theoretical benefits, and that any authority with the slightest sense of responsibility must suspend its further use.**

Because of the **unreliability of PCR testing** and because of the **completely novel way that deaths ‘with covid19’ are determined**, the value of 52 is an over-estimate of the real burden of disease, further weakening your already-inadequate claim for risk-benefit.

How, then, can you declare that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks?

CSVT, cerebral venous thrombosis, is **always** a life-threatening condition that demands immediate medical attention. The number of cases you conceded had occurred can represent just the tip of a huge iceberg. As you must know, the most common symptoms of CSVT are piercing headache, blurred vision, nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, stroke-like symptoms occur including impairment of speech, vision and hearing, body numbness, weakness , decreased alertness and loss of motoric control.

Surely, you are not oblivious to the fact that countless individuals suffered from precisely such symptoms directly following “vaccinations” with **all** the experimental gene-based agents.

Clot formation in deep leg veins can lead to lethal pulmonary embolisms. Surely you must know that peripheral venous thromboses have repeatedly been reported following “vaccinations” with **all** the experimental gene-based agents

Microthromboses in the lung vasculature can lead to misdiagnosis of pneumonia. In combination with false-positive PCR (with high cycle thresholds), these will then be registered as COVID 19 cases. Surely you must know that this scenario has probably repeatedly taken place following “vaccinations” with **all** the experimental gene- based agents.

In all events, extensive thrombi formation can lead to consumption of platelets and coagulation factors, resulting in hemorrhagic diathesis and bleeding at all possible locations. Surely you must know that profuse skin bleedings have repeatedly been observed following “vaccinations” with **all** the experimental gene-based agents.

Given that there is a mechanistically plausible explanation for these thromboembolic adverse drug reactions (TE ADRs), namely that the gene-based products induce human cells to manufacture potentially pro-thrombotic spike protein, the reasoned & responsible assumption must now be that this may be a class effect. In other words, the dangers must be ruled out for all emergency-authorised gene-based vaccines, not merely the AZ product.

failure to inform “vaccine” recipients of the risks and negligible benefits outlined here represents serious violations of medical ethics and citizens’ medical rights. Those violations are especially grave as all the risks we describe can be expected to increase with each re-vaccination, and each intervening coronavirus exposure. This renders both repeated vaccination and common coronaviruses dangerous to young and healthy age groups, for whom — in the absence of “vaccination” — COVID-19 poses no substantive risk.

Even under the terms of their own original FDA authorization, COVID-19 vaccines are deemed “investigational” and their recipients “human subjects”, who are, by definition, entitled to informed consent.

Misleading populations into accepting investigational agents such as the gene-based COVID-19 “vaccines”, or coercing them through “vaccine passports”, constitutes clear and egregious violations of the Nuremberg Code. The Nuremberg Code mandates voluntary informed consent “without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit [or] duress”

# EMA reply to Letter (May 25)

At the time the marketing authorisations were granted for the COVID-19 vaccines, the non-clinical and clinical studies did not include analysis of D-dimers because no cardiovascular impairments were observed that would have justified such a test. Given the recent developments, in order to assess the impact of the possible link between vaccination and coagulation, EMA has requested the four marketing authorisation holders to provide a series of additional analyses

It is important to clarify that at the time our first set of responses was sent to you, a causal relationship between rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets and Vaxzevria had not yet been established. EMA’s safety committee, PRAC, concluded on 7 April that very rare cases thromboembolism associated with thrombocytopenia, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis may occur very rarely with Vaxzevria. PRAC also concluded that the benefits of Vaxzevria still outweighed its risks in adults of all age groups.

# My Thoughts

DCE warned EMA about blood disorders caused by the vaccine. Within days, more than a dozen countries withdrew AstraZeneca vaccine because of deaths from clotting and bleeding.
