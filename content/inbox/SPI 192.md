# SPI 192

Lay the foundation first

- Identify your target audience
- Understand your target audience

Write on Medium

- Just to practice writing

Arbitrage

- Buy websites and selling them

Build something for the long-term

- Build something people will continue to come back to

2 ways to start

1. Pick a message, put up a platform, build an audience. Start a blog or a podcast.
2. Cold call business and extract ideas from them. Build a solution/product out of the call.

Time management

- One burst then long free time

Sites no need to build an audience

- Udemy - no need to build an audience
- Etsy - physical products

Itâ€™s best to have your own website even if you have a following in different places.

Niche site

- Website that is static, finite amount of information
- Give information they need to grow
