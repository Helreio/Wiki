# Aspire for mild success instead of wild success.

Mild success is achieved not by luck but by habits and daily work. And that work has to be sustainable. Being wildly successful is useless when you suddenly stop. Whatâ€™s better is to be doing this in the long-run. So:

- Keep sharing your voice and your vision.
- Work to make your work useful to others.
- Develop slow organic growth.
- Increase your chance for serendipitous luck.
