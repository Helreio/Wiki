# Other Responses to Aimee's Feedback

I agree that we all resemble multipotentialites. This is the problem I have with labels. All labels are constructs anyways.

Suffice it to say, the subject of multipotentiality isn't pop psychology. There are studies about it and we event wont have this word without these studies because it is originally a psychological term. Scientists found a trend among some students who have difficulty choosing a career path. And they saw this in contrast to those who seem to have no problem about this.

I agree that multipotentialite like all other labels can be overused and put people into a pedestal. This is a problem that psychology has always contended with.

Nevertheless, identities have their uses. We can only talk about something if we have identified it. Whether multipotentiality exists or not, it is a useful label esp for those who find this a perplexing issue in their entire life. I don't think it is a good idea to dismiss the experiences of all these people altogether. If multipotentiality is a myth, it is a useful myth that we can use to navigate this conversation better.

I have a feeling that multipotentiality is not necessarily a natural trait like introversion. Maybe it has always been in human beings but because of the industrial revolution, that created a culture of specialization, this trait was lost and it reemerged as an aberation.

I do believe that all of us can be multipotentialites. One of my all time favorite books is ERE and its premise is that in order for us to be more financially resilient we need to be embrace the renaissance ideal. The more skills we have, the lesser we become dependent to money.

I will still stand with the framework because I think it is universal. Time is all we have and passions can only be nurtured thru time. I disagree that you can never do anything to rearrange even the most oppressed life.

Where I may have given an incomplete picture is not providing time because they are not important.

Although I also think that there is wisdom in the cliche kung gusto may paraan. A lot of single moms have find ways to provide time for their passions because it is important to them. A mom who claims to be passionate about something may indeed not be able to dedicate time to it "now", but she should really be honest, is she really just a vicitm of the system? Does she really dont have anything else she can do find the time she needs? How much of her plight is

While the statement if you havent given time to it it isnt important to you might be hasty generalization, I think the same can be said to the statement that everyone of us are just victims of the system.

On the prerequisites of creation

The main point of the article was about creating

I also want to say something about the framework I introduced. I stand to my argument that to be able to pursue multiple passions at the same time it is all about time. Even a solo working mom can still be helped by this. I disagree that it is impossible to change the variables, that the victim of the system or the oppressor cannot change her lot in life. I sincerely believe that a mom can change the variables in her life to make time. Changing the system, lobbying the government, or finishing a revolution to topple off capitalism, these are things beyond a single mom's control but why would she wait for these things to change if she can do things herself? Napoint out mo rin naman that writers were able to do it. You were able to do it. So you are a proof that variables can be rearranged (at least the variables I mentioned: money, health, and life system) can be tweaked to make more time and make quality time. There is no other way to pursue multiole projects than to dedicate more time to them. Is there any other way?

Again I want to sincerely express my appreciation for this reaction. This was my first time to receive a critical feedback on my work and I realize na sobrang useful din pala nito. Kailangan ko rin ito. Sa FLOW o sa Tungko ay napakaprotected natin from critical remarks, which really worked for me lalo na nung nagsisimula palang. At kailangan ko pa rin naman ng ganong space parati. Pero I realize now that I actually want this so I can grow more in a different way. Namiss ko to. Dati meron ako nito sa college.

Salamat. I hope you continue to be frank to me.

If I am going to rewrite the blog I would change the voice into the I voice. I realized i sounded more like a lectuter that someone who is sharing his own story.

All advice is autobiographical. Therefore there is no advice that will capture every single aspect of society.

The article was also not written for the people you mentioned. If you are in the situations you mentioned, you are now who I am writing to. I am writing for someone who intends to pursue his/her multipotentiality, not someone who is doubting it

Every conscious human being has agency. No matter what his or her situation is, she can begin to change it because there are always things within her control. If not her entire situation then her response to the situation. Now choice niya yun if she'll continue to view herself as a victim of society. So what if you're a victim. Injustice is unavoidable. It is how things are. We can't control that. But we have control over our responses to our situations. And that agency, that is a prerequisite for creation.

My persoective is incomplete but that should be expected because i never intended to capture a complete theory of creativity. It is based on my experience. I just hope that even if you disagree to most of the lessons I learned from 7 years of trying this work for myself, is that you also put my words in context. They are mine and what worked for me and they are still true because of that and they will work for others who are like me, probably not the most disaadvantaged members of society but they will work.
