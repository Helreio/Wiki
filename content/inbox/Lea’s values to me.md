# Leaâ€™s values to me

1. Presence. Without her, I'll be alone here in LB most of the time as I am away from parents and my friends have their own lives.
2. Someone to talk to.
3. Someone I can be intimate with.
4. Someone I can tell my troubles and fears.
5. A partner I am able to talk differences with.
6. A partner who adores me and who is very less critical of me. Who always see the good in me and people first.
7. A partner who is intelligent and articulate.
8. A partner who integrates well with my friends.
