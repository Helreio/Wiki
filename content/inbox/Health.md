# Health

Health is an interesting concept. Is health subjective? Or can we objectively make sense of it?

There seems to be two conditions where health could be objective:

1. The platonic realm exists and it has a form for health.
2. An objective conceptualization of health is achieved by using science to extract generalities among human beings.

[[Steve Patterson]] once said that death is the opposite of health. This implies that health = being alive. But if this is the case, are martyrdoms unhealthy? And is self-preservation the healthiest form of being?
