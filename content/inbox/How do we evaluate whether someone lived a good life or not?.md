# How do we evaluate whether someone lived a good life or not?

For example, did Nietszche had a bad life just because bad things happened to him? Did Thoreau had a better life because he didn’t turn mad?

I think a bad life is when, on situations when you were in control, you acted wrongly relative to the goals you set for yourself.

Therefore a good life is a life where in situations and areas one has control, one has acted correctly relative to one’s goals.

A good life does not depend on external things that we can’t totally control. We can only control our attention and actions. The success or failure of our lives should only be judged based on the things we can control.
