# BE YOURSELF. PEOPLE WILL THANK YOU. - Elizabeth Gilbert

Dear Ones -

Here's a simple message for you, this Sunday morning:

BE YOURSELF. PEOPLE WILL THANK YOU.

One of the main obstacles I see — whenever I talk to people about why they aren't living their most creative or satisfying life — is that they don't want to be selfish.

Because following your passions is selfish, right?

And who wants to be selfish?

We are all good and decent people here, and we all want to live good and decent lives. We all want to be modest and giving. We all want to be seen as generous souls, who put others before ourselves. We want to be people who care about humanity.

But there seems to be this crazy idea floating around out there that — if we decide to bloom into our fullest being — we will be doing so at the expense of others.

To be an artist? Selfish.

To take a class in a subject that fascinates you? Selfish.

To focus on changing your health or getting you body into shape? Selfish. IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU.

To leave an unhappy marriage, rather than white-knuckling your way through it like a tormented martyr? Selfish.

To be a traveler? Selfish.

To follow a deep and passionate dream? Selfish.

To move to a new city or country, because you're curious about what sort of person you might become in a new setting? Selfish.

To change the way you think, or dress, or express yourself? Selfish as hell. HEY — STOP TRYING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO YOURSELF!

To explore different ways of finding God? Selfish, and maybe even sinful. WHO DO YOU YOU THINK YOU ARE — SPECIAL?

And so — all too many times — we don't explore ourselves to the fullest extent. We don't allow ourselves to come into being. We don't do any of the stuff that would allow for the fullest expression of our individuality. Because we don't want to look like we think we are special. Because we don't want to act entitled.

Because we don't want to be selfish.

But I had a conversation about this the other day with my marvelous friend Pastor Rob Bell, and he put a spin on this subject that I'd never heard before — and I want to share it with you today.

Here's the thing he brought up: Have you ever met one of your heroes in real life? Maybe an artist or a musician or an author or a thought leader, whose work and mission have totally inspired you?

What was the first thing you said to your hero, when you met them in person?

I promise you it was these two words: "THANK YOU".

When I met Tom Waits, for instance, the first thing I said to him was, "Thank you. Thank you so much for your work. Thank you so much for what you do."

I said the same thing when I met Anne Lamott. I said the same thing when I met Brene Brown, Billy Collins, Hilary Mantel, B.B. King, Jimmy Carter, Bonnie Raitt, and most certainly Oprah Winfrey. (Actually, I say "Thank you" every single time I see Oprah Winfrey. I say "Thank you" to Oprah every time she turns around. I say "thank you" every time she takes a breath. She's probably getting sick of it. But I can't stop saying it.)

But here is the question Rob Bell posed to me: When we meet our heroes, and we thank them, what exactly are we thanking them FOR?

Because, as Rob pointed out to me, they should be the ones thanking US, right? Because we — through our love and devotion — are the ones who are supporting THEM, literally speaking. Because we're the ones who have been buying their books, downloading their movies, listening to their music for decades, or buying tickets to their events, right?

If you spend 200 bucks on a ticket to see Bruce Springsteen and then you get to meet him, and you say, "Thank you!", isn't that kind of weird? I mean, it's not like Bruce Springsteen just gave YOU 200 bucks. You're the one who's paying for the renovations on HIS beach house; not the other way around...am I right?

I mean, what do these people really give us, in the end? Why do we so desperately feel the need to thank them, even as we are pouring our money and our support into their existence?

Here is the answer:

WE ARE THANKING THEM FOR THE WAY THEY HAVE LIVED THEIR LIVES.

We thank them, because by living their own lives with truth and passion and courage, they somehow made our lives better.

How did they make our lives better?

They made our lives better by being themselves. They made our lives better by expressing themselves fully. ::They modeled power for us, by following their curiosity and passion. By speaking out, they modeled courage for us. By letting us see their vulnerability and their emotional evolution, they modeled transformation for us. They showed us how to BE.::

They showed us how to show up.

And this doesn't just go for celebrities. Think of the non-famous people you have met in your everyday journey who are fully living their own lives — who are unapologetically themselves. Think of your coolest aunt or uncle, your favorite funky and funny neighbor, the most bad-ass waitress at your favorite diner. Think of how good it feels to be around them. Think of the universe of possibility it opens within you, when you see how firmly they stand within their own being. Think of how much bigger your world seems, when you see how big they have allowed their own worlds to become.

Think about how their freedom makes you feel more free.

This is why we thank the people who influence us — for showing us the possibility of our own freedom.

In other words — ::you're so afraid that by living your own life, you will be perceived as selfish...but perhaps living your own life is the biggest gift you can offer the world.::

Perhaps ::being yourself is the LEAST selfish thing you can do.::

(Now, let's be honest here, because we are all adults living in the real world: It may not be your family members who thank you, in the end, for being yourself. Remember: a family is a tightly run and often oppressive corporation — and they don't like their employees to stray from the company line. This might be painful for you — to know that you have disrupted the way your family does things. But every hero in the world, I betcha, disrupted the way their family does things. It can be hard to disappoint your relatives. But not as hard or as painful, in the end, as living forever within the depressing confines of a life that is not your own. So let that be, and let that go.)

Ultimately, I promise you this: If you allow yourself to come fully into being, there will be people who thank you for it.

It will be seen as a community service.

Trust me on this one.

You will be doing the world the greatest possible kindness by being exactly who you are.

ONWARD,

LG
