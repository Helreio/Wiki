# The perception of free will is undeniable

[[Free will]] may or may not ultimately exist, but its perception is undeniable. This perception is what bridges [[thoughts/metaphysics]] and [[thoughts/epistemology]] to [[praxeology]], [[psychology]], and [[thoughts/ethics]].

If it is an illusion, then it is a very useful illusion, one that we can use to live a fulfilling life. If it is indeed not an illusion then all the better!

To do

- Extend this note by reviewing Steve Patterson's writings on free will.
