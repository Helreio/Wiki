# Step-by-step guide to living

THEORY

Understand how you understand.

- The three rules that make anything intelligible

Understand what the universe is made of (and this includes you).

- Subjective experience exists
- An external objective physical world exists
- The autonomy and mutual exclusivity of the subjective and the objective
- How the objective and the subjective interact
- Volition exists
- Morality does not exist

Understand how you act

- Action is conscious movement towards ends
- Ends are ultimately mental states
- We choose to act a certain way based on rational and irrational influences

PRACTICE

Touch base to what you want (remember the feelings).

Give a label to these feelings

Probably two books

- A book of proofs to your beliefs
- A book of how these beliefs could be applied to the question "how to live?"
