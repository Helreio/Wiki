# I always wonder why the things that will make the biggest difference are expensive.

Meditation has to be free or inexpensive.

Yoga has to be free or inexpensive.

Permaculture trainings has to be free or inexpensive.

The only way for the good things to be offered for free is for the giver to live a simpler lifestyle. This will make him less dependent on monetizing what should be free or inexpensive technologies
