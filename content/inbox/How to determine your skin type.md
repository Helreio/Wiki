# How to determine your skin type

Before buying skin care products and implementing the [[Simple skin care routine]], determine your skin type first by doing the following steps:

1. Apply a gentle cleanser (like Celeteque) on your skin by following [[How to use a cleanser]].
2. Do not put anything on your face after for 30 minutes.

Based on what happens to your skin, you can identify your skin type using the following parameters:

- If nothing much happend to your skin, itâ€™s probably normal.
- If you have lots of oil, you have an oily skin.
- If your face is tight and pulling out, you have a dry skin.
- If you have some wet and dry parts in your face, you have a combination type skin.
- If your face turned red, you have a sensitive skin. Sensitivity is not a separate type. It is a characteristic on top of a skin type.
