# PCR non-reliability led to a false pandemic

We develop the figures of the number of cases and deaths caused by Covid, because of the PCR test. If the PCR test is not a reliable test for infection, then all the numbers we have gathered are highly suspicious. These numbers create the picture that we have a pandemic, when we simply do not have one. If there is no true pandemic then there is no true emergency, and there is no reason for the administration of vaccines that are still under trial.
