# Some thoughts on gamifying life

Apply [[Atomic Habits]]:

1. Set a clear goal.
2. Set actionable steps towards that goal.
3. Provide fast feedback.

Life becomes a game because it has the following elements:

1. Goal
2. Rules
3. Steps
4. Rewards

For example, your goal can be your life purpose. The rules of the game are biological rules (e.g. you have a very limited time to live), physical rules (e.g. you can only do things within the bound of physical laws), and societal rules. The steps you take to achieve your within the confines of rules are what makes you creative. You receive rewards if you achieve your goal and it matched your expectations. Rewards can be extrinsic or intrinsic.

In an attempt to create a sense of control, we can create a plan of the steps we take to achieve our goal. But given that life is so antifragile, such a plan needs to be malleable.

Actually, if we should be accurate, it it this telic nature of life that inspired games.

Questions

- Is it possible to create a value-free life manual? One which does not advocate a certain way of living but provides a system or scaffolding where one can construct his own?
