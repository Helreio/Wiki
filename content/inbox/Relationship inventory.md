# Relationship inventory

# *13. Statements I would have like to say*

Write down any significant statements you would have liked to say. What has gone unsaid? If you had your ex in a room for five minutes and he or she could not respond, what would you say? This is your opportunity to say whatever needs to be said that does not fall into numbers 1 to 12.

---

---

# *12. Major issues from my own issues*

Write down any major incidents or issues in the relationship that stemmed from your own issues or your own behavior. Was there something you did that led to a major blowup? Write down anything that you would take back if you could.

---

Moving out of depression, I started to be really immersed in self-development. I have a tendency to shut people down. This is what I did to her. I shut her down and I became complacent. Thinking she won’t leave me anyway, so I can take her for granted.

---

# *11. What I feel I did wrong*

Write down the things you feel you did wrong (not what your ex said you did wrong but what you truly feel you did wrong). Include both things you did and things you didn’t do. Write about everything you can think of—not speaking to your ex, being controlling, being in a bad mood, picking a fight, or bringing up issues that weren’t important.

---

I shut her down. I became less present in the relationship.

I became complacent. I became unconsciously convinced that she will not leave me and there’s no need to nurture the relationship. That I could just focus on my own growth and she will always be there.

I continued on a relationship that I was not 100% into and my ambivalence influenced how I acted in the relationship.

---

# *10. 5 most hurtful incidents*

Write down the five most hurtful incidents to you in the relationship. What was done? What was said? Was there an apology or a reassurance that it would never happen again? Did it happen again? Were there apologies and promises made and not kept?

---

1. The way she handled breaking up with me. She wanted to hide the real reason. She just wants me out of her life without any proper goodbye. She doesn’t want to meet me in person, she feels like she is not obliged to do so. She didn’t clarify things between the two of us before jumping into a new person. She treated me in a way that she never treated me before.

---

# *9. Early warning signs*

Think back to the beginning of the relationship and make a list of all the early warning signs. Did you have an argument early on, or was there some behavior that gave you a clue that this was not going to work out—maybe something that gave you a hint that this person was capable of hurting you deeply? What warning signs were flashing loud and clear? What did you do about it? What did you not do about it? How did you manage to rationalize it to yourself, or did you just ignore it completely? What could you have done about it way back when? Why didn’t you? What compromises or bargains did you make with yourself? What price did you pay for those compromises?

---

1. My first impression when I saw her the first time was that she looked like a prostitute.
2. While she was entertaining me at the first two weeks of me getting to know her, she was also with another guy. I think even when we both came inside a relationships, she was still seeing this guy.
3. She let an Arab guy into her apartment while in Malaysia.
4. She lied and cheated on me about a Malaysian guy.
5. She lied and cheated on me about a guy she met on Tinder.
6. I bet she met more guys other than these.
7. I saw that lying was something she does easily. She lies a lot to her mom.

---

# *8. Positive to negative*

Make a list of all the positive qualities that turned into negative qualities for you over time. For example, maybe you were initially impressed that this person was very neat and clean, but later he or she berated you for your lack of neatness. Perhaps you were drawn to this person because of financial stability and later realized it was actually unreasonable frugality. Perhaps you initially thought this person to be confident and assertive but eventually recognized him or her as controlling and inflexible. Think about things that drew you in, but that you wound up disliking or seeing differently by the end.

---

She was really open about exploring things with me sexually. This was a very positive quality of her in the relationship. But I think, over time, this made her more promiscuous, leading her to attempt cheating on me several times.

---

# *7. Negative qualities of my ex*

Make a list of all of your ex’s negative qualities. Focus on aspects of your ex that you really disliked and wanted to change.

---

She lies.

She cheats.

She is addicted to Facebook and her phone.

She snubs me while browsing her Facebook timeline.

She does not respond with enthusiasm when I talk about something I am enthusiastic about. It seems sometimes that she didn’t really care about what I was talking about.

She finds it so difficult to express herself. So we can’t talk really well.

She have chosen her family and work over me twice. She never regretted it.

She no longer respects me.

Se is not willing to sacrifice for me or the relationship.

She is selfish.

She is so fucked up by work she can't improve herself.

She is always looking for my fault.

We started the wrong way and it has carried over.

We live very different lives.

---

# *6. Negative things about the relationship*

Make a list of all the negative things about the relationship. Again, this is not the negative things about your ex, but the negative things unique to that particular relationship (e.g., you couldn’t go out with your friends when you wanted to, you had to let your ex know when you were home).

---

For a long time, I really felt that I was the only one committed to making the relationship better.

Every time I asked myself whether or not she was the person I am going to marry, the answer was always NO. I always remembered Meagan’s story about Braun and what he felt the very day he married his first wife. He knew he was doing the wrong thing. I always felt this with Precious, particularly when thinking about bringing the relationship to the next level.

I was required to answer the phone whenever she called. Even when I don’t answer, because that is who I am, I felt that my desire for alone time, for creative time, was never fully understood and honored.

My depression was never fully supported in this relationship.

Both of us were in relationship ambivalence from 2016 onwards. That’s more than two years. But even when we were just starting out, I bought a book about relationship ambivalence. And while I was in UP, I was looking for a replacement. I even dated a deaf for one day when I finally came home to Pangasinan.

---

# *5. Things I like but my friends and family did not like*

Make a list of the things you liked about your ex that your friends or family did not like. What kinds of things put you at odds with friends or family? Do you feel your ex was misunderstood, or did you suspect that your family and friends were right? Did you explain or excuse the behavior that others did not like in your ex?

---

---

# *4. Things my friends and family like about my ex*

2. She contacted Dave Ursillo to record a short birthday video for me.

Family-oriented

Funny

Very open to doing things with me sexually

---

# *1. Positive things about the relationship*

Make a list of all the positive things about the relationship. Note that you’re not listing the positive things about your ex (that comes later), but the positive things about that particular relationship (e.g., you liked having a boy/girlfriend, you liked going to your ex’s parents’ house for Sunday dinner, you liked your ex’s friends, you liked going somewhere your ex took you regularly where you had never been before).

---

I liked being with a beautiful woman with me when I’m walking around.

I liked traveling to Bicol to meet her. It was a time for me to totally escape my past life. Going somewhere no one knows me and feeling loved and secured around someone.

I liked having a thriving sex life. We had phone and chat sex almost every day back then.

I liked having someone to talk to over the phone every day, just sharing my day and my life.

I liked thinking about that first anniversary. Crystal helped me and I really appreciate and enjoyed that afternoon. The very day when that surprise happened (or did not happen?) was also awesome. It was the first year of the relationship and the peak of it. We were both still at school and we’ve learned to love each other despite the tumultuous start.

I liked having someone eat out with me.

I felt comfortable with her. Really, really at peace and comfortable.

I liked the feeling of having another family, in Bicol, a family that is more tight-knit than mine.

I liked how Kuya Carlo treated me.

I liked having someone visit me where I live, Baguio or in Pangasinan, just to be with me.

I liked having a girl live with me in Manila, try building a small family, managing the house and all. Buying home essentials with her was something I really enjoyed.

I liked receiving letters, gifts, anything she created with effort.

I liked eating at Maginhawa with her.

I liked eating at UP with her.

I liked visiting bookstores with her.

I liked watching movies with her.

I liked traveling with her.

I liked sharing my sexual fantasies with her.

I liked sharing what I was learning from myself, my studies, and experiences with her.
