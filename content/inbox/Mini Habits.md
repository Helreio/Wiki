# Mini Habits

# Step 1 - Choose Your Mini Habits & Habit Plan

Habit Plan

Multiple Mini Plan

Aim for 100% success (not 95%).

Aspire for the feeling of total success, which is important for maintaining high self-efficacy.

Do 3 mini habits. Do 4 at your own risk.

Full-sized habits to pursue

Make your habit small.

Make your concept of “success” small too: you must embrace this mini-requirement as if it is a full goal.

“If you're using the no cue strategy, then you can either seek rewards after you take action or stay conscious of how you feel and reward yourself when you think you need it.”

“Mini habits offer the perk of a greater sense of satisfaction than traditional habits (i.e. a greater secondary reward!). If you think a great accomplishment feels good, know that it feels even better when you did 95% of it as bonus work. Though when you do a lot of bonus work, you might want to reward yourself to encourage that behavior.”

“My rule of thumb is to keep myself happy while doing this. I know when I'm nearing burnout, and that’s when I'll take a rewarding break.”

# Step 5 - Write Everything Down

Check off your success before you got to sleep.

“Physically making a check mark makes your success feel more tangible than digital tracking does. Additionally, if you put it in a prominent place where you'll see it often, it's going to make you mindful of your mini habits, your progress, and your success. Don't underestimate the impact of this!”

“Regardless of how you track your mini habits completion, I suggest you at least handwrite the habits themselves in a place you can see.”

# Step 6 - Think Small

Strengthen our willpower. - Make it last whole day.

Make progress in the present moment. - Bonus Reps + Safety Net.

Not exhaust our willpower.

# Step 7 - Meet Your Schedule & Drop High Expectations

Remind yourself that even if you exceed your MINI HABIT, your MINI HABIT is still SUCCESS.

Refuse bigger target. You can do more with smaller ones.
