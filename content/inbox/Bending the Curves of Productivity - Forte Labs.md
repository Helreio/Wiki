Bending the Curves of Productivity - Forte Labs

“the flow curve dips below the time/money curve at the beginning. This is why **setting aside a big block of time feels risky. If you’re going to spend that much time, you’d better have something to show for it.** ”

“Essentially, your goal in the beginning of the session is to use your high energy to overcome the “struggle” stage. You’re hoping to leap onto and climb the cliff of flow before your energy drops too low or time runs out”

“virtually all the value in the typical individual working session is created at the very end”

“The goal of any employee’s working session, from your employer’s point of view, is for the value curve to intersect the time_money curve. If it doesn’t, you’ve spent more time and your company has spent more money than the value that was created. _**_If value created exceeds time_money, that is what’s known as a “very productive day.** ””

“Every major “school” of productivity thought can be defined in terms of which curve it attempts to bend, and how.”

“The “Energy School” offers a variety of ways to get that energy curve higher.”

“If you can just keep your energy level high enough, their argument goes, your productivity will be great.”

“The “Focus School” is all about getting into and staying in flow.”

“They argue that the best strategy is to pick a task and then hammer away at it until it’s finished, extending that flow curve as long as possible.”

“The “Efficiency School” is obsessed with the logistics of work.”

“Breaking our day into smaller segments has no effect on the time/money spent. You’re paid a fixed amount to be there a certain number of hours, regardless of how they’re divided up.

And there isn’t much effect on the energy curve either. You’re still tired at the end of the day, no matter how many or few sessions you’ve had.

The real impact of breaking up our day into smaller segments is on flow, or the lack thereof:”

“Since we don’t have enough time in one stretch to get into flow, we spend most of our day in struggle. We feel as if we’re interrupted from the current interruption by yet another interruption. This is how you can work hard all day, yet walk away with the distinct impression you didn’t get anything done.”

“what if this new workplace environment we find ourselves in is actually a good thing? What if we saw the constant stimulation not as interruptions and distractions, but as opportunities for rich feedback and connection? What if we used online networks as platforms for learning and collaboration, not as procrastination devices?”

“In other words, instead of fighting the direction the world is moving — drinking more coffee, cutting off our access to technology, and trying to force ourselves to focus — wouldn’t it be easier to flow with it? Or possibly even use it to our advantage?”

“Value School. Its objective will be to shift the curve that usually gets taken for granted: the “value created” curve.”

“What we need to do is change the shape and size of the value curve to match the pace at which modern work moves. **Instead of delivering value in a big package that spans huge amounts of time and money, we deliver it in smaller chunks at more frequent intervals**:”

“small batch sizes, a key part of the Just-In-Time vision that has propelled Toyota through 7 decades of growth to become the world’s largest automaker.”

“ **delivering value quickly in small chunks is essential for learning and innovation**.”

“If each worker in this new economy really is a Company of One, wouldn’t it make sense for us to use the same approach that has revolutionized manufacturing, software development, and startups?”

“What is the information age equivalent to the raw materials that flow through a factory?”

“But tasks are not inventory — they are nothing but abstract units of organization.”

“ **The inventory of knowledge work is ideas. What you are selling, as a “worker of knowledge,” are the ideas you’ve “processed” through the focused application of your attention.** ”

“ **If ideas are the inventory of knowledge work, then reducing our batch sizes requires changing not how we manage tasks and projects, but how we manage the information content of those projects.** ”

“ **We need to change our conception of what we are producing, from final deliverables to what I will call “intermediate packets.” Instead of seeing the final product (the deliverable we sell to the client) as the only repository of value, we package up all the intermediate steps — the research, notes, brainstorms, examples, outlines, prototypes, drafts, and even crazy ideas we choose not to pursue — as reusable components for later consumption.** ”

“At the end of the project, instead of making one final crazy all-night push to load every single part of the project into our brain for final delivery, our task is much easier: final assembly of the previously built packets.”

“1. Create value in any span of time”

“If we see our work as creating these intermediate packets, we can find ways to create value in any span of time, no matter how short. Productivity becomes a game of matching each available block of time with a corresponding packet of value.”

“2. Less intimidating”

“redefine our work in smaller units that give us this feeling of completion at a more consistent pace”

“ **if your only goal is to create an intermediate packet and show it to someone — good notes on a book, a Pinterest board of design inspirations, just one module of code — then you can trick yourself into getting started. And even if that particular Big Project doesn’t pan out, you’ll still have the value of the packets at your disposal.** ”

“3. Become interruption-proof”

“You can even start to see interruptions as a good thing: they remind you not to take on too much at once, to check in with others, to clear your mind and take a break once in awhile.”

“Because you rarely even try to load the entire project into your mind at once, there isn’t much to lose if someone taps you on the shoulder.”

“4. Better feedback”

“you can stop more often to get feedback.”

“Part of the packaging of an intermediate chunk is that it becomes legible — others can get a sense of what it is and what it means”

“people are more willing to give honest feedback on something that is merely work-in-process, whereas they’re hesitant to critique something that looks highly polished.”

“5. Productivity flywheel”

“After you’ve been working this way for awhile, there is a final benefit: you gain the ability to complete entire projects merely by assembling previously created packets. There seems to be a critical mass in a given industry or area — once you reach that mass, each additional packet added creates exponential value in the connections it creates with others.”

“This is the mythical productivity flywheel — a system that produces value almost on its own, while you take a back seat as curator, manager, and gatekeeper.”

“It requires us to get much, much better at packaging our work mid-stream.”

“we can’t afford to do this packaging during the project, because every spare moment is needed to race toward the deadline. And we can’t do it after the project ends, because by then we’re already off to the next one.”

“ **this packaging has to be embedded into the actual way we work moment to moment, so that it doesn’t take any extra time whatsoever**.”

“they optimize for productive randomness”

“Each person possesses a unique lifestream of information from numerous sources, and success increasingly depends on curating, tweaking, redirecting, and capturing value from this stream to use in our work. Instead of hiding our insights and learnings in neatly labeled folders and files, we want to expose them as intermediate packets of ever-evolving, intermediate work.”

“Note-taking apps, simply put, are our best option for “bending” productivity to the ebb and flow of our days, and for managing the work-in-process inventory of ideas that represents our main asset as knowledge workers.”
