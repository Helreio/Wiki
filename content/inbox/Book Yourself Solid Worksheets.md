**Instances I’ve felt alive living out my true colours**

**How I might change my behaviour or communication to stop compromising myself**

**Instances I’ve sold out or settled for less**

I can’t think of instances. The best experiences I had was being with myself, doing what I was passionate about with complete freedom.

I should accept where I am.

I should tell the story I want to live.

I should live the story I want to tell.

I should never settle for the worse when accepting clients.

I will choose my mentors wisely.

I will choose my friends wisely and surround myself with the right people.

I will get clarity on who I am and what I do.

I will practice telling people boldly about who I am and what I do.

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056858,120.453699)

I want to help light workers align their lives with nature and the universe through the work they do, the service they provide, and within their inner lives.

**Why I do what I do for the people I serve**

Freedom drives me.

The freedom to do what I want to do when I want to do it.

The freedom to be who I really am.

I guess working for myself would eventually lead to more time for a life that goes with the flow.

Creativity drives.

I hunger it.

It’s cathartic.

It heals me.

It brings joy, colour, adventure in my everyday life.

I want to be connected.

Connected with the people who think the same way, who feel the same way, who want an amazing life filled with authentic self-expression and conscious service.

I want to contribute to the larger healing of the world.

I want to help my tribe live lives that are more aligned to the reality behind the universe, to be more aligned with human nature, to be more aligned with the fundamental spiritual truths - that we are One and not separate, that the divine resides in the ordinary.

**My vision for what I hope to achieve through my work**

What I want to achieve in my work is an extension of what I want to achieve in life.

# Written Exercise 4A - 5 Part Book Yourself Solid Dialogue Formula

I help spiritually-minded, service-oriented and highly creative individuals live more consciously, find their greatest contribution, tap into their most creative and divine selves, and ultimately pursue a career that heals the world.

**Their three biggest urgent needs are:**

1. SOUL WORK: Getting clarity on their message and defining their next steps.
2. PRACTICAL WORK: Supporting themselves financially and managing their finances while pursuing their vocation.
3. TECHNICAL WORK: Working on the nuts and bolts of their creative projects.

**My clients' compelling desires are:**

1. FREEDOM: To build a career or business that hopefully will bring them a measure of freedom.
2. HOLISTIC WORK: To build a career or business that suits their health needs.
3. CREATIVITY: To build a career or business that they will be able to enhance their creativity every step of the way.
4. AUTHENTICITY: To be known with a brand that is authentic.
5. SERVICE: To serve others and to make a difference through the work they are doing.

**So I help them with those things by:**

1. TEACHING - Online courses and in-person workshops.
2. COACHING - One on one focus work on their specific situations.
3. WRITING - Informative and educational blog posts; and freelance writing services.

I’d say the number one result they experience when they work with me is MOVEMENT. Movement that is healthy, gentle, friendly, and sustainable. One they can continue to follow by themselves because they’ll feel that their goals are achievable.

**What’s more, they experience some deeper core benefits like...**

**Financial Benefits**

Content drive traffic to my clients’ blogs which means if they have a monetisation plan in place that’s money for them.

An ebook I create and launch for them will obviously make them money.

A beautiful website designed for the right audience will create more businesses for them.

Coaching them from the beginning until the end of launching their platform will result in a project that will earn them in the future recurrently.

**Emotional Benefits**

I emphasise simplicity in working with people so that removes a lot of stress.

I make them feel that their content is taken cared of by a seasoned and competent writer.

They are well-treated.

I make them feel like rockstars!

**Physical Benefits**

Holistically healthier overall.

**Spiritual Benefits**

They are connected to their purpose.

They are connected with their “True Self."

They are in alignment with what they believe.

They do work that gives them a measure of freedom.

They do work that is healthy for them.

They do work that allows them to explore their creativity.

Their work has a positive impact on others.

**THE MEDIUM VERSION**

I help light workers live more consciously, find their greatest contribution, tap into their most creative and divine selves, and ultimately pursue a career that heals the world.

What’s a light worker?

A light worker is someone who is spiritually-minded, service-oriented and highly creative. She is naturally geared towards helping others. Her life’s work contributes to healing our ailing world. She serves but she does so in a way that is authentic to her true self and is nourishing to her soul.

For a light worker to live his vocation, he needs three things:

- A way to sustain himself financially so he can continue his work.
- A way to continuously nurture himself and replenish his soul so he can continue helping others.
- A message, a service, any form of contribution and a way to bring that contribution to whom it is meant for.

My life’s work is to help fulfil these needs for the light worker.

Through inspiring and informative blog posts, actionable books, educational courses, and intimately focused one-on-one coaching, I help light workers move with their missions.

I want you to feel freedom - freedom to do the work you were meant to do without struggling with money.

I want you to feel inner peace while you do your work. I want my processes to help you remove the overwhelm while pursuing your work so you can enjoy the journey.

I want you to feel connected to your purpose, connected to your true self, in alignment with what you believe in.

I want you to feel vibrant and creative, every day.

I want you to feel good serving other, serving the world.
