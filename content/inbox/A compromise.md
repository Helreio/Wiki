# A compromise

Reasons

1. Governments have been tryannical in approaching the rollout of vaccines and their general approach in addressing the pandemic. I am still pro choice and autonomy. People who want the vaccine should be allowed to have it. People who don’t want it should be allowed not to have it. Policies should never discriminate against either.
2. Contrary to what most advocates against the vaccine say, the latest versions of the vaccines are generally safe. Waiting this long before getting vaccinated was a wise decision as it gave more time to correct possible mistakes.
3. A compromise might be needed to avoid massive reduction of quality of life right now. By not taking the vaccine, I might be protecting myself from future complications, but massively affecting my mental health at the present moment because I cannot see my family, travel, etc. Remember, the present moment is what is true—to be with family, to do what matters, to be happy now, these are more important than being alive or healthy in the future. We are all gonna be dead sooner rather than later. That is inevitable. But the present moment—that is what we can control. That is what is truly precious. As an individual, who is powerless and does not desire to rub against the state, I need to weigh my priorities: Is there a way for me to make a compromise so I keep my liberties and raise my quality of life NOW, while protecting myself for possible adverse reactions from the vaccine? If there is a way, why wouldn’t I take that route?

Compromise

1. Schedule for vaccination.
2. Take 2 doses of ivermectin every day for 5 days before vaccination.
3. Get first dose of the Moderna vaccine.
4. Take 2 doses of ivermectin every day for 5 days after vaccination.
5. Take 2 doses of ivermectin every day for 5 days before vaccination.
6. Get second dose of the Moderna vaccine.
7. Take 2 doses of ivermectin every day for 5 days after vaccination.
8. Whenever asked, continue to raise awareness about the tyranny of science and the government regarding this issue.
