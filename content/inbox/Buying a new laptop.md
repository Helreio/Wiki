# Buying a new laptop

Goals

- Try Linux
- Still use mac os
- Able to use

If I buy a new mac, I will be able to continue using it with new software for a few more years. The problem is

1. Experiment installing linux on macbook using parallels
2. Explore linux as a side project
3. If linux doesn't work for you then stick to apple.
