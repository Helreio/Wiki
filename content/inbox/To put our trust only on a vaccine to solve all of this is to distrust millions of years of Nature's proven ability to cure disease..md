To put our trust only on a vaccine to solve all of this is to distrust millions of years of Nature's proven ability to cure disease. There are existing cases wherein existing substances - both natural and synthetic (which are, of course, still taken from Nature) - are already showing signs of curative effects on COVID. But the mainstream health system - with its heirarchical, rigid structure infested with political and money-making motivations - will not allow these existing cures to reach mainstream use. The result: unending lockdowns and recessions worldwide that are already causing more deaths than the virus itself.
