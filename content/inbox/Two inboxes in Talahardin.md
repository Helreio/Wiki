# Two inboxes in Talahardin

There seems to be two inboxes:

1. The big writing inbox
2. The specific project inbox (see if you can incorporate discussions from Thyla Thwarp here)

A rule I am thinking about implementing is this: When you have projects, prioritize processing project inboxes over the randomness of the big writing inbox. If projects are available, prioritize them.
