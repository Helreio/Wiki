# *Painless Blogging [Lesson 1]*

**Subject:** Painless Blogging [Lesson 1]

**From:** Vincent Imbat

**To:** Keith lawrence Cruz

**Date received:** April 3, 2015

Hi Keith,

As I said a while ago, we'll just do this one on one. I think this is good because we can really focus on building your blog according to your specific needs.

So let's start shall we?

I want to begin with the four tenets of our process.

**Tenets**

1. We want to nail the main theme of your blog.
2. We want to amplify that theme to reach the right audience.
3. We want you to be able to establish a sustainable blogging habit.
4. We want to do all of these "painlessly."

To apply these tenets, here are some guidelines which I really suggest you do:

**Guidelines**

*1. Refrain from searching the web for advice.*

Reason:

You might be overwhelmed and this removes the "painlessness" of our process. Blogging is an over-saturated topic in the Internet and I have experienced this personally that is why I advice you to focus on the steps outlined in our process instead of looking for other better ways. You will have ample time to read more about the subjects that we will cover AFTER executing the essential steps towards building a blog

*2. Don't rush. Look at this as a long-term project.*

Reason:

Pain starts when we want to be where we will be ten years from now. When we live in the future (or the past), we create unnecessary self-inflicted suffering that is really detrimental to the accomplishment of the very thing we want to do.

So let's not rush this. Instead, let's do this step-by-step, appreciating our progress and even celebrating our little wins.

I hope that you look at writing as something you'll do for the long-term, a craft which you will hone and develop. Even if you fail to accomplish all your other goals for the blog, rest assured that expressing yourself through an on-line platform is a beneficial advantage for whatever you decide to do in the future.

*3. Focus on establishing the habit of writing and don't hope to do all of this perfectly THIS TIME.*

Reason:

Our goal while you are still beginning is to establish the foundation of a sustainable blogging lifestyle. So we focus on establishing healthy blogging habits and setting up our platform rather than optimizing or achieving perfection in what we do.

Just treat your first few months as a passion activity. Practice FOR NOW. Once you get the hang of it, then we optimize.

Are we good?

**Our Process**

Ideally, I want to be able to communicate with you via Skype/call so I can guide you easily, but I am going back to Manila tomorrow in the next few days. Anyway, we still have later and tomorrow pa naman (siguro), so if you think you need me to guide you on demand then we can set a schedule.

If this won't be possible, then feel free to text me so I can respond to your queries immediately.

**LET'S START**

Create a separate label or folder for all our lessons Keith, so you can reference them in the future.

On my next e-mail, which I will be sending to you in a while, I will send your first activity.

1. My main reason in starting a blog is just to document all the memorable things I experienced (or will experience) and share it to the world with the hope of inspiring other people/changing their lives through my experiences. (JUST THE FIRST THOUGHT THAT COMES TO MY MIND).
2. Aside from the one above, I want to blog just for the sake of blogging. I just think it is fun and awesome having a platform where I can express myself. Do whatever I want to do.

Also, I want to monetize my blog in the future.

On Saturday, April 4, 2015 7:19 PM, Vincent Imbat [vincent.imbat@gmail.com wrote:    ON SETTING THE RIGHT OBJECTIVESHi there again Keith,Thank you for your answers.I started with objectives because your choice of objective actually determines the kind of problems you will be encountering in the next few months blogging.There are 3 common objectives in blogging.1. To express yourself and enjoy the practice of blogging itself.2. To expand your influence.3. To earn income.On Blogging for FulfillmentIf you go with the first objective, then you don't really have to learn the hard stuff or the SCIENCE of blogging (web design, copywriting and marketing).Since your goal is simply to express yourself then by all means do so freely. This is doing blogging as ART.Choosing this as your primary objective means that you should expect that influence and income won't come easily.On Blogging for InfluenceOn the other hand, if you choose influence as your primary objective, your desire to deliver a message, champion a world-view or establish a brand is more important than the joy of blogging or the money that you can get from it.To expand your influence, you have to learn some marketing and copywriting strategies to improve your reach but this won't be as hardcore as what you should do when your primary purpose is earning money online.On Blogging for MoneyWhen money is your primary purpose, don't expect blogging to be easy. It will be hard and actually if you want to be rich, blogging should not be your first option. There are easier ways to earn money than blogging.Earning revenue from blogging should definitely be a goal of yours but start from small goals like:"This year, I will earn enough money from blogging to be able to make my blog self-sufficient."To earn money that you can use to pay for web hosting and domain name renewal for your first year of blogging is already a big achievement.What Now?I suggest that you set all of these as your objectives for blogging.Blog for the joy of it, for the attention you'll get and for the revenue from it.But here's the key:Set what your PRIMARY objective is and learn to prioritize it from the others.A good strategy is this:For the first few months of blogging, prioritize ENJOYMENT of the process and establishing the habit of writing at least 1 blog post per week (although 2-3 will be good if you are just starting).Once you feel that you already enjoy the process of writing and publishing your work, move on to your next objective: INFLUENCE.This will involve establishing relationships with your readers and with other bloggers. This will also require you to learn Search Engine Optimization, copywriting and basic website design to enhance probability of reaching more people.Then after that, you might consider how to monetize the blog.Actually, while you are busy fulfilling the first two objectives of blogging, you can already establish the foundations of monetizing your blog. But do so minimally. Focus on establishing good productivity habits and relationships with your readers.That is it for the third lesson.If you have any questions, hit reply and ask me](mailto:vincent.imbat@gmail.com)

[. Otherwise, let's move on to the next lesson.   Re: Painless Blogging ❲Lesson 4❳Subject: Re: Painless Blogging ❲Lesson 4❳From: Keith lawrence Cruz To: Vincent Imbat Date received: April 5, 2015Hello Vince!I will start with a personal blog since I primarily want a blog as a form of expression and to influence other people. Also, I think it is a good starting point for a beginner like me. Nonetheless, I want to learn how to monetize my blog afterwards. But I am in no rush, so I guess a personal blog would fit my personality. I think a personal blog is easier to be configured as a hybrid later on. I also have that intention. I just want to see where this venture will take me later on. I am getting excited to be honest. :)](http://about.me/klcruz?promo=email_sig)

I didn't talk about technical stuff yet because I want you to have a clear background about the reality of blogging.Today, you have make a decision about something that will define the next steps that you would take.Please visit this link and read this short article by Jeff Goins.http://goinswriter.com/blog-types/](mailto:vincent.imbat@gmail.com)

After reading, you have to make a decision whether your blog will PRIMARILY be a personal or a topical blog.

**ON CHOOSING A PERSONAL BLOG**

In case you choose a personal blog, I would suggest you register a domain name which is your own name, like:

[keithcruz.com](http://keithcruz.com/)

or something like that.

Choosing personal blogging also means that your primary objectives should either be blogging for fulfillment or blogging for influence. As Jeff's article says, a personal blog may be harder to monetize but definitely not impossible. It will just take a little while.

**ON CHOOSING A TOPICAL BLOG**

On the other hand, if you decide to pursue a topical blog, it's good to make influence or money your primary objectives. Of course you could still enjoy blogging but your freedom will be quite limited because you have to put your readers first before yourself. You also have to learn copywriting and some website optimization to achieve your goals.

**A HYBRID BLOG**

As Jeff said, you can create a hybrid blog but it is good to know the primary nature of your blog.

An example of a hybrid blog is [chrisguillebeau.com](http://chrisguillebeau.com/)

The domain name of that blog is the name of the author, but the title of the blog is The Art of Non-Conformity and it talks about non-conventional strategies in work, travel and life. Although the blog's topic sprout from the own experiences of the author, it later on evolve to be more about the topic rather than the author and because of that, the blog became very popular.

**YOUR DECISION**

Don't worry too much about this decision. Just rely on your gut feel and do what makes more sense at this time in your life. Remember, this is just your first blog. You can always start a new one later.

Please respond to this email with your decision.

Personal or topical?

Feel free to ask questions also.

**Subject:** Re: Painless Blogging [Lesson 5]

**From:** Keith lawrence Cruz

**To:** Vincent Imbat

**Date received:** April 6, 2015

The topics, I feel enthusiastic to write about are:

- How to live a well-spent life; a life full of blissful moments. A kind of life which, when it is time for you to rest eternally, will make you smile while saying: "It was one hell of a ride! Definitely a life well wasted."
- How to live as an introvert in a world dominated by extroverts - in terms of travel (an introverted traveler. "An Introvert's Travelogue" Yay!), in the workplace, in everyday living.
- Life of an islander: Contemplation while in the island.
- "Tales from the Toilet Bowl: And other shitty tales full of crap" - this is an interesting idea I came up with back in college. I just noticed that I often think deeply why making a crap, as in existential and life thoughts, really deep thoughts. Hahaha! I think I am witty with this one. I really wanted to make a book entitled as such.
- Living an unconventional and minimalist lifestyle in a developing country-setting. As in I wanted to take on a journey to live a life of essentialism pushing myself to the limits and sharing my experience in my blog.
- Also, I want to do a personal blog on my journey towards completing my bucket list/goals. (I really like this idea) I think it would have a different touch from other similar blogs since I am from the Philippines with much limited resources than most of them. (I think I want to stick with this one, I will make my bucketlist! Hahaha!)
- I am really sold with the last one. I cannot think of something better.
- I just though of something better. A photo blog of people from the Philippines, (like a Humans of New York-type)
- That is it I guess.

Of course, you won't be writing about everything unless you know, well, everything.Since you chose to write a personal blog to start your journey, I presume that you will be writing subjects springing from your own life, thoughts and experiences. Nevertheless, personal blogs are so flexible so you may have more topic ideas.So let's start this lesson by making a list of all those ideas in your head. Write them all down until you no longer have anything to say.To help you with this brainstorming activity, answer the question:What topics do you feel ENTHUSIASTIC about writing on your blog?❲Write: Feel free to write anything in any form.

It gave me many realizations. For one, I did not consider filtering my target audience. Heh!Anyway, this Vince is my ideal reader:A fellow introvert (or someone who is interested in introversion).Somebody who is a humanist (someone who value human agency, our capacity and power to make genuine change in our society and in our selves).Somebody who is an existentialist (someone who is in constant search for life's meaning, who is in a constant struggle to find meaning for himself/herself).Someone who is forward-looking. I want to talk to people who have big dreams for their future.Nonetheless, I want someone who knows the value of the present moment, or is open in knowing that value.Someone who is vulnerable, exposed. Someone who interacts as genuinely as possible, showing/exposing his/her vulnerability, his strengths, her weaknesses.Somebody who is creative, open to adventures, and has positivity even though experiencing life's daily struggle.Lastly, I want to have genuine conversation with people who can bring intellectual and creative discourse to any topic. As long as there is an interaction and exchange of knowledge and perspectives, that is enough.These, Vince, are my ideal readers. Also, as I was writing the qualities above, I just felt burdened. I don't think I have the certain capacity to lead or converse with such readership. It is like I am one with them and not above them, how would I be able to give advice to them if this is the case?

You were able to identify the topics you are interested in blogging about.3. You were able to identify your main objectives.Now let's talk a little bit about readership.BRANDING A BLOG WITH MANY TOPICSI took the topics you sent to me before and summarised them in a few words:LivingIntroversion + TravelIsland LivingToilet Bowl RealizationsUnconventional LivingMinimalismEssentialism*Everything embellished with local Filipino flavor.Now, here's your next assignment.DEFINE YOUR IDEAL READERSEven if your blog is a personal blog, you want to create something that TOUCHES the lives of others and the truth is that a blog like any other communication tool is a platform that enhances just that: COMMUNICATION. And no communication is one way. It is always a two way process. That means that you have to think about what your readers want to read and try to strike a balance between the topics you want to write about and what people want to read. This will especially be important when you decide to build a business around your blog. A business is primarily a service where people (customers) come first in the process.That is why even if you want to write about personal matters, you want to be sure that people can actually RELATE to what you are talking about.Now, how to we define our "ideal" readers?Rule: Write for the people you actually love to be around with.That means, these people actually GET you and therefore GET and even LOVE the things you are talking about.Please read the article on this link:http://blog.getsatisfaction.com/2010/10/21/red-velvet-rope-policy/](mailto:vincent.imbat@gmail.com)

On Wednesday, April 22, 2015 3:26 PM, Vincent Imbat [vincent.imbat@gmail.com wrote:    Keith,Thank you for responding to my email last time.It's good that now you have at least an idea about the qualities of your ideal reader. That exercise is enough for now. I don't want to burden you with so many thoughts about your reader. As I said before, this is the only ESSENTIAL truth you should always remember:THE READER IS ALWAYS A PART OF THE EQUATIONSo before you write anything, before you build your blog, you should always think about the people you will be SERVING.Of course, you should balance this with how you cope with ENDURANCE.There are two main problems in blogging that you will definitely encounter:1. Writing about something you will give up very fast.2. Writing something that no one wants to read.The secret is building a blog that:1. You feel ENTHUSIASTIC about and;2. A good number of people feel ENTHUSIASTIC about too.About Your QueryI quote what you were asking at your latest email so you can remember. You said:"Also, as I was writing the qualities above, I just felt burdened. I don't think I have the certain capacity to lead or converse with such readership. It is like I am one with them and not above them, how would I be able to give advice to them if this is the case? Do you get me?"The core of your question is your statement which is:"It is like I am one with them and not above them, how would I be able to give advice to them if this is the case?"Cool question buddy. Good thing you asked. That is a question of expertise. You feel what most bloggers (in fact all of them and their creative cousins) feel most of the time. The feeling that you are not an AUTHORITY.The quick answer:DON'T BE AN EXPERT.Expertise takes years to build. You can't start as an expert. BUT YOU DO HAVE SOMETHING IN YOU THAT YOU COULD USE TO START.Start there.Most beginners tend to "fake it til they make it." They project an image that they know everything about a topic and that they are an authority even if deep inside they are not.This is dangerous, both for your readers and for your own self-esteem.So I suggest that you be open about you CURRENT status.There are 2 techniques that you could employ to do this:1. Be a LEADING LEARNER.2. Be a CURATOR/FACILITATOR.LEADING LEARNERA leading learner is someone who admits that he doesn't know everything about the topic but is willing to work hard to research and study the best resources and write them in a palatable manner for his audience. He is a learner, and yet people listen to him, because he is an avid, passionate and even voracious learner. He leads.An example of this is James Clear.Take a look at what he says at the front page of his site: http://jamesclear.com](mailto:vincent.imbat@gmail.com)

That is how you position yourself as a leading learner.

**CURATOR/FACILITATOR**

A curator is someone who does not necessarily create but focuses more on the arrangement, presentation, or synthesis of things (art, ideas, or artifact). In the blogging world (blogosphere), this is someone who:

- [ ] Interviews other people about his topic (see: [unmistakablecreative.com](http://unmistakablecreative.com/) )
- [ ] Researches books and other resources and synthesizes them (see: [brainpickings.com](http://brainpickings.com/) )

You can combine both frameworks if you want. Or you can combine them with a different kind of expert called SURVIVOR EXPERT.

**SURVIVOR EXPERT**

A survivor expert is someone who knows what he is talking about because he went through the same thing and he emerged victorious. A blogger who writes about his journey towards recovery from depression is an example of this.

You can combine all and position yourself as a non-expert but someone who has a measure of authority. Then begin building your expertise as time passes by.

That is it for now.

I'll send another email for our next lesson which I will connect with your other question about your topic.

That is it for now my friend.

Life is good.

Your friend,

Vince

**To:** Vincent Imbat

**Date received:** April 23, 2015

Hello Vince,

I am inclined on the third theme, the unique message theme.

However, before fully committing to it, can you please give me a more deeper explanation.

When you said that "this involves introspection and constant reiteration throughout your blog" what do you mean?

Thank you.

![_______colorbar.png](Painless%20Blogging%20Course.assets/_______colorbar.png)

On Thursday, April 23, 2015 1:33 PM, Vincent Imbat [vincent.imbat@gmail.com wrote:    You were asking for my honest opinion on the bucket list theme you want to pursue.Here's my answer:Hell yeah!!!Do you feel "alive" with this topic? Will this motivate you to live and to write about your life?Then go!I believe that is a perfect way to start. You are launching a "personal blog" anyway. Monetization is not a priority, at least for now. Look at this project as a tool to do that bucket list, to keep you accountable with your goals, and to practice writing.That is something I myself want to implement on my blog in the coming months.Nevertheless, you have to connect this rather "selfish" topic with the desires of your "ideal audience."To do this, I give you our next lesson.ON NAILING YOUR MAIN THEMEBeing a renaissance man, we don't want to get bored with just one topic. In fact, that email you sent me listing all the topics you want to write about is a proof to this. That is true with me too when I was just starting.This is good. But also bad.It can be a bit confusing for your readers. They won't be able to understand what you really are talking about. And in the long run, you might run out of things to write about because you don't know what you really have to write about.How will you strike a balance between your desire to explore many topics and to kill the boredom of writing about the same thing over and over again and the need of your audience to understand you?PICK ONE OF THE THREEFind a problem you passionately want to solve.Find a world-view you can passionately champion (Note: This involves joining a fight against something you abhor)Craft your own unique message that you know you can passionately spread to the world (this involves introspection and constant reiteration throughout your blog). MONETIZATION IMPLICATIONSThe first option will be easier to monetize especially if the problem you are solving is practical. The second and third options should first strive for attention. Instead of money, attention is the currency of these strategies. We can monetize these strategies in the future but the truth is putting out a message out there that makes a change should already be considered a big achievement in a world filled with a million competing messages.HOW TO APPLY THESE TO YOUR TOPICThis is what you told me when you referred on your "bucket list" theme."Also, I want to do a personal blog on my journey towards completing my bucket list/goals. (I really like this idea) I think it would have a different touch from other similar blogs since I am from the Philippines with much limited resources than most of them. (I think I want to stick with this one, I will make my bucketlist! Hahaha!)"How could you use the three strategies on this topic?Here are my ideas (but you don't have to believe them. hehe)Problem ThemeHow to pursue a bucket list in a country with limited resources (a term you might want to use is "bootstrapping").World View ThemeChallenging the conventionally meaningless lifestyle by setting adventurous goals and pursuing them despite limited resources in a Third World setting.Unique Message Theme"Live a well-spent life. No matter what."YOUR ASSIGNMENTI know you have better ideas, so for your assignment:Choose among the three thematic strategies you feel resonance with.Think about the final theme (ideally one simple sentence only) of your blog.:) I'm excited for your answers.

Pero kasi parang yoong activity that the first article asked me to do ay nagawa ko na during our previous lessons.

As promised, here is your lesson for today.By now, you know that you want to build a personal blog around the core topic of "accomplishing your bucket list."The next move to take from here is to ask yourself, how will others relate to your topic? (Especially that it is a very personal one)As I proposed before, you have to think how you will connect your main topic to any of the three:A problemA world-viewA unique messageTo help you understand the importance of connecting your topic to a concept that your audience will "resonate" with, I'll give you some examples. Below are sites with their topic and their "core message." I'll only be providing three, one each for the three types.Fizzle.co](mailto:vincent.imbat@gmail.com)

A problem-centered site

Topic: Launching, maintaining and scaling online businesses

Message: Persevere as an online entrepreneur with high quality training and a community that supports you.

[Chrisguillebeau.com](http://chrisguillebeau.com/)

A world-view site

Topic: Unconventional strategies in work, travel and life

Message: Reject conventional thinking on work, travel and life

[Daveursillo.com](http://daveursillo.com/)

A unique message site

Topic: Writing and spirituality

Message: Be unapologetically you.

I hope you get the idea.

It's not enough that you have a topic (or topics), you have to have a message that people can resonate with. So the question you have to answer is:

"What message can you derive from your topic which you can teach your readers?"

You need introspection to understand this. Honestly, me myself, I haven't come up with a concrete message yet with my own site. That is why, I am doing the same introspection right now. But this is necessary to differentiate you from other bloggers and to guide your writing.

Since you seem to resonate with the third option, here are some articles you might want to study.

[http://goinswriter.com/blog-focus/](http://goinswriter.com/blog-focus/)

[http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/05/16/get-obsessed-with-your-message/](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/05/16/get-obsessed-with-your-message/)

A world-view blog is somewhat related to a unique message blog only that a world-view blog tends to attract more readers but also more haters because of its divisive tendencies.

Even if you don't plan to go through this path, you can still learn something from world-view blogs and how they are built and maybe you can bring some of the techniques from these blogs to arrive on a unique message for your own blog. Here is an article that might help you:

[http://fizzle.co/sparkline/find-your-niche-is-bad-advice](http://fizzle.co/sparkline/find-your-niche-is-bad-advice)

DON'T MAKE THIS PART TOO HARD

My goal is once you get an idea of your core message no matter how bleak it is, I want you to start blogging already. Maybe next week, you can reserve your domain name and I'll teach you the technicals.

So don't spend a lot of time here. Just use your gut feel.

Your blog will evolve as you evolve as a person. Just start with what makes sense right now. Don't worry, I'll teach you how to change focus in the future if you ever feel like you want to change focus. Just nail that message and start writing about it.

ASSIGNMENT

After reading the articles, tell me what you think about them and respond with the core message that you want to deliver in your blog.

Enjoy the process Keith.

This is exciting :)

Vince

**Unique-Message Site**

**Topic: Completing my own bucketlist**

**Core Message: Live your life towards your own happiness**

As you said, the core message needed a lot of introspection. Nonetheless, the article are helpful. Especially for me to be able to gain clarity in my core message. Pero kasi parang yoong activity that the first article asked me to do ay nagawa ko na during our previous lessons. For the second article, I especially like the idea of the "voice" my own voice, my own style. Also, I think I can make use of the concept of cross-pollination. (E.g. bucketlist about traveling, health, self-development etc.)

I am excited to start Vince. Hopefully, I am doing this right.

Thank you very much!

Warmest regards,

Keith

As promised, here is your lesson for today.By now, you know that you want to build a personal blog around the core topic of "accomplishing your bucket list."The next move to take from here is to ask yourself, how will others relate to your topic? (Especially that it is a very personal one)As I proposed before, you have to think how you will connect your main topic to any of the three:A problemA world-viewA unique messageTo help you understand the importance of connecting your topic to a concept that your audience will "resonate" with, I'll give you some examples. Below are sites with their topic and their "core message." I'll only be providing three, one each for the three types.Fizzle.co](mailto:vincent.imbat@gmail.com)

A problem-centered site

Topic: Launching, maintaining and scaling online businesses

Message: Persevere as an online entrepreneur with high quality training and a community that supports you.

A world-view site

Topic: Unconventional strategies in work, travel and life

Message: Reject conventional thinking on work, travel and life

[Daveursillo.com](http://daveursillo.com/)

A unique message site

Topic: Writing and spirituality

Message: Be unapologetically you.

I hope you get the idea.

It's not enough that you have a topic (or topics), you have to have a message that people can resonate with. So the question you have to answer is:

"What message can you derive from your topic which you can teach your readers?"

You need introspection to understand this. Honestly, me myself, I haven't come up with a concrete message yet with my own site. That is why, I am doing the same introspection right now. But this is necessary to differentiate you from other bloggers and to guide your writing.

Since you seem to resonate with the third option, here are some articles you might want to study.

A world-view blog is somewhat related to a unique message blog only that a world-view blog tends to attract more readers but also more haters because of its divisive tendencies.

Even if you don't plan to go through this path, you can still learn something from world-view blogs and how they are built and maybe you can bring some of the techniques from these blogs to arrive on a unique message for your own blog. Here is an article that might help you:

DON'T MAKE THIS PART TOO HARD

My goal is once you get an idea of your core message no matter how bleak it is, I want you to start blogging already. Maybe next week, you can reserve your domain name and I'll teach you the technicals.

So don't spend a lot of time here. Just use your gut feel.

Your blog will evolve as you evolve as a person. Just start with what makes sense right now. Don't worry, I'll teach you how to change focus in the future if you ever feel like you want to change focus. Just nail that message and start writing about it.

ASSIGNMENT

After reading the articles, tell me what you think about them and respond with the core message that you want to deliver in your blog.

Enjoy the process Keith.

This is exciting :)

Vince
