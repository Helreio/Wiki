# Loss and Grief

I will lose Mama.

I will lose Papa.

I will lose Bernice.

I will lose Ate Mau.

I will lose my close relatives.

I will lose my close friends.

I will lose Doji, Chami, and Chikako.

All these being finite, I will lose them.

Loss and grief is the constant in the universe.

As long as there is change, there will be loss.

As long as there is loss, there will be grief.

Grief work, is probably the most important work for survival.
