**Action Step:** I want you to think of one tiny habit. Think of one habit that you want to build and keep that habit in mind as you progress throughout the course. Obviously, you’ll be able to apply these lessons to many habits in your life, but it helps to have one topic you can keep returning to when we get to the action steps in each video.

Habit: Meditation

Notes

Time for a habit to be built depends on its complexity

66 days average

Mindset: This journey will take a while

Missing one day does not affect the long-term outcome (junk the “all-or-nothing” mindset)

3 requirements for our habits: (1) repeated, (2) resilient, and (3) reinforcing.

**Action Step:** Ask yourself how you can make your habit more achievable, more appealing, and more activated.

Notes

Fogg Behavior Model

These three parts should occur at the same moment for a behavior to actually happen: (1) Motivation - do you want to do it, (2) Ability - can you do it, and (3) Trigger - are you prompted to do it.

3 As

(1) Is it Achievable?, (2) Is it Appealing?, and (3) Is it Activating?

Choose a habit that is achievable, appealing, and activating.

Notes

Cold Trigger - you can’t act on it right away.

Hot Trigger - you can act on it right away.

We want our triggers to be hot.

We use motivation for cold triggers, not with hot trigger.

Smartphones bring us hot triggers that we don’t actively select for ourselves.

For bad habits (time wasters, interrupters), cut the hot triggers.

For good habits, translate their cold triggers into hot triggers.

### Lesson 7: How to Set an Anchor Task and Fit New Habits Into Your Life

**Action Step:** [Lesson 7: Anchor Task worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UgtYT6v1yV-RwdcTulDv8D5GRcz2v7iztjccaZErNSs/edit?usp=sharing) and complete the Habit Stacking Exercise. Write out a list of the current habits that you do each day. (Don’t forget about all the boring everyday routines.) Then, write out a second list of the habits you want to start. Finally, pick one habit and look for the appropriate place to stack it.

Fill out this sentence: After/Before [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].

Notes

Habit Stacking - stack the habit you want to perform on something you are already doing.

On the worksheet, write down the habit you want to build, then write down a 2-minute strategy for kickstarting that behavior.

Notes

Book: The Creative Habit

Make the very beginning of the action as achievable as possible.

Don’t look at the habit in its full scope.

The 2-Minute Strategy - Not all habits can be done in 2 minutes but all habits can be started in 2 minutes. Start a habit in 2 minutes or less.

Motivation comes after starting a behavior, not before.

How can you make your behavior easier at first even if it’s not impressive.

**Action Step:** Set an upper bound or upper limit for your habit.

**Notes**

Stick with a pace you can sustain.

Set an upper bound for your habit.

Upper bound helps you maintain consistency and repetition.

**Notes**

Goldilocks Rule - to achieve peak motivation, operate at the perimeter of your abilities. Not too hard, not too easy, just right. Enough to motivate you, enough to be achievable.

50-50 odds

20-25% more

**Notes**

The way to radically change your behavior is to radically change your environment.

Human behaviors are heavily contextual; they depend on the situation in which they occur.

The environment is the trigger.

### Lesson 15: What to Do When Your Willpower is Weak

**Download:** [Video (MP4)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+15-+What+to+Do+When+Your+Willpower+is+Weak.mp4) | [Audio (M4A)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+15-+What+to+Do+When+Your+Willpower+is+Weak.m4a)

**Action Step:** [Lesson 15: Environment Design worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iK2Pc7ydvWveYQAcWLhZbSK8LqHD-cf3KNi5lZUML-0/edit?usp=sharing) and write out a few examples of how you could design your environment to promote your habit. You want more steps between you and a negative behavior, and fewer steps between you and a positive behavior.

**Notes**

Choice Architecture - People choose something simply because it was presented to them as an option not necessarily because it is something we constantly seek out. If we can change the architecture of how options are presented to us each day, we will make different choices.

Optimize your home or work environment by putting better options spaces that are more visible (ex: put healthier foods at eye level and taking unhealthy foods less visible).

Optimize your environment to make the good habits easier and the bad habits harder.

Designing for Laziness

- Use small plates when eating.

Structure your environment to make the choices automated and have better options rather than trying to fight through the environment.

### Lesson 16: How to Achieve More With Less Effort

**Download:** [Video (MP4)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+16-+How+to+Achieve+More+With+Less+Effort.mp4) | [Audio (M4A)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+16-+How+to+Achieve+More+With+Less+Effort.m4a)

**Action Step:** [Lesson 17: Make Good Habits Automatic worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wnsxXB55BSktISaI5HggfY2XLcrThm9a2BoaaGmQbnI/edit?usp=sharing) and ask yourself the following: How do you currently go about the behavior? What are the distractions that pull you off course? How can you re-design your environment to minimize those distractions?

**Notes**

Designing your environment to avoid bad habits is a faster way to winning and maintaining consistency.

They won’t improve your habits but they will maintain consistency.

To boost your overall average you can either increase the win of your best days or increase the win of your average days (the latter maintains consistency).

Focus on missing fewer workouts than increasing your motivation during workouts.

Instead of sticking to a new diet plan, just decrease the unhealthy food you are eating.

Instead of increasing income, focus on saving more.

Make addition by subtraction (lessening trash).

Lessen the negative days.

**Action Step:** List 10 examples of how you can step into the flow of your normal day and place a reminder or hot trigger that will help you stick with the habit you're looking to perform.

**Notes**

How can you design your environment so that the triggers that you come across will remind you within the flow of your normal day?

Capitalize on the environment that you are already in. Shift it slightly to give way to the goals you set for yourself.

**Download:** [Video (MP4)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+30-+Why+It%27s+So+Easy+to+Get+Hooked+on+Bad+Habits.mp4) | [Audio (M4A)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+30-+Why+It%27s+So+Easy+to+Get+Hooked+on+Bad+Habits.m4a)

Notes

Bad habits are easier to form than good habits.

Timing consistency - we treat time in our brains for present things and future things.

Your present self is different from your future self. Each of these selves value things differently.

It’s easy to think about future goals when you’re thinking of the future self.

But when it’s time to do the real work towards the future self, it becomes difficult because what does the real work is the present self and the present self values immediate reward, instant gratification more than long-term outcomes.

Future Self (Long-term Rewards) vs Present Self (Instant Gratification) -> We say one thing, we do another thing

Bad habits = falling into instant gratification at every particular moment

How to break bad habits?

1. Shift the rewards of the future and put them at the present moment.
2. Take the reward of the present moment and add an immediate pain together with the immediate pleasure making bad habits less likely to occur.

### Lesson 31: How to Spot the Root Causes of a Bad Habit

**Download:** [Video (MP4)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+31-+How+to+Spot+the+Root+Causes+of+a+Bad+Habit.mp4) | [Audio (M4A)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+31-+How+to+Spot+the+Root+Causes+of+a+Bad+Habit.m4a)

**Action Step:** Pick up a couple sets of [notecards](http://jamesclear.com/link/mead-notecards) and spend about a week recording “who,” “what,” “when,” and “where” for your bad habits.

Notes

In order to solve a bad habit you have to be aware of it.

Notecard method - spot the root causes of your bad habits. Take notice when you do a bad habit and write down: (1) who - the people with you, (2) what - what you are doing, (3) when - the time it happened and what happened before and after that, and (4) where - your location.

Why we do this? We need to understand the triggers, the prompts, that cause the bad habits and resolve them by eliminating them or coming up with a better solution for when those triggers recur (an alternative to the bad habit).

Do it for one week and you will get enough data to let you know what drives your habit and what doesn’t.

Bad habits are often complex and multi-layered. So we need a tracker to be fully aware of what really is driving our bad habits.

**Download:** [Video (MP4)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+32-+How+to+Break+a+Bad+Habit+Once+and+For+All.mp4) | [Audio (M4A)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+32-+How+to+Break+a+Bad+Habit+Once+and+For+All.m4a)

**Action Step:** [Lesson 32: Break a Bad Habit for Good worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZFXmM8zz5Ctz2zxXLZTcexyzV_IOGMsuNr8B_hIaQg/edit?usp=sharing) and write down a bad habit that you'd like to break, then come up with at least 3 different divisions for how you can move that habit forward.

Notes

Identity-based habits

Progressive Extremism - adopt an identity that you want to become but only in a small sliver - extreme but tiny - and then progressively move that line forward.

Example: red meat -> chicken -> fish

Pick some boundary that doesn’t seem intimidating to you in the beginning that you can actually adopt this identity and then you can progressively move that line forward.

Cut a habit in one context of your life and then move it ahead.

### Lesson 33: How to Get Out of the All-or-Nothing Mindset

**Download:** [Video (MP4)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+33-+How+to+Get+Out+of+the+All-or-Nothing+Mindset.mov) | [Audio (M4A)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+33-+How+to+Get+Out+of+the+All-or-Nothing+Mindset.m4a)

**Action Step:** Brainstorm at least 3 ways that you can reduce the scope and stick to the schedule when something distracts or constrains you.

Notes

Bad habits are often the result of convenience - all or nothing mindset - “if I can’t do it then I’ll just get back to my bad habit.”

Solution: Reduce the scope but stick to the schedule.

Doesn’t mean that since you can’t perform the full scope of the habit, you’re not going to stick to it anymore.

By doing this you increase the resilience of your habit.

Goal: No more O days - days when you do nothing.

Notes

It is the interaction of our habits, the invisible forces, and feedback that make up our every day behaviors.

Systems vs. Goals

Goals are not what drive us towards a result.

Systems, the process we follow, that lead to the result.

Garden Metaphor

- Soil = Environment
- Fertilizer, water, sun = Feedback
- Seed = Your genetics

It is the connection of all these three that make up the achieved behavior.

Look at each of these tactics and techniques as tools in your toolbox.

There is no magic pill.

One technique will not apply to all aspects of your life.

It is a continual effort, a continual process.

This module is a collection of additional, unrelated thoughts on how to build better habits.

### Lesson 35: The Power of Culture and Social Situation to Shape Our Behavior

**Download:** [Video (MP4)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+37-+The+Power+of+Culture+and+Social+Situation+to+Shape+Our+Behavior+.mov) | [Audio (M4A)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+37-+The+Power+of+Culture+and+Social+Situation+to+Shape+Our+Behavior+.m4a)

**Notes**

The peers we have, the groups we hangout with, influence our behavior.

We imitate the people that surround us.

If you want to build a habit, join a culture where the habit you want to achieve is a normal behavior, and gain dramatic success.

When y0u are surrounded with them, you begin to be surrounded by different triggers and rewards that reinforce your habit.

### Lesson 36: Master One Thing At a Time

**Download:** [Video (MP4)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+38-+Master+One+Thing+At+a+Time.mp4) | [Audio (M4A)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+38-+Master+One+Thing+At+a+Time.m4a)

**Action Step:** [Master One Thing worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Limygp-lC7GLQUtzIzy3zFKECsb-LZXe-GGdRqYHhfU/edit?usp=sharing) and rank and order the habits you want to adopt.

Our attention and focus may conflict to one another

Goal competition - they can’t both work so we have to choose one.

Implementation Intentions work best when you work on one goal and not multiple goals.

Habits according to importance

1. Sleep at 10 pm every day
2. Wake up at 6 am every day
3. Eat healthy foods
4. Exercise 30 minutes every day
5. Write great work

### Lesson 37: The Chemistry of Building Better Habits

**Download:** [Video (MP4)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+39-+The+Chemistry+of+Building+Better+Habits.mp4) | [Audio (M4A)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+39-+The+Chemistry+of+Building+Better+Habits.m4a)

**Action Step:** [The Chemistry of Building Better Habits worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jM1glHoDy2IfFkBw5wJtRULKra6UBaLbbcvDt-HM9uc/edit?usp=sharing) and list out the constraints you face when it comes to building your habit. Then, think of at least 3 ways you can simplify your habit and overcome those constraints.

**Notes**

Build small habits.

Our habits have equivalent activation energies.

The bigger the habit the bigger the required activation energy.

Reduce the activation energy required to start your habit.

The lower the activation energy, the more likely that you will perform something.

The way to lower the activation energy of a habit is to make it simpler to perform.

The best way to simplify your habits is to think about the constraints that you face at that time.

Either get around or overcome the constraint over that given habit.

### Lesson 38: How We Convince Ourselves to Keep Falling for the Same Excuses

**Download:** [Video (MP4)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+40-+How+We+Convince+Ourselves+to+Keep+Falling+for+the+Same+Excuses.mp4) | [Audio (M4A)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+40-+How+We+Convince+Ourselves+to+Keep+Falling+for+the+Same+Excuses.m4a)

**Action Step:** Think about the excuses you typically state for why you don't or can't do something. Ask yourself if that's actually a core, justifiable reason for not doing something, or if you're falling into a justification loop.

**Notes**

The word “because” is a strong trigger that move us to make excuses and not proceed with our habits.

### Lesson 39: Self-Awareness

**Download:** [Video (MP4)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+41-+Self-Awareness.mp4) | [Audio (M4A)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+41-+Self-Awareness.m4a)

Notes

Only by looking at something deeply can we really understand what something is like.

Observe your habits deeply and find a way to measure them closely.

We need tools to track and measure our habits to make them stick. What gets measured, gets improved.

### Lesson 40: Overlap Principle

**Download:** [Video (MP4)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+42-+Overlap+Principle.mov) | [Audio (M4A)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/HMC/Lesson+42-+Overlap+Principle.m4a)

**Action Step:** List at least 3 ways that you can approach the same habit and make your habit more resilient.

**Notes**

Overlap different methods to maintain the same habit and make it more likely that you’ll follow through.

You need to have a variety of ways or options to make a habit occur.

When a habit only occurs when conditions are optimal and perfect then its not going to be a habit for very long.
