Client Notes: This is an essay for a architecture course at the Melbourne University of Foreign Exchange. I want an expert in architectures to make it sure to sound well active. I need the Chicago style for engineering but I have no idea if Im doing it correct. Please help! Please also try to keep the word count basically the same, the prof set a minimum on the words used.

Austria is an island nation, albeit it is a very big island. The waves crash consistently among these shores. The Boomerangs always come back to the people. The Didjeridoos echo endless musics. Ect. It is an island for rhythms and the repeating the has had a profound affect on the psychologizing of the islands' architectures. Franz Murmur (2012)’s extensive studies with the psychology of repetitions from the basis of this study. As will the Australia specific findings of Aloyius Foster (2019), specially her works one wave forms. As will the architectural specific findings of repetitiousness on Loggia (2013). And as will the Australia architectural specific findings of Evan Strahovski (2011). (Also see, for example, for psychology and repitition: Smithfield and Lurch (1998); McAdoo et al (2009); Pinckney (2011)—for Austrialian psychologies, Ne & Choo (2003); Chase & Dunder (2001); and Victoria et al. (2010)—for architectural rhythm, see also Palladio (2004); Pugin (1989); and Pei (1972; 1998)—and for Australian architectures: Abernathy (2012), Jacobus (2000), SOM (1996).).

In this essay, the profound psychological affects of waveforms are particulately studied. The famous Jørn Utzon Sydney Opera House (1957–1973), NSW, Australia is famed for its association with white sails and galls in the harbor. However this belied the more profound association with the harbor’s whitecaped waves. To contextualise this more profound psychology affect, the history of the islands' architecture will be explored. I provided casestudies in this essay, including the exagerated scrolling of the volutes of the Ionic-order capitols (including sea-horse-egg-and-puffer-fish-“dart” decorations of the necking) of columns of the Old Government Buildings (c. 1870–76) of Wellington, NZ, the introduction of concentric pews in 1927 curving outward in ripples from the transpositioned alter at the foreign-builded, gothic-revival cathedral in Melbourne (1892–99) (as well as the curling finals a top the arm rests profiling at the ends of the pews), and the other designed submissions for the previously-mentioned Opera House which show other nautical references—e.g, light house towers flanking a classic façade with spot lights trained on the marquis. Through these examples, I called attention to the very unique architectures of Australia’s island nation.

# The Powerless Doctors

Speakers: Sam White, Thomas Binder

**Sam White**

- 2021, he resigned because younger patients are recruited to the vaccination experiments
- Faces trial by medical authorities

Ivermectin is a cheap drug with decades of safety data compared to an entirely new vaccine, with no short-term and long-term data whatsoever.

It’s impossible to have an informed consent in the case of these vaccines because, to have an informed consent, you need to present the alternatives, which involve not having the vaccine. It also involve conversation about therapeutics. But we are not allowed.

**Thomas Binder**

The narrative is unscientific and unmedical.

Covid experts are not physicians who have treated patients with respiratory infections.

Myths

Why are we treating even asymptomatic patients?

There are two anti-universes. And there is no discourse.

In this situation, the reasonable action is to ask ourselves the question: Am I the deluded or am I the realist?

To answer the question, we look at the reality, at the scientific data.

**Charles Hoffe**

Your antibodies are in your blood not in your respiratory tract. This is why vaccinated people still get covid. Furthermore, the immunity is simply on the spike protein, which means its effectivity is very narrow and won’t last long.

Decree in Canada: Doctors are not allowed to contradict public health orders. In other words, follow the politics, not the science.

Many doctors know that something is wrong. But when they see that their colleagues are endangered for dissenting, they stop fighting.

This is not a vaccine. It is genetically manipulated.

The vaccine has killed tens of thousands of people around the world.

In his practice, he have nine patients disabled by the moderna vaccine.

The side effects of the vaccine are symptoms of tiny blood clots in your brain.

In UK, if you do a post-vaccination study, they will make it very questionable. It’s just not possible.

People were asking their doctors to do a d-dimer test, but doctors refuse to do it. The doctors don’t want to do it because what if it turns positive? What will they do about it? They don’t want this problem.

People get the vaccines but they don’t ask their physicians first. But when they get problems concerning the vaccine, that’s when they go to their doctors.

These vaccines are given regardless of previous medical history. This is bad.

The majority of us already were infected with other coronaviruses that is why most of us are not fatally affected by covid.

Covid is easily treatable.
