# How will you argue for or against the notion that thought is energy and it is transformed into matter.

Is energy conceptual or physical (meaning spatio-temporal).

If energy is conceptual then it needs the mind to exist, because the existence of concepts are mind-dependent.

But it seems like with or without consciousness, energy will exist, out there.
