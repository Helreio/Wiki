The Best Diet: The One That Works for You

---

Even a slight decrease in calories, preferably on a plan that meets nutritional needs, is all it takes.

---

"We know from research studies that almost any plan that reduces calorie intake results in weight loss, regardless of whether it's high-carbohydrate, low-carbohydrate, high in protein, or low in fat."

---

Weight loss won't last unless you change your eating and exercise habits for good in a way that meshes with your food preferences, schedule, and lifestyle.

---

Dieter, Let's Get Personal

---

"Knowing who you are and what you need is the most important information you can have when it comes to losing weight, eating healthy, and changing your lifestyle,"

---

people who successfully lose weight and keep it off have simply discovered which approaches work for them and their unique personalities.

---

Do you prefer to eat three, five, or eight meals a day? Once you determine your desired eating schedule, divide your calories accordingly.

---

How much time will you devote to food preparation? If you hate to cook, or have limited time, you'll need to simplify the preparation of healthy, fresh, and lightly processed foods.

---

What type of support, and how much, do you require?

---

Do you love to dine out? You'll need to account for restaurant food by seeking out the calorie counts of the foods you eat most often.

---

Will you require a daily treat to feel satisfied? If you can't live without a little something special every day, reserve 100 calories for a single-serve package of cookies or chips, or for a frozen treat, like a fudge bar.

---

How much exercise can you reasonably do? Experts recommend at least 30 minutes a day of moderate physical activity, such as walking, on most days of the week, but you may have to build up to that, especially if you aren't physically active. Ask your doctor what's best for you. Continued

Calculating Calories For Weight Loss

---

Diets don't work unless you run a calorie deficit by eating less energy than you burn. Most healthy people without chronic conditions can safely drop no more than two pounds a week on a balanced diet.

---

Adhering to a daily calorie budget for weight loss is the crux of any successful do-it-yourself diet plan. Your calorie allowance is based on your age, sex, physical activity level, and weekly weight loss goals.

---

Once you have calculated your calorie level, the next step is figuring out what to eat for weight loss. Bauer says the best diet plans are based on whole foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy foods, because they lay the foundation for a lifetime of healthy eating.

---

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's [MyPyramid.gov](http://MyPyramid.gov) web site provides a blueprint for healthy eating, no matter what your weight goal. The number of servings to include on a daily basis from each of the five food groups, and oils, is determined by the calorie level you choose for weight loss. [MyPyramid.gov](http://MyPyramid.gov) also provides information about proper portions for foods in each food group. Continued

How to Design Your Daily Meals and Snacks

---

You know how many servings from each of the food groups you need. Now you need to decide how to combine them to make healthy, satisfying meals and snacks that keep temptation at bay.

---

Have at least three meals a day. Eating on a regular basis prevents extreme hunger that can wreak havoc on your resolve to eat better and exercise more.

---

Stay fuller for longer by combining protein (found in the greatest amounts in foods from the milk and meat/beans food groups) with fiber (found in whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and legumes) at every meal and snack.

---

Conserve calories. Choose the lowest-calorie choices from each food group.

---

Prevent Portion Distortion, At Home and Away

---

All foods fit on a balanced weight control plan, but proper portions are paramount.

---

If you're uncertain what constitutes reasonable serving sizes–and let's face it, most of us are -- invest in a reliable kitchen scale, measuring cups, and measuring spoons to determine portions at home. If exactitude isn't your style, learn how to compare correct portion sizes to everyday objects, such as a baseball, a deck of playing cards, and a light bulb.

---

Correctly eyeballing portions is particularly helpful when dining out. It's a useful skill to have, because it's unlikely you'll be eating every meal at home.

---

counteracting extra calories with physical activity.
