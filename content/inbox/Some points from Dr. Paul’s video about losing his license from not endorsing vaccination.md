# Some points from Dr. Paul’s video about losing his license from not endorsing vaccination

After vaccination, his patients children regressed into autism.

Vaccination is too controversial. It’s like religion and politics.

Informed consent

Because he wasn’t following CDC guidelines, doctors wanted to remove his license

Unvaccinated patients were healthier

Doctors as expected to keep a standard of care. Standard means that all doctors are expected to do the same thing. This prevents innovation. It is as if they say that THIS IS SCIENCE, which is wrong. Because science should constantly respond to changes in evidence.

Numerous physicians in California have lost licenses over just writing a medical excemption.

The practice of medicine should be individualized. It should be between a physician and a patient. It should not be about a big entity and the patient.

Censoring information will be the downfall of society.

Now you can get a COVID vaccine anywhere not from your physician, where you could get a discussion about the pros and cons, why? Because there is no discussion about the pros and the cons.

People spent so much billions of dollars for something they’ll give for free. Nothing in the world is free. If the vaccine is given for free, there could be an agenda behind that.
