# Three elements of an effective personal knowledgement system

An effective personal knowledge management system would need the following elements:

1. **An understanding of one's interests**

Understand your most important interests.

This understanding acts as a filter that manages the inflow of information. If we are interested about everything all at once, we will be overwhelmed with information we can’t manage. Therefore, we need to be more intentional with our choice of information to keep up with what truly matters. One way of creating a filter for information flow is the Richard Feynman question: “What 12 problems am I most interested in?” This is a good question, because it helps us establish some measure of focus (not too much and not too little), while at the same time making sure that we stay motivated because we only follow our interest.

2. **A regular (ideally daily) note-writing practice**

Establish a daily note-writing practice.

Personal knowledge management is like gardening. It needs regular—ideally, daily—dedication to cultivate one’s ideas. This is especially true if the work you do relies on ideas (knowledge work). A note-writing practice consists of habits:

- Capture habit - which should ideally become automatic
- Clarify habit - weekly is enough or as needed
- Organize -weekly or as needed
3. **A system of tools and workflows**

Choose the right tools embedded in the right workflows that work for you.
