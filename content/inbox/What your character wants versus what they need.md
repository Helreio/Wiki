# What your character wants versus what they need

22 Highlights from What your character wants versus what they need

---

have you considered what they want versus what they need?

---

external versus internal motivation

---

What your character wants

---

At the outset of your novel, you need to establish what it is your character wants – what it is that they are pursuing? What do they believe will give them a feeling of satisfaction?

---

they know what it is that will make their life complete. Or so they think.

---

What your character needs

---

there is something else under the surface, and that is what your character needs.

---

There are very few things human beings actually need, in order to be happy, and most of the things we fixate on wanting only obscure the really important things.

---

The things we need can usually be distilled to one thing: love.

---

I’m talking about compassion, and this comes in two key forms: love of self, and love of others.

---

Weave the ‘want’ and ‘need’ into two sides of the same coin

---

For a moving character transformation, your character’s ‘want’ will have been intrinsically linked to their ‘need’ from the very beginning – usually as a false compensation.

---

The character’s preoccupation with their want creates their fundamental flaw

---

The next stage is to ensure that the character’s want isn’t only not what they really need, but is actively harmful. As long as they see their want as their key to happiness, that happiness will only be more elusive. Not only that, it may be destructive in a wider sense, to those around them.

---

Make your character face their flaw and face the consequences of their choice

---

A powerful way to end your story is to confront your protagonist with their flaw, by giving them a choice between their ‘want’ and their ‘need’.

---

If your character sacrifices their want and chooses their need, then they will ultimately be fulfilled.

---

However, if they shun their need and seize their want, then they will be doomed to continue in misery.

---

Either ending is fine, depending on whether you want a happy ending or a sad one.

---

Summary

---

To recap, to master want versus need you need to:

---

work out what your character wants versus what they need see how the two are intrinsically linked investigate how their want creates their flaw demonstrate how their choice between their want and need leads to direct consequence
