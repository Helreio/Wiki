# We can live without articulating our purpose

It seems possible to continue living without thinking about purpose or the meaning of life. [[Richard Feynman]] even went as fas as to suggest that, “[[Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. - Richard Feynman]]” He said that we should just follow what is interesting for us (cf. [[Use curiosity to guide your thinking]]) like children ([[Children don’t seem to think about purpose]]).

I think it is quite possible to go about life without thinking or articulating its meaning and one’s relationship with it (cf. [[You can be happy without being philosophical]]). This is is because, this philosophizing is simply a form of [[thoughts/action]]. It is not a [[Quality of action]] (see [[Primary vs secondary purposes]]). And [[Quality of action is what makes us happy]]. If I [[inbox/live in the now]] (i.e., pursue my primary purpose), I’ll be good experientially.

So, some good rules of thumb in living are:

- [[Cultivate mindfulness then follow your bliss]].
- [[Focus on what feels good and purpose will follow]].

The problem with this approach to living is that, for some, it isn’t enough. It isn't a universal motivation. This way of life puts a lot of importance to [[thoughts/happiness]]. It is a hedonic approach to living. But happiness is not the only value worth going after and it isn't even the ultimate value to pursue (because there is no such thing). For many, meaning is more important, and [[Happiness is not the same as meaning]]. For people who desire more meaning in their lives, articulating purpose could be a very important project.

That said, a hybrid approach could be to use this child-like playfulness to arrive at purpose ([[Focus on what feels good and purpose will follow]]).
