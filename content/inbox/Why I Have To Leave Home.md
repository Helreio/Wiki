# Why I Have To Leave Home

Life at home has not been optimal.

I want to live in a place where there is absolutely no one burning their garbage.

I also think I can grow my financial skills more if I live totally separate from my parents.

Withdrawing from the drugs and optimizing my health is priority number one.

It's good to have company but honestly, I'm closer to the dogs than my parents.

I am highly doubtful that they can help me through this. They're no longer interested. And they're also an stressor.

If I withdraw from the drugs then I am on my own. Given that Precious does not seem to be interested joining me.

What will be my next move?

My moves will be divided between 3 categories

Work part-time

Work full-time

Intermittent work

I am weak with my emotional state - anxious with money, etc.

- Perhaps do an internal CBT here.
- Modify how "security" is not confined in a salary job

I dont have enough profitable skills that would

A. Fulltime + investing

Drawback of a fulltime job is that there is no enough time to develop other skills.

B. Part-time/ intermittent + skills + simple life + emergency fund

Define objectives

Compare future based on these objectives
