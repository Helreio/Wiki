# Combine curiosity with a note-writing system and practice

[[Use curiosity to guide your thinking]]. However, you need to track your tinkering through a note-writing system like [[Talahardin]]. This combination of curiosity, an external system to capture interests and ideas, and a regular practice is a natural way to develop insights.

Using curiosity as the driving force for thinking can only be possible if you write ([[Writing is the best facilitator for thinking]]) and [[Use a note-writing system]], which follows a workflow that optimizes freedom ([[A good workflow optimizes freedom]]).
