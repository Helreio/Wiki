# 2020-03 Monthly report

## Summary

Half of this month was spent continuing my intention to live each day as if it was the last. I traveled myself and joined Tita Villa and our family in trips around Pangasinan. However, on March 13, while I am slowly picking myself up from the tinnitus, my life would again change dramatically. Just after getting back with Lea, we were again forced apart due to th COVID 19 pandemic. We will not see each other in person again for the next 300 days. Meanwhile, I was stuck at home with my parents and my sister, which, although initially fun, also created tension. Despite this new challenge on top of my tinnitus, I was able to write and publish a lot of essays this month.

## Good Events

- Meditated at Baguio with Ate Elda and Donna.
- Went to another trip with Tita Villa and extended family: Ate at Adriano’s eat all you can, ate ice cream at Pap’s, enjoyed Farmville at San Fabian.
- Treated Tita Villa for lunch with Papa and Bernice.
- Celebrated Lea’s birthday by going to La Mesa Ecopark and eating at Meshwe
- Bonded with Lea’s siblings to celebrate her birthday: Watched a movie, ate at Shakey’s, then played Monopoly
- Bonded with Rem and Benjie at Candent Learning Haus
- Bonded with Rainier (learned that he also has tinnitus)
- Took Mari Andrew’s course in skillshare to do something with Lea while far from her.

## Setback and Challenges

- Duterte declared that a nationwide quarantine will start on March 15, prompting me to go home to Pangasinan immediately on March 13. This started 300 difficult days of not seeing Lea or my friends in NCR, facing difficult family dynamics with Bernice at home, and ultimately convincing me that I need to leave Pangasinan for good.
