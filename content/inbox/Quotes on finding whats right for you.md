# Quotes on finding whats right for you

Monday morning inspiration:

“......believing that you're enough is what gives you the courage to be authentic, vulnerable, and imperfect.....when we don't have that, we shape-shift and turn into chameleons; we hustle for worthiness we already possess”

- [ ] Brene Brown

"Sometimes, it takes darkness and the sweet confinement of your aloneness to learn anything or anyone that does not bring you alive is too small for you.”

- [ ] David Whyte
