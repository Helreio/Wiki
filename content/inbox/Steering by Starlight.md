# Steering by Starlight

My fears

I don't have enough friends

I will not be happy until I have my own land

Things will be better if I have better parents

1. Think of something you recently did for someone you love. What was it?

Treating Mama and Papa at Pizza Hut

Shackles on

Shorts

Shackles off

Write teen pregnancy overview

Shackles on

Cleaning my bookshelf

Shackles off

The woman selling ulam

Shackles on

Bookbright -> I will learn farming then live in a gift economy

Precious -> I will find someonw who is closer to who I am

Living with my parens Sta. Maria -> I will surround myself of people like me

Afraid to live away

Will feel alone

Will not find a community

Will suffer from withdrawals if I stop my meds

At auntie's funeral

At the frontrow seminar

At Honrado reunions

My holistic understanding of the world

My mind

My desire to learn

My childhood creative years

Having cousins, studying in CMS

My father not being me with toys I want

Having no brother

Having no friends around the neighborhood

I was destined to have a beautiful mind.

Because of this destiny, something negative happened. My father didn't buy me the toys I want, I didn't have a brother, and I didn't have friends around the neighborhood.

Fortunately, this led to my very creative childhood years.

And that, sports fans, is how destiny brought me my Favorite Thing.
