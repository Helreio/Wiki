# My search for my authentic writing voice is an extension of my pursuit for freedom

To find [[My writing voice]], I need to let go of writing conventions. This is easier said than done because [[It is uncomfortable to write against writing conventions]].

But finding my authentic writing voice is so critical because it maximizes [[Freedom]]. Freedom means what works for me might not work for you. Freedom is the pursuit of what works for me (i.e., [[Freedom requires self-reliance]]). When I pursue freedom in writing, I define what works for me, which does not always correspond to the norm.

Most writing advice comes from Western writers the majority of which only write in English. Meanwhile, I am a Pangasinense living in a Tagalog region who writes mostly in English. [[My context as a writer]] necessitates that I go against the norm and do my own thing.
