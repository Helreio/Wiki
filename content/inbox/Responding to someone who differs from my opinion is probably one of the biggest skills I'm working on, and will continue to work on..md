# Responding to someone who differs from my opinion is probably one of the biggest skills I'm working on, and will continue to work on.

It takes up a lot of energy from me in such a way that is distasteful that I notice I have consciously and intentionally avoided opportunities where I can practice it.

I go in constant difference with the groups I chose to associate with. Usually, I choose acquaintances based on their attitude and our chemistry. Always by the gut I can tell when a reationship will thrive. But, this means that usually I am with people who I gel with in attitude but not in views of the world. Some are irrational if judged from my worldview. Some are too conservative, too traditional, and too pro-institutions. In chemistry I am one with them. In thought I am not.

That is why I always experience bothersome nights, afternoons, or days, when I just want to withdraw from these groups and be at home by myself. Feeling frustrated sometimes, that I will never be able to find my tribe and be with them.

But such is life. Such is the world. The real world. Not the ideal utopia that has fascinated the likes of me.

In the real world, the uniqueness and individuality of each person is pronounced, only briddled by the state or corporations or whatever powerful beings.

And that world, that world of freedom and individuality, isn't that what I desire? If autonomy is what I want, then I shouldn't bother to think that all men must think like I do. They have their own minds and freedoms, as complicated as mine, which they too are trying to contend with

Therefore, when someone disagrees with me, first, I should celebrate this. That is freedom manifesting! However, that freedom is unique to that person and I have my own freedom to proclaim, my own preferences.

Communication becomes the only relevant thing in such scenario. The goal is the service of freedom through conscious construction of peace, a project only possible through communication.

At this point, communication can go to two different ways: violent or nonviolent.

It is here where I see the relevance of praxeology as a body of knowledge: it is a practical tool, a construct, that pushes my preferences forward.

But obviously, adherence to praxeology is also a preference, which I will not always share with my fellow man.

Here, I guess, the subtle tools that is common within each of us - empathy and love - play their part.

Jesus isn't stupid after all. Only most of his followers are.

Love conquers all.
