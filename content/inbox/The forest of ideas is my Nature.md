# The forest of ideas is my Nature

[[thoughts/henry david thoreau]] practiced [[Mornings are for knowledge work]]. He pieced together notes from his walks the other day, and wrote a long journal entry about them (see [[The fieldwork routine of Thoreau]]). I tried this in the past but decided to study [[Zettelkasten]] and realized that this kind of knowledge work is better for me.

The forest of ideas is my Nature. I am closer to it than to the natural world. Even when I am in nature, it is the insights that I think about. I am an introvert after all. I am more attuned to my thoughts than the physical world.

I become present to insights and the journey to uncover them and piece them together like a puzzle. Being truly present in nature is still a goal of mine. I cannot deny, [[Nature is where I feel awe]]. Whenever I spend time in Nature, I feel grounded. However, when I am thinking about an idea—whether a story or a philosophical problem I am really interested in—I feel strong.
