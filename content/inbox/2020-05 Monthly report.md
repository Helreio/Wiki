# 2020-05 Monthly report

## Summary

My adventures at home continued and extended towards the immediate environment outside the house. Due to the barangay quarantines, it was difficult to ride my bike far every day. So, some days, I would just walk in the fields at the back of our house and explore the terrain. This is a place that I have stared at since I was a child, but never truly explored, so I was happy to finally see it now. This month, I also helped Lea transition into freelancing. But my original intention was just really to help her provide for her family while the pandemic rolled out. We cooked a lot at home and I felt like, one day, I will need to learn how to cook, so I took the time to study some of Mama’s recipes and cooke them. This was the month that I also started exploring newspaper blackout poetry. I also started the Kamustahan newsletter series and my tradition of drawing friends during their birthday, by drawing Joji (although I drew her not on her birthday). One of my best achievements this month was getting off of Facebook for more than a week. This was in application of what I learned in The Science of Well-being.

## Setback and Challenges

- Catriona died (05-15-2020).
- Glitch with Bernice led to Mama, Papa, and her transfering to Cablong, which led to me staying most of the time by myself in Sta. Maria. This then convinced me that I have to leave the place already.
- Balong died (05-26-2020).

## Personal Triumphs

- I helped Lea by teaching her how to edit for Scribendi so she can work and earn while the pandemic is rolling.
