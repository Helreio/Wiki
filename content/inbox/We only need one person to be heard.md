# We only need one person to be heard

At the core of being a writer is wanting to be heard. But do writers really need a blog or a platform or an audience to be heard? The question is a question of quantity. How many people does a person need to be heard?

A person needs a minimum of one person to be heard. And interestingly, that person can be oneself because we are made up of at least two people inside us. We can talk to ourselves and we can listen to ourselves.

We donâ€™t need other people to be heard. So if we can already feel heard just by listening to ourselves, why do we desire to be heard by other people? And why do we want to be heard by two and more people?
