# I saw the baby carabao with its mother.

Its five minutes before 7 and the sun is still shining its last rays.

Its silent here.

Like my soul.

Peaceful.

Reminding itself that nothing needs to be worried about.

As long as one is connected to that inner resource of peace.

Everything will be ok.

Now is ok.

Then the next moment.

And the next.

In an unbridled dance

Of present moments

All ok
