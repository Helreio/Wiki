# What Does It All Mean?

# 1. Introduction

How to study philosophy?

- The philosophical raw material, from which philosophical writings have come from, originate directly from the world and our relation to it.
- ::The best way to begin the study of philosophy is to think about the questions directly.::
- ::Once the questions are engaged with directly, one is in a better position to appreciate the work of others.::
- Before studying philosophical theories, familiarize yourself with the philosophical questions that those theories try to answer.
- ::See some possible solutions to the questions, and see what’s wrong with them.::

What is the difference of philosophy from science and mathematics?

- Philosophy does not rely on experiments or formal methods of proof.

How is philosophy done?

- Ask questions
- Argue
- Try out ideas
- Think of possible arguments against ideas
- Wonder how concepts work

What is the main concern of philosophy?

- To question and understand very common ideas that we take for granted

What are some ideas studied in philosophy?

- Time
- Number
- Knowledge
- Language
- Right and Wrong

Why can philosophy be difficult?

- The more basic the ideas one is trying to investigate, the fewer the tools are.
- One can’t assume too much.
- One can’t take things for granted too much.
- Few of philosophy’s results go unchallenged for long.
- Most philosophical questions have not been solved, and perhaps some never will be.

# 2. How do we know anything?

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056807,120.453622)

What is the only thing you can be sure of?

- ::The inside of your own mind is the only thing you can be sure of.::
- Everything else is farther away from your inner experience and thoughts.
- Everything else reaches you only through your own mind.

Why is it not enough to conclude that there is a physical world because one senses?

- The argument that there is a physical world external from the mind is just another claim about the world and one’s relation to it.
- This claim is dependent on the evidence of one’s senses.
- One can only rely on sensual evidence if one can rely on the mind.
- ::One argues in circles if one tries to prove the reliability of one’s senses by appealing to one’s senses.::

What questions could be asked about one’s relationship with the physical world?

- What if what you see as the physical world is only in your mind?
- What if what you see as the physical world is only a giant dream from which you will never wake up? (You can’t wake up because there is no real world to wake up into)
- ::What if all your experiences is just a giant dream with no external world outside it?::
- How can you know that isn’t what’s going on?

What are the implications of the “giant dream” hypothesis?

- ::Any evidence one uses to prove that there is an outside world would just be part of the dream.::
- To know whether or not what’s inside one’s mind is a guide to what’s outside one’s mind, one can’t depend on how things seem from inside one’s mind.

So where do we get evidence to argue for what’s outside the world other than one’s mind?

- None. All evidence about anything has to come through one’s mind.

Using the “giant dream” hypothesis, what can we postulate about reality?

- It’s possible that one doesn’t have a body or a brain.
- One’s belief about the body or brain comes only through evidence from one’s senses.
- “Seeing" a body or a brain is just a "visual experience”
- ::Maybe there is no external physical world and it is only you, the subject of experience, that exists.::

What is the most radical conclusion one can draw from the “giant dream” hypothesis?

- ::Solipsism or the view that your mind is the only thing that exists.::

What is an answer to solipsism?

- ::Solipsism is a conclusion that is more than the evidence warrants.::
- One can’t know on the basis of what’s in one’s mind that there is no outside world.

What is Thomas Nagel’s conclusion about reality?

- The more modest stand: skepticism.
- ::You don’t know anything beyond your impressions and experiences.::
- There may or may not be an external world.
- If there is an external world, it may or may not be completely different from how it seems to one.

What is an stronger form of skepticism?

- ::You don’t know anything about your own past experiences because all you have to go on are the present contents of your mind.::
- If you can’t be sure that the world outside your mind exists now, how can you be sure that you yourself existed before now?
- How do you know you didn’t just come into existence a few minutes ago, complete with all your present memories?
- Evidence of your existence a few minutes ago depends on beliefs about how people and their memories are produced.
- Beliefs about how people and their memories are produced rely on what has happened in the past.
- ::To prove that you existed in the past by assuming that you existed in the past is arguing in a circle.::

What can an skeptic answer to the argument that there is an external world because internal experiences have external causes?

- ::Even if there are external causes, how can one tell from the contents of one’s experience what those causes are like? One has never observed any of them directly.::
- What is the basis of the idea that everything has to have a causal explanation? This causal explanation cannot be proved just by what’s inside one’s mind.

Why can’t science help answer the question about whether or not there is a physical world outside our minds?

- Science is just as vulnerable as perception.
- How can we know that the world outside our minds corresponds to our ideas of what would be a good theoretical explanation of our observations?
- ::If we can’t establish the reliability of our sense experiences in relation to the external world, there’s no reason to think we can rely on our scientific theories either.::

What is verificationism?

- Radical skepticism is meaningless.
- The idea of an external reality that no one could ever discover is meaningless.
- A dream has to be something from which one can wake up to discover that one has been asleep.
- Impressions and appearances that do not correspond to reality should be contrasted with those that do.
- If this is not done, the contrast between appearance and reality is meaningless.
- The idea of an “giant dream” from which one can never wake up is not a dream, it is reality.
- One's idea of the things that exist is just one's idea of what one can observe.
- Mistaken observations can be corrected by other observations.
- ::Without the possibility that there is a correct view of how things are, the thought that one’s impressions are not true is meaningless.::

What are the implications of verificationism on skepticism?

- It is not true that the only thing that exists is one’s own mind.
- It couldn’t be true that the physical world doesn’t exist unless somebody could observe that it doesn’t exist.
- Solipsism is meaningless.
- ::If the external world is subtracted, they stop being mere impressions; they become perceptions of reality.::

What does verificationism require about reality to make it correct?

- ::Verificationism requires that reality is what we can observe.::
- If there is an external world, the things in it are observable because they exist, and not the other way around.
- Existence is not the same as observability.

What is the egocentric predicament?

- ::It is not meaningless to think that the world might consist of nothing but the inside of one’s mind.::
- No one could find out that this is true without arguing in a circle.

Why is it practically impossible not to believe on things in the world around you?

- ::Our acceptance of the external world is instinctive and powerful.::

What are the implications of skepticism’s practical impossibility?

- People can’t live using skepticism.
- ::We hold on to most of our ordinary beliefs about the world in face of the fact that (a) they might be completely false, and (b) we have no basis for ruling out that possibility.::

Three meaningful questions

1. Is it a meaningful possibility that the inside of your mind is the only thing that exists - or that even if there is a world outside your mind, it is totally unlike what you believe it to be?
2. If these things are possible, do you have any way of proving to yourself that they are not actually true?
3. If you can’t prove that anything exists outside your own mind, is it all right to go on believing in the external world anyway?

# 3. Other Minds

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056744,120.453497)

How much do you really know about what goes on in anyone else’s mind?

- The only experiences you can actually have are your own.
- ::If you believe anything about the mental lives of others, it is on the basis of observing their physical construction and behavior.::

Can two human beings have exactly the same sensual experience?

- Two human beings might be able to share how they perceive one experience from another.
- ::But it is uncertain that each of their experience is the same. There is no way to know “directly.”::
- ::The correlation between stimulus and experience may not be exactly the same from one person to another.::
- Physical differences could influence individual sensual experiences.

What are the implications of denying that human sensual experiences are different?

- ::To deny the conclusion above is to assume that experiences are “uniformly correlated” with certain physical stimulations of the sense organs.::
- ::This assumption does not have an evidence and will never have any.::
- What is only observable is one’s own correlation.

“Sensual experience could be different among individuals but the differences are not radical” - what does this conclusion assume?

- ::This claim assumes that there is a correlation between a person’s "inner experience" and the "observable reaction" of another person.::
- The same skepticism could be applied.

What happens when we continuously apply this skepticism?

- We will reach a radical point where we may conclude that there is no similarity between our experiences.
- ::We will reach the most radical point: denial of the existence of other minds.::

How does a radical skepticism on the existence of other minds look?

- One can only directly observe a correlation between mind, behavior, anatomy, and physical circumstance within one’s own mind.
- One cannot directly observe this correlation in other beings.
- ::It is plausible that other beings do not have minds and that their physical behavior is simply produced by physical causes.::
- Note: when we believe things outside what we can directly observe within our own minds, we automatically enter the realm of “faith” - “faith” on things we cannot directly observe.

Why can’t you appeal to the evidence of other being’s behavior and language?

- ::Doing so assumes that their outer behavior is connected with their inner experience. You don’t know this “directly.”::

Why should we entertain the possibility that other beings do not have minds?

- ::We must entertain the possibility that the people around ourselves are not conscious because to “immediately” believe that they are conscious means we rely on instinct” - it isn’t knowledge.::

What is the implication of not relying on instinct and entertaining the possibility that there are no other minds?

- To reject instinct means to rely on something more reliable. What is it?

What is the implication of accepting that there are other minds?

- Do animals, plants, and non-living things have minds?
- Do the individual cells that make up our bodies have minds?
- Do machines have minds?
- ::Would we have any way of knowing whether or not these “others" are conscious?::

What proof can someone use to claim that “other” things are not conscious?

- Things are incapable of movement, therefore they can’t give any behavioral evidence of feeling or perception.
- Non-natural organisms have radically different internal constitution.

What question should be raised to those who claim that “other” things are not conscious?

- How can we really know that only things that behave like us to some degree and that have an observable physical structure roughly like ours are capable of having experience of any kind?
- We do not have any way of discovering the correlations between experience and observable manifestations or physical conditions.
- The correlation between other beings experience and external manifestations can only be discovered if both experience and manifestation can be observed. Only manifestation can be observed. We can’t observe internal experiences.
- At the same time, we can’t observe the “absence” of correlations and internal experiences. Only external manifestations.

Questions

1. What can you really know about the conscious life in this world beyond the fact that you yourself have a conscious mind?
2. Is it possible that there might be much less conscious life than you assume?
3. Is it possible that there might be much more conscious life than you assume?

# 4. The Mind-Body Problem

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056725,120.453567)

What is the relationship between consciousness and the brain?

What do we know about the relationship of the mind and the brain?

- ::What happens to consciousness depends on what happens to the body.::
- For anything to happen in your mind/consciousness, something has to happen in your brain.
- In some cases we know how the brain affects the mind and how the mind affects the brain.
- Science helps us understand the complex relations between what happens in the mind and the physical processes in the brain.

What philosophical question can be asked about the relationship of the mind and the brain?

- I ::s your mind something different from your brain, though connected to it, or is it your brain?::
- Are your thoughts, feelings, perceptions, sensations, and wishes things that happen in addition to all the physical processes in your brain, or are they themselves some of those physical processes?

How is the mind different from the brain?

- ::The brain can be observed by an outsider; the mind cannot be observed by an outsider.::
- Your experiences are inside your mind with a kind of insideness that is different from the way that your brain is inside your head.
- An outside observer can see what’s inside your brain but he can’t see what’s inside your mind in the same way you can.

What are the implications of this difference between the mind and the brain?

- ::If the contents of the mind are inside the mind in a different way than the contents of the brain are inside the brain, then the mind and its contents cannot just be physical states of the brain.::
- There is more to you than your body.

Explain dualism.

- Dualism is one way to solve the mind-body problem.
- It is the belief that there is a soul attached to the body in a way that allows them to interact.
- ::A person is made up of two substances: matter and mind.::

Explain physicalism (or materialism).

- ::It is the view that people consist of nothing but physical matter.::
- ::The contents of the mind are simply physical states of the brain.::
- There is no specific theory of what process in the brain can be identified as contents of the mind.
- Physicalists believe that science will be able to fit in further details.
- Mental states are “caused” by physical events and they in turn “cause” physical events. Therefore, they could be purely physical.

What could a dualist respond to a physicalist who claims that science will be able to explain what the mind is and how it interacts with the brain?

- ::The physical processes in the brain can be observed. The mental processes cannot be observed in the same way.::

What is an alternative to dualism and physicalism?

- Dual aspect theory.
- The mind goes on in the brain.
- But the contents of the mind are not physical processes of the brain.
- The brain is not just a physical object; it has mental properties as well.
- The brain is the seat of consciousness, but the conscious states are no just physical states.
- The brain itself (not the mind) has an inside that will not be observed by and outsider.
- ::You are not a body with a soul. You are just a body. But your body, or at least your brain, is not just a physical system. It is a special object with both physical and mental aspects::

Why are mental states not explainable by purely causes and effects?

- ::Mental states feel a certain way that is different from causes and effects and their physical properties.::
- Causal relations to physical stimuli and behavior cannot adequately explain mental states.

What is Thomas Nagel’s position on the mind-body problem?

- ::There is a physical reality that people can observe from the outside.::
- ::There is a mental reality that individuals experience from the inside.::
- This mental reality could also occur in animals and other beings.

What is required to have a unified physical theory of mind and body, and therefore a unified physical theory of the universe?

- ::Consciousness has to be identified with some kind of physical state.::
- We need to understand why when physical elements are constructed the right way, they produce not just a biological organism but a conscious being.

Why might it be impossible to have a physical theory of the whole of reality?

- ::Arguments against a purely physical theory of consciousness are strong enough.::

# 5. The Meaning of Words

The word and its referent

- ::There is no resemblance between a name and its referent.::
- The relationship of a word to its referent is indirect.
- You cannot understand a word by itself. You need to see its referent.

How can a word have a meaning?

- We can use definitions - using other words to define a word. But this can be circular reasoning.
- ::We must get to some words which have “direct meanings.”::

What is unusual about words?

- Very particular sounds and marks are involved in each person’s use of a word and yet the word applies to something universal.

How can a word be able to refer to all the samples of its referent in the past, present, and future?

- Something general is happening.
- It applies to everyone’s use of the word.

Concepts

- ::A word bas something else behind it: a concept.::
- ::This raises new problems because the word refers to both the stuff and the concept.::

What makes a word universal?

- Something we all have in our minds when we use the word? What is it?
- An image of the referent? But it isn’t enough to explain the generality of the word because the image is a “particular” image.

What is the mystery of meaning?

- ::It doesn’t seem to be located anywhere (not word, mind, concept.::
- Despite not knowing, we use language all the time. It allows to think complicated thoughts which span time and space.

Why language as a social phenomenon does not fully explain its universal meaning?

- ::The meaning of a word contains all its possible uses, true and false, across space and time. How is this possible?::

Language allows us to understand the universe and to invent things. The problem is how is this possible?

# 6. Free Will

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6&q=16.056725,120.453566)

What phenomena create the appearance of “free will”?

- ::While some things are determined to happen, some things do not happen until your choice determines irrevocably what will happen.::
- There were no processes or forces at work before you made your choice.

What is determinism?

- The belief that it is never possible for us to do anything different from what we actually do.
- This is because while we act based on choices, these actions are determined by the circumstances that exist before we act, making the actions inevitable.
- Factors (experiences, desires, knowledge, hereditary constitution, social circumstances, nature of choice, etc.) combine to determine a particular action inevitable.
- ::Hypothesis: There are laws of nature, like those that govern the movement of the planets, which govern everything that happens in the world–and that in accordance with those laws, the circumstances before an action determine that it will happen, and rule out any other possibility.::
- This does not mean that we can know all the laws of the universe and use them to predict all future events.

What are the implications of determinism?

- All events were predetermined by the thread of events before them.
- Everything we did were determined by circumstances before we did it.
- The set of options we have when making a choice was determined by circumstances at present and those in the past.
- We can’t blame anyone for doing something bad.
- We can’t praise anyone for doing something good.
- ::We can’t hold people responsible for their actions.::

What are some of the arguments against the implications of determinism?

- It still makes sense to praise good actions and condemn bad ones, even if they were inevitable.
- An agent acting out on the predetermined circumstances still acted on it. He can still be held responsible of his actions.
- Not punishing anyone for his actions will make him do it again.

What is Thomas Nagel’s position on blaming someone for predetermined actions?

- ::It doesn’t make sense to blame someone for doing what it was impossible for him not to do.::

What evidence do scientists use to argue that determinism is false?

- ::At a given situation, there’s more than one thing that an electron may do.::

What is an obvious implication if determinism is not true?

- ::Free will exists.::
- Responsibility is permitted.

What does “free will” require?

1. You determined what you would do, by doing it.
2. Your choice was not determined in advance.
3. Your choice did not just happen.
4. You could have done the opposite

What does it imply if you did something absent of your forces or circumstances before you did it (your desires, beliefs, personality, etc.)?

- ::It implies that the thing just happened without any explanation.::
- ::It implies that “you” didn’t do the action.::

What is an answer to the claim that free will implies that things happen with no reason?

- The claim is meaningless. Free will is just a basic feature of the world, and it can’t be analyzed. There’s a difference between something just happening without a cause and an action just being done without a cause. The difference is understandable and can’t be explained.

Why might it be the case that we are not responsible for our actions whether or not determinism is true?

- Determinism is not a threat to responsibility.
- Even if our choices are not predetermined, it is still hard to understand in what way we can do what we don’t do.
- ::If determinism is true, antecedent circumstances are responsible.::
- ::If determinism is false, nothing is responsible.::

What is an alternative view?

- For an action to be something “you” have done, it has to be produced by certain kinds of causes in you.
- If these internal causes within you did not cause it, the action just happened out of the blue.
- Causal determination by itself does not threaten freedom.
- Free action does not require that there be no determining cause at all.

Why is Thomas Nagel not agreeing with this alternative?

- ::If everything you did was determined by your circumstances and psychological condition, you would feel trapped.::
- ::If this is true with others, they can’t be held responsible for their actions.::

What is an obvious problem here?

- ::If choices are not determined by circumstance within a person, responsibility does not make sense.::
- The feeling that you could have chose differently might be an illusion.

How will this problem be resolved?

1. Explain what you mean if you say you could have done something other than what you did.
2. Explain what you and the world would have to be like for this to be true.

# 7. Right and Wrong

Is there a difference between unlawful and immoral?

- The ideas of wrong and right are different from the ideas of what is and is not against the rules.
- The ideas of wrong and right are more fundamental because they can be used to evaluate rules and actions.

What questions are raised about ethical behavior?

- Where does the desire not to do something bad come from?
- What is its motive?
- What is the reason behind it?

What is the general nature of thoughts about the wrongness of some behavior?

- ::Concern on the behavior’s effects or damages on others.::
- The thought that something is wrong depends not just of the act’s impact on one person but on other people in general, even if they didn’t find out.

What question can be raised about the wrongness of behavior that damages others?

- What if someone doesn’t care about other people?
- What reason does he have to refrain from doing any of the things usually thought to be wrong?
- If he can get what he wants by doing something considered to be wrong, why shouldn’t he?
- If there’s no reason why he shouldn’t, in what sense is it wrong?

What is one attempt to answer this problem?

- Identify something else that the person already cares about, and then connect morality to it.

What objections can be given against the religious motivation to ethical behavior?

- Plenty of people who don’t believe in God still make judgments of right and wrong.
- If God exists, and forbids what's wrong, that still isn't what makes it wrong. The act is wrong and that is why God forbids it.
- Fear of punishment, hope of reward, and love of God are not the right motives for morality. A motive for morality is care to other people.

There is no substitute for a direct concern for other people as the basis of morality.

What problem does this claim raise?

- Morality is supposed to apply to everyone.
- But not everyone has a concern for other people.
- Those who have a concern for others, only care about people they know, not everyone.

Where will we find a reason that everyone has not to hurt other people, even those they don’t know?

- Argument: “How would you like it if someone did that to you?”
- When our own interests are threatened by the inconsiderate behavior of others, we feel that they should care about it. This is the feeling that the “How would you like it?” argument is supposed to arouse.
- You did something. You resent it if someone did that thing to you. You admit that that person “has a reason” not to do that thing to you. If you admit this, you have to ask: what is that reason? The reason has to be universal. It is a reason that should compel everyone in that given situation not to do the thing. It is a reason that should “compel you” not to do the thing in that given situation.

What argument is raised against the “How would you like it if someone did that to you?” argument?

- Answer: “I wouldn’t resent it at all.”
- Most people would think that their own interests and harms matter to themselves and to other people.
- We believe that when we suffer, it is not just bad for us, but bad, period.

What is the true basis of morality?

- A belief that good and harm to particular people (or animals) is good or bad not just from their point of view, but from a more general point of view, which every thinking person can understand.
- Each person has a reason to consider not only his own interests but the interests of others in deciding what to do. Others, meaning not just those he know, but also those he don’t know - everyone.

What questions are not answered by this basis of morality?

- How should we consider the interests of others?
- How should we weigh the interests of others against the special interest we all have in ourselves and the particular people close to us?
- How much should we care about people in other countries in comparison to our fellow citizens?

What questions create disagreements among those who accept morality in general?

- Should you care about every other person as much as you care about yourself?
- Should you love your neighbor as yourself?

Why is the level of impartiality one projects an important question in moral thought?

- You matter from outside, so people have a reason to care about how they treat you.
- But you matter more from the inside.

Aside from the degree of impartiality we should project, what other problems are involved?

- Is there a single correct way for everyone to strike the balance between what he cares about personally and what matters impartially?
- Or will the answer vary from person to person depending on the strength of their different motives?

What arguments against morality’s universality can be raised?

- Wrongness is a reason for not doing.
- Reasons for doing depend on motives.
- People’s motives vary greatly.
- There won’t be a single right and wrong for everybody.
- There won't be a single right and wrong, because if people's basic motives differ, there won't be one basic standard of behavior that everyone has a reason to follow.

Among three unsatisfactory answers to the question against morality’s universal nature, which is the first?

- The same things are right and wrong for everybody.
- But not everyone has a reason to do what's right and avoid what's wrong.
- Only people with the right “moral” motives have a reason to do what’s right for its own sake.
- Problem: It is wrong for someone to do something, but he has not reason to do it?

Among three unsatisfactory answers to the question against morality’s universal nature, which is the second?

- Everyone has a reason to do what's right and avoid what's wrong
- But these reasons don't depend on people's actual motives.
- They are reasons to change our motives if they aren't the right ones.
- Problem: This connects morality with reasons for action, but leaves it unclear what these universal reasons are which do not depend on motives that everyone actually has.

Among three unsatisfactory answers to the question against morality’s universal nature, which is the third?

- Morality is not universal.
- What a person is morally required to do goes only as far as what he has a certain kind of reason to do.
- The reason depends on how much he actually cares about other people in general.
- Strong moral motives -> strong reasons and strong moral requirements.
- Problem: Goes against that idea that the same moral rules apply to all of us and not only to good people.

When is the question of morality’s universality raised?

- ::When we compare the motives of different individuals.::
- ::When we compare the moral standards of different societies at different times.::

What question should be asked about the universality of morality?

- Is it reasonable to believe that there is some single truth about all this, even though we can't be sure what it is?
- Or is it more reasonable to believe that right and wrong are relative to a particular time and place and social background?

What is the deepest form of moral relativism?

- ::The most basic standards of right and wrong depend entirely on what standards are generally accepted in the society in which one lives in.::

Why does Thomas Nagel reject this kind of relativism?

- ::It always seems possible to criticize the accepted standards of a society and say that they are morally mistaken.::
- ::To criticize a society’s moral code, means to appeal to a more objective standard of what is really right and wrong.::
- ::Problem: it isn’t clear what this objective standard is.::

What are some questions about the content of morality?

- How should a moral concern or respect for others express itself?
- Should we help other people get what they want or should we mainly refrain from harming and hindering them?
- How impartial should we be?
- In what ways should we be impartial?

What is the most foundational question about morality?

- ::How universal and objective is morality?::

What is an objection against the whole idea of morality?

- The only reason that anybody ever does anything is that it makes him feel good, or that not doing it will make him feel bad.
- If our motivation is selfish, morality cannot appeal to a concern for others.

What is an answer against this objection?

- When people do what they thing they ought to do, they feel good.
- When people do what they think is wrong, they feel bad.
- ‘But these feelings are not their motives for acting.
- Motives -> Action + Feelings
- People do what they want to do. But their reasons and motives vary enormously.

What is the problem in moral argumentation?

- ::Moral arguments appeal to a capacity for impartial motivation which is supposed to be present in all of us.::
- But this capacity may be deeply buried or not present at all in many people.
- Even if this capacity is there, it needs to compete with powerful selfish or unselfish personal motives.

What is the difficulty of justifying morality?

- ::Not that there is only one human motive, but that there are so many.::

# 8. Justice

**Two kinds of inequalities**

1. Luck - we are not responsible for people being born in certain socio-economic contexts.
2. Deliberately imposed - racial and sexual discrimination

**Questions about luck inequalities**

1. How bad are inequalities which are not the fault of the people who suffer from them?
2. Should governments use their power to try tor educe inequalities for which the victims are not responsible?

Even in a system where deliberately imposed inequalities are already eradicated, luck inequalities will exist. Equal opportunity produced unequal results.

Luck inequalities create big differences what people achieve in a competitive system.

Luck inequalities are produced by choices and actions that don’t seem wrong in themselves.

**How to tackle the problem of inequality**

1. Think about the inequality itself.
2. Then think about the remedy that would be needed to reduce or get rid of the inequality.

**Main questions to ask about the problem of inequality**

1. On the inequalities themselves: What kinds of causes of inequality are wrong?
2. On the remedies: What methods of interfering with the inequality are right?

**Answers to deliberately imposed inequality**

1. The cause of inequality is wrong because the discriminator is doing something wrong.
2. The remedy is simply to prevent him from doing it.

**Why some forms of inequalities are difficult to assess**

- Some inequalities which seem wrong can arise from causes which don’t involve people doing anything wrong.
- What’s wrong if anything is the result: that some people start life with undeserved disadvantages.
- If we object to this bad luck as unfair, we must object on the result (on people suffering) usually caused by the socioeconomic system

**Two main sources of undeserved inequalities in a competitive economy**

1. Differences in the socioeconomic classes into which people are born.
2. Differences in natural abilities or talents

There may not be anything wrong with inequality caused in these ways.

**How to remedy luck inequalities caused by differences in socioeconomic classes**

1. Interfere with the causes
2. Interfere with the unequal effects directly

**Remedies to luck inequalities**

It is difficult to interfere with the causes because these are relatively innocent choices.

It is easier to attack the inequalities directly by:

1. Taxation of income, inheritance, and some consumption.
2. Use taxes to provide for missing advantages to the poor.

**How to remedy luck inequalities caused by differences in natural abilities**

Not much we can do.

So long as there is competition, inequality will exist.

Alternative: abolish the competitive system and establish a centrally directed economy in which:

- Everyone was paid roughly the same.
- People were assigned to their jobs by some kind of centralized authority.

Disadvantages of this system:

- Heavy costs in freedom
- Heavy costs in efficiency

**How to get rid of luck inequalities caused by differences in natural abilities without removing the competitive economy**

Attack inequalities directly through:

- Higher taxation of higher incomes
- Free provision of public services to everyone, or to people with lower incomes
- Negative income tax: cash payments to those whose earning power is lowest

Implications of these methods:

- They will not get rid of the undeserved inequalities “completely”.
- Taxation will have other effects on the economy (effects on employment and the poor).

Philosophical problem

- Use of government power to interfere with what people do because it contributes to an effect which seems unfair.

**Arguments against redistributive taxation**

- Government shouldn’t interfere with people unless they are doing something wrong.
- The economic transactions that produce inequalities are innocent.
- Society is not obliged to fix inequalities because “that’s just life.”
- The only time we have to do anything about it is when the misfortune is the result of someone’s doing a wrong to someone else.

**Thomas Nagel’s position**

- Both luck and deliberately imposed inequalities are unfair.
- We need redistributive taxation and social welfare programs.

**The problem in world scale**

- Much more difficult.
- The inequalities are so great.
- It’s not clear what remedies are possible in the absence of a world government.
- The world government will be horrible in many ways.
- The problem of global justice will remain but solving it in the system of separate sovereign states will be difficult.

# 9. Death

**Is it impossible to contemplate about one’s own death?**

- No.
- Of course, no one can conceive of his own nonexistence.
- But this does not mean that we can’t believe that our existence will come to an end with our deaths.
- We can “imagine” ourself dead from the outside, and doing so does not mean that the “dead” is conscious.

The question of survival after death is related to the mind-body problem.

**Dualist perspective on life after death**

- The soul could exist on its own and have a mental life without the help of the body.
- It could leave the body when the body dies instead of being destroyed.
- No more mental life, sensory perception that depended on the body (unless it attaches itself to a new body).
- It can still have a different sort of inner life (ex: direct communication with other souls)

**Challenges to the dualist perspective**

- Even if dualism is true, consciousness might depend entirely on the support and stimulation it gets from the body.
- The soul might not be able to switch bodies.

**Physicalist perspective on life after death**

- There is no life after death
- Mental processes are dependent on the brain.
- Physical death means mental death
- Life after death will mean the complete revival of the physical body.
- But even if this is successful, the inner state may already be different

**Thomas Nagel’s position**

- Ordinary observation is enough to convince us that there is no life after death.
- Conscious life depends entirely on what happens in our nervous system
- Some people will take a neutral position
- Some people will believe on an afterlife even without evidence.

**Problem: Is your death a good thing or a bad thing?**

- It depends on what death is. If there is life after death, death might not be so grim.
- But if death = the end, how?

**Answers to whether nonexistence is good or bad**

- Neutral. Nonexistence being nothing at all, can’t possible be either good or bad for the dead person.
- Bad. To be annihilated, to have the possible future course of your life cut off completely, is the ultimate evil, even if we all have to face it.
- Good. Death is a blessing when it comes eventually because it would be unbearably boring to live forever.

If death (without an after life) is either good or bad for the person who dies, it must be a negative good or evil.

Death is nothing.

So death, by itself, can’t be either pleasant or unpleasant.

The person who used to exist has been benefited or harmed by death.

**Death is a negative evil**

- When you die, all the good things in your life come to a stop.
- The absence of good things is evil.

**Past versus future nonexistence**

- We all accept the fact that there was a time before we were born, when we didn't yet exist–so why should we be so disturbed at the prospect of nonexistence after our death?

**Regret versus fear of dying**

- It’s easy to understand why people feel regret when death happens: there could have been more life.
- Fear of death is puzzling.

**Logical reason on why not to fear death**

- If we really cease to exist at death, there's nothing to look forward to, so how can there be anything to be afraid of?
- Death should be something to be afraid of only if we will survive it.

# 10. The Meaning of Life

**Argument: Nothing matters because nothing is permanent.**

Answer

- We can’t be immortal.
- But we can find meaning in what we do by looking for it within our own lives.

**Argument: There are justifications for the things that we do. But there is no point of our life as a whole.**

Answer

- Does it matter that it doesn’t matter?

**The problem of the meaning of life**

- There seems to be meaning embedded in small things that we do.
- But their meaning is not enough.
- Does one’s life as a whole have any meaning?
- For it to have a meaning, it has to be part of something larger.
- But, what is the meaning of the larger thing?
- If yes, repeat the question.
- I no, we reach the conclusion that their is no point after all.

**Questions**

- If pointlessness is acceptable for the larger thing of which our life is a part, why shouldn’t it be acceptable already for our life taken as a whole?
- Why isn’t it all right for your life to be pointless?
- If it isn’t acceptable for your life to be pointless, why is it acceptable in the larger context in which your life is a part of?

**Why the question of meaning could not stop with God or any thing that is its own point**

- What kind of answer would bring all of our "Why?" questions to a stop, once and for all? And if they can stop there, why couldn't they have stopped earlier?”
- Can there really be something which gives point to everything else by encompassing it, but which couldn't have, or need, any point itself? Something whose point can't be questioned from outside because there is no outside?
- The “ultimate explanation” may be an incomprehensible answer to a question that we can’t get rid of.

**Life is meaningless and absurd**

- The truth might be that there is no point.
- Some people accept this and just go on survival mode.
- Some people can’t accept this and want what they do to matter.
