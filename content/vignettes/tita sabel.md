The highlight of my day was meeting Tita Sabel as a conscious adult. Imagine the years that had to pass before this little reunion—30 years—a reunion I would've wanted to be different had it not for the language barrier. She is a Deaf but isn't versed in sign language. I would've wanted to ask her question, to get to know her, to have a glimpse of all those 30 years that passed. Because even if I don't have a single memory of her, I trust my mother's stories of how this woman, shunned by the outside world because of her disability, never married and lives with her family all her life (she's now in her 60s), used to protect me with everything she had, used to treat me like her own blood.

My mom said that when I was sleeping as a one-year old child on my crib, my ate, a two-year-old, would play around me and make loud noises. Tita Sabel would get really mad at her. My sister would retaliate, calling poor Tita Sabel "pangit." When she was asked by my mom to leave because she was getting sicker  and sicker (weak lungs), she hugged me and kissed me goodbye like a real mother would do, tightly. She would never see me again after 30 years. She was my last yaya.

It's a shame I never experienced it, never regitered in my memory. But subconsciously perhaps, or in my body, I want to believe that my body remembers that brief period of affection when I was shown love by a complete stranger, something I know will probably never happen again in my adult life.
