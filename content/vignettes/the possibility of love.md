Yesterday, as I was walking back from sampling more of the IRB road, realizing it was difficult to walk on it, I saw this crowd of children and other groups sitting on the side of the road over the short concrete wall that UPLB built around its fields along Pili Drive. The group of children was joined by a bigger adolescent whom I recognized. He was one of the fishball vendors at Grove, which I frequent in the afternoon before or after my walks. This young man has a crooked pinky finger, which he tries to hide sometimes. He was often shy, especially around ladies. But today, I saw him laughing, toying around the kids. He recognized me and was the first to nod his head to greet me. I nodded back. I walked passed them alongside two ladies walking, taking their time.

On the fields, I saw that a group of boys has entered the concrete wall and are walking on that wide grassy dirt road that tractors use. The boys were exploring the fields, something I've been wanting to do. I remember Sta. Maria. I stopped beside the gate to the walkway and sat there when the thought came to me.

For the longest time, I've withdrawn from crowds. Earlier on this walk I even wrote on my phone: "Philippine society is too noisy both in person and online you need to tear yourself from it to hear yourself." But in the morning, I was listening to Steve Patterson's reading of an article he released this year on platonism and I was meditating on it while walking, jotting down notes about how relationships are abstract phenomena that are instantiated by human action to be near objects and humans. And as the sound of children playing, enjoying this dry afternoon in July, filled my background, I suddenly found affinity with the public. I may not always enjoy them but I belong with them by virtue of being near them.

Constant contact make relationships inevitable and I couldn't escape this. My relationship with myself and with place can only go as far as what my relationship with the public allows. My method is walking, ideally in nature. But without me participating in public affairs, I won't be able to influence how nature and walking might be protected. Suddenly, I am considering my relationship with othersâ€”with society, with the crowd of strangers I walk with everyday or the nameless faces that I share spaces with. And, for the first time in a very long time, I considered the possibility of love.
