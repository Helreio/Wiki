The essence of my music tastes can be boiled down to two categories: electronic, and "anything-playing-in-the-background-of-a-YouTube-video". There are, of course, exceptions to this.

This playlist only contains full albums I enjoy, both because it's a nice arbitrary cutting-off point, and also because purchasing albums is the best way to support your favourite artists :)
