## Metalearning

1. Why am I learning what I am learning?
2. What knowledge and abilities do I need to acquire?
3. How am I going to acquire the knowledge and abilities I need?

### Why am I learning what I am learning?

My ultimate goal for improving my editing and proofreading skills is to land a spot in the roster of at least two editing agency platforms, which will provide me with a consistent and resilient flow of income ideally around April and May. 

### What knowledge and abilities do I need to acquire?

[[Concepts, Facts, and Procedures in Editing and Proofreading]]

Editing is a dance between adhering to rules and determining when and how to break them.

If I will opt for membership, I'll join ACES for $75 then buy Poynter training for $99.

==One way to approach this curriculum development is to identify the best agency platforms I could end up to and research the kinds of services they offer and then work on developing those skills.
