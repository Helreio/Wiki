Objectives

- To make meaningful work.
- To find at least two people I can hold reading groups with on philosophy.
- To connect with like-minded people on social media, Internet forums, etc. both people doing independent work and those affiliated with an institution.
- To establish a daily habit of nurturing weak ties with the people I meet online.

Remember that the goal is to build a friendship with wisdom; not fame. The quality of my philosophical relationships is more important that their quantity.
