# What to do with Rem's sites

Rem has 11 wordpress sites under the account with the email rmtanauan@hotmail.com.

1. Ginhawa sampler site
2. Ipabasa
3. Sample service
4. Peregrinations Within
5. Rem Tanauan
6. Story Commune
7. Story Sharing Design
8. The Corporate Misfit
9. Pathfinder's Commune
10. Iching.ph
11. Tungko ng Tula

## A. On the free sites

Sites 1-8 are free sites. I have already backed up all of them except Story Commune which has no content at all. Since their content is backed up, they can be repurposed if needed. The decision to be made for them is what to do with them.

The following seems to have been unlaunched and unfinished projects or experimental sites. They only have a few pages and almost no posts.

- Ginhawa sampler site
- Ipabasa
- Sample service
- Rem Tanauan
- Story Commune (totally no content)
- Story Sharing Design

Meanwhile, the following projects seem to have been launched but were abandoned for a long time already.

- Peregrinations Within (abandoned since 2014)
- The Corporate Misfit (abandoned since 2015)

Peregrinations Within (travel blog) only has four posts. The Corporate Misfit doesn't seem to be Rem's blog. Its author is Irish Movido. But for some reason, it is within Rem's account. It has several posts from 2014-2015.

All sites were abandoned and are no longer attracting new visitors. In short, they are not doing anything to advance Rem's work and legacy. With this in mind, what should be done with them?

**Options**

1. Keep all. Nothing changes. Since they are free, you won't incur any expenses. But, like I said, they don't have any real function other than reminder's of Rem's digital footprints.
2. Delete all. Since they are all already backed up, you have all the content in case you want to repurpose them. Deleting them will declutter Rem's digital footprint. (In case of The Corporate Misfit of Irish Movido, we can give her a backup of her site in case she wants a copy.)
3. Delete all but republish the best posts into a new live site (like the proposed RemTanauan.com). For example, the blog posts in Peregrinations Within can be republished as samples of Rem's travel writings.

**My suggestion**

I suggest option 3. Deleting the unfinished and abandoned sites ensures that we can repurpose or even completely reuse the content in better websites we will build. It will make maintaining Rem's sites easier and will make Rem's brand cleaner.

## B. Paid sites

The following sites have current active plans that will be renewed and incur money unless we intervene.

- Pathfinder's Commune
- Iching.ph
- Tungko ng Tula

### Pathfinder's Commune

PC will auto-renew on April 26, 2023. So we still have around 6 months to decide what to do with it. When renewed, it will incur USD 18 (about Php 1,000 ) per year.

### Iching.ph

Iching.ph will auto-renew on September 18, 2023. So we still have about 11 months to decide what to do with it. When renewed, it will incur Php 2,400 per year.

It is still attracting visitors. Therefore, it can still potentially be a platform to continue Rem's vision and legacy particularly in I Ching.

What will we do with it?

Options
1. Keep it. And do not change anything. You will continue to host the site in Wordpress.com. You will continue to pay Php 2,400 per year and the site will not be updated. Its traffic and permalinks will be preserved. It will serve as an artifact of Rem's work but could continue to serve as a valuable resource for people interested in I Ching. This is the easiest option as we will do almost nothing other than simply pay to keep the site running.
2. Keep it. But make some changes. Like option one, the site stays in Wordpress.com and will cost the same amount (Php 2,400). It preserves the site's traffic and permalinks. But we can update the site to repurpose it. That said, since it is hosted in Wordpress.com, there will be limits in its design and development. This is an easy option too with the only added work of someone updating the site regularly.
3. Keep it. Make changes. And self-host it in Wordpress.org. This gives us more freedom to design and develop it but it will cost more. We will transfer the domain name to a new registrar (might cost about Php 1000+). Then we purchase hosting plan (about Php 6,000 for 3 years). To save on hosting, we could host it in the same account that Tungko ng Tula uses. Since it uses Wordpress, the site can be maintained by more people in a relatively easier manner.
4. Keep it. Make changes. And self-host it as a static site in Github. This gives us more freedom to design and develop it. We will still pay about Php 1000+ to transfer the domain and will continue to pay this every year, but hosting is free. Using this method, we can also incorporate Rem's I Ching notes from his Obsidian to add more resources to learning I Ching. That said, this method requires more coding skills so we need to train others who will help maintain the site.
5. Keep the IChing.ph domain but transfer the content of the site to RemTanauan.com. In this option, we transfer the domain to a new registrar and just hold it there until someone (a student of Rem) would like to claim it. All the contents of the site will then be repurposed to RemTanauan.com. The problem with this method is that it could potentially lose some traffic the the site has built and the permalinks can be destoryed. To avoid this, we will have to do some permalink redirections, which might require a lot of work.
6. Let go of the domain name but transfer the content of the site to RemTanauan.com. Same as Option 5, only that you lose the domain name completely.

**My suggestion**

As much as I would like to incorporate Rem's I Ching writings in his main site RemTanauan.com, I want to preserve the permalinks and traffic he has already built. Because that will ensure that his work will continue to be useful for others. My suggestion is to keep the domain name and to continue to use it to house Rem's I Ching legacy.

However, we have to decide what to do with the site while the plan is active until September 2023 and after that. My suggestion is to assign someone who is deeply interested in Rem's work with I Ching and let him/her manage and update the site, collating everything Rem has written on I Ching into it. Depending on his/her technological skills, she can either manage it in Wordpress.com, Wordpress.org, or Github.

If he/she decides to host it in Wordpress.org, we tranfer the site to the same hosting account as Tungko ng Tula for easier managing. The decision has to be made who pays for the hosting and domain name: the person who maintains or Rem's legacy fund?

(Note: Now that I am thinking about it, we might really need to raise funds to maintain Rem's websites for years to come.)
