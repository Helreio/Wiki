## My Vision

I have established a resilient livelihood system with multiple income streams that provide me at least 40k per month through work that feels good and which supports and encourages me as I transition toward doing work that brings me joy. Currently, my primary source of income is a day job I love. But, I am slowly building a passion business that will eventually replace this day job. Aside from this, I am helping Lea manage and improve her biz, which provides additional income.

I spend most of my days engaged in activities that are most important to me: writing, philosophizing, contemplating, walking, photography, and poetry. I enjoy ample creative freedom because my finances are secure and intact. 

Because of this security and abundance, I finally launched a book project about walking at Los Baños. I did a seven-day walk which I documented through a newsletter series. The material I collected from that walk is what I am now turning into a book. I am on the project's finishing touches, and I look forward to launching it in the first quarter of next year. Its launch is made possible because of a successful crowdfunding campaign. I have exceeded my goal of funding the publication of at least 100 copies and the earnings I will get from these orders will be able to fund the next book project.

The book project mustered my confidence and motivation to seriously improve my web design and development, photography, writing, and connecting skills. I am now quite adept in understanding design principles, and I have applied that understanding in designing a digital garden website that houses all the shareable artifacts of my creativity according to how I want them to appear and be organized. I have mastered using the Canon Mark II and have improved my capturing and editing skills. Daily practice, courses, and feedback have also improved my writing. Through the book project, I have learned how to approach people, ask for guidance, and interview or greet strangers in my walks.

I have also connected with mentors doing work I wanted to do. I have interviewed them about their stories. Through their help, I gained clarity on my life design. They have also provided me with valuable resources and have connected me with other mentors and peers who help me with my dreams and goals. Some of these people have been close friends who I slowly welcome into my inner circle. I regularly converse with self-directed and autonomous creatives, thinkers, and contemplatives deeply grounded in their aspirations to live a good life and share their stories beautifully. I have established a regular habit of searching and reaching out to these people regularly.

I can achieve all these in no small part because I have cared for myself. I have followed a daily routine that encourages good writing and thinking. I sleep eight hours a day, keep my intermittent fasting routine, and have only one heavy meal a day (lunch). I only eat smoothies at night. I have reduced my sugar and carbs intake and increased my diet's veggies, fruits, and fermented foods. I also have regular days of exercise every week and can manage my stress well through mindfulness and contemplative practices like walking. I learned to avoid stressors as much as possible and live a relaxed and calm life. I have improved my self-confidence by only wearing clothes that make me feel good about myself. And most importantly, I live in a home and environment that encourages contemplation and creativity. I could also start tapering my antidepressant to 1/4 a pill daily.
