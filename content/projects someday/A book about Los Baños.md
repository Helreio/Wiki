# Ideas

- Walk predetermined routes that cover all major walking areas in Los Baños in seven days.
- Walk, take photos, and talk to strangers in the morning and afternoon then write, edit photos, and publish missives in the evening.
- The walk should happen within January to March.
- Discover new eskinitas or kalyehons.
- Consider doing a crowdfunding campaign.
- Ask a friend about UP's renting process for teachers etc. (Maybe Kate?)
- For the book, use Thoreau's way: universal then local then individual
	- Who would have thought that I would be in LB at this time?
	- Existential description.
	- Then describe LB.
	- Then describe this specific part of the walk.
	- My walk is befriending life and place and finding home.
- My book is a map of Los Baños in story form.
- Walking as world building and worldview building; physical space influences mental space; what comes out is a life

# Words

These walks are meant to be rewalked.
These words are maps of these places in story-form.
When words are not enough, images take their place.

How about Makiling Botanics?

# Method
- Read natural history of the place.
- Read local history of the palce.
- Walk: Be present, take photos, philosophize, and converse when the right opportunity comes; follow the rules of the walk

Perhaps Marvin was right. Let the data dictate how the book will be.
Instead of exact geolocation coordinates, just say Pili Drive or the name of the street or place. Remember Elio's essay.

# Rules of the walk

- I need to be alone.
- Choose a short book readable in one week, divide the book in seven parts, and read one part in the evening before the walk.
- Start in the morning and could extend in the afternoon.
- Take at least one portrait photo.
- Talk to at least one stranger.
- Record binaural audio.
- Record one video.
- Write and publish a missive in the evening including some edited photos.

# To dos

- Research: Who is Janges?
- Read history of UPLB book.
- Research: What are the different ways to frame a walking book? Perform a review of literature.
