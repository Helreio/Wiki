1. Identify what kind of person you are looking for. See [[thoughts/my ideal mentors and peers]]
2. Identify a person you want to start with, to copy. Ideally contemporary, still living. A philosopher but who also writes poems and does photography and has a religious element in his/her work and grapples with the question how to live.
3. Don't worry about purpose. Embrace a minimalist

To improve my writing life, I need to work on three things:
1. Writing
2. Reading
3. Community

[[My writing life inventory]]

## Writing

- [[The writing I do in private is my most important writing]]. This includes journaling, note-writing in my [[Talahardin]], writing field notes, and the writing I do during [[Review]].
- I prioritize content over style ([[Thoreau prioritized content over style in his writing]]). [[The technicalities of your craft could cloud your real purpose]]. I don't want that to happen in my writing. I want to focus on the search for truth, and I don't want to force insight ([[Insight cannot be predetermined]]). This implies that I will intentionally choose to lessen my publication, perhaps to just once or twice a month (one Lilim and one Uman or just one Uman alone). This will allow me to focus on improving my journal entries, Talahardin, and field notes.
- Avoid making premature conclusions in your public writing. If you are not yet sure about what certain things mean to you or what course of action to take, say it honestly. Do not feel pressure to produce and write answers when the answers are just not there. Writing with an emphasis on process rather than product, which necessitates lesser publication, should solve this.
- I still want to write romantic excursions. However, I want intimate philosophy to be my primary lens. I need to reevaluate the kind of walks I want to take as they relate to the kind of writing and books I want to produce.
- Improve my sleep.
- Improve my diet.
- Continue practicing submitting works to different publications.
