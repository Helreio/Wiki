This business idea has been validated by:
- people expressing interest in it
- people reaching out to me and saying how they find it helpful
- having at least one person willing to pay for it

Create a poll. Say that you plan to offer a workshop on life management system for 500-1000 if at least 10 people comments below.

How do I brand it? Will I continue to use the metaphor of walking, forest garden, etc.? Or do I make it plain and businessy?
- A lot of people are doing LMS stuff. People are attracted to these offers because of their own personality. I want my personality to be reflected in my course.
- Something like ancient wisdom + modern productivity?
- I want my course to be friendly to all temperaments. I want to cater the go getters and overproductive individuals and those that just want a little sense of control. This is why I want to focus on intentionality.
- Intentionality lives in a spectrum between a full-blown LMS and a siple todo list.

Content
- The course will provide tools availabel then a process to use those tools to build. The capstone project is for the person to build a personal LMS.

How do I connect all the other things I want to do?
- All the other things I want to do are my context of use.

But before I can proceed with this, I need to establish my livelihood system
