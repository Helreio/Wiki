- [[building a minimum viable lms program]]

Goal

I have designed and set up a customized minimum viable life management system for Lea. I have assisted her in implementing it, gathered feedback from her use of it, and redesigned it based on these feedback.

Measurements of success
1. LMS
	1. Lea should have freed up time and mental space that she can dedicate for other endeavors.
	2. Lea should be able to engage in a specific task with as much focus as possible.
	3. Lea should have articulated her goals, created a plan for achieving those goals, and reviewed their results diligently for feedback.
2. OBMS
	1. Lea should have freed up time and mental space that she can use to accomodate at least one more premium client.
	2. Lea should have a system in place to scout, hire, and train at least one additional hand to help her in doing her work.

## Lea's current implementation of an LMS

- She already has a capturing habit established.
- She captures most of her ideas and todos in her analog journal and Google Keep.
- She uses Todoist only when she needs to buy stuff in the grocery.
- When overwhelmed with the amount of information and todos, she turns to her jounal, does a brain dump, and write a todo list there.
- She subscribes to a lot of newsletters but does not process them (i.e., does not open them). When she needs inspiration, she searches for emails. (Solution: Set a filter that directs newsletter emails to a specific label so they don't cloud her inbox.)


To dos

LMS

1. Set up a MV LMS prototype.
2. Coach her in establishing and implementing the daily, weekly, and monthly habits and routines needed to keep the LMS running.
3. Collect regular feedback (at least weekly) from her implementation of the system.
4. Use the feedback to make major and minor changes to the design.
5. Support her for at least six months to one year until she can stand on her own.

OBMS

The OBMS will follow the same steps. In fact, it will be integrated (although, later) in the LMS. It will be considered as a new project. Systems can be established but the habits to run the system should only come later.

Projects
- Purging digital spaces
- Transitioning to new laptop
- Setting up a back up system
- Set up a digital privacy and protection system

- Youtube channel
- Backdrop
- Business registration
- Habits
- Systems
- Hiring

1-2 months run systems then decide whether we can build a team or hire new client

Some realizations

- If I am going to offer this as a service, there has to be an option to hire me as a retainer at least for 6 months to one year.
