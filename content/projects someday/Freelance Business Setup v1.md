There is one purpose, or a convergence tool. It could be my purpose or my vision or mission. Everything I do, from livelihood to purel creative project could be strategically aligned with that purpose.

How can I align my skills with that purpose?

Skills
- Proofreading
- Editing
- Teaching
- Coaching
- Strategizing
- Building systems
- Establishing habits

I want to let go of editing and proofreading for the sake of adhering to rules. I want to focus on helping improve text based on the writer's alignment with it. I want to focus on helping the creative and the contemplative align himself with his vision. Obviously I could do this by my example. But that is not the only way there. If this is my goal, I need to explore all avenues toward that.

I want to combine writing with living a good life with thinking about deep stuff and building systems to help all of these happen.

I help writers (writers or creatives) build sustainable writing practices that supports a well-lived life and a thriving business through holistic systems, coaching, and editing.

Hi friends!

I have been working as an editor for different agencies for the past seven+ years now. Now, I am thinking about focusing on offering my expertise independently.

If you have an essay, research paper, resume, or even a book manuscript that you need help with, contact me.

Editor and writer specializing in social sciences, education, spirituality, and religion

Writer and Editor of nonfiction essays, books, and digital content, specializing in personal narratives

Organizations I want to work with

On Being
Fetzer Institute
Kalliopeia
Osprey Foundation
Lilly Endowment
The Hearthland Foundation
George Family Foundation

Ideally, there is no compartmentalization between people you want to work with and people you want to be friends with. If you truly want alignment and satisfaction at work, aspire for alignment.

Getting platform work and upwork work and taking on available gigs only means you need them temporarily.

But always be working towarda serving your people. Providing them with your best skill now then slowly work towards developing other skills so that you could help them further or you could do work you enjoy more while working with them.

They should be the destination you stir towards:

Writing beautiful books and book-shaped writing that inspire people to live intentionally.

You already know who you want to be working with. Intend to work with them now. Some of them will need editing and content writing.

How to build confidence
- create portfolio
- Update resume and CV
- List all your wins
- Improve your website
- Study a course
- Find a community
- Find a mentor

Also I need to put my ideal life and ideal work in front of me. The vision has to be clear so that no matter how hard this current situation is, it still makes sense. It becomes part of it all.

Describe where you ultimately want to end. Find creative ways to align what you currently have with what you want to achieve.
