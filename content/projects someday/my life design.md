### What do I want?

I want to live a life where I am able to pursue creative projects and contemplative endeavors with as much freedom as I can get (i.e., do things at my own time and pace and without being pressured to make money, make decisions I am not ready to do, or answer to anyone, especially shit people).

## Other ideas

Transfer to Pangasina after around a year or after marrying Lea.

Learn building a mud house and build one.
