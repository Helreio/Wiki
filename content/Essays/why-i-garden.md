## Short answer: fun.

I don't get to write stream-of-consciousness in my day-to-day, or to document arbitrary technical problems and how I've solved them. This is a fun place for that outlet.

## Long Answer

There are a lot of beautiful rabbit holes on the internet if you know where to look. Wikis for arbitrary fandoms, project websites, blogs, the like. I'd like to be one of those, or at least a starting point for someone to find a rabbit hole.

The kind of experience I want to be a part of has some basis in the early internet. There was a vocal minority pushing for this sort of unguided exploration, supplemented only by signposts of where one *could* travel from a given page, instead of where one *should* travel [[#1.|(1)]].
