1. First, Open the **[[Project Zomboid|Project Zomboid]] Online Map** on a separate browser.
2. Second, Navigate to and Press **Map Coordinates**, this will be the lowest option on the Left Menu
3. Next, Press **Lock Coordinates**, and Select the point you want to be your Spawn Point.
4. You should be able to recognize this point via a **Green Marker** that should be placed on the Map.
5. **Copy the Coordinates** for the location that you selected as your Spawn Point
6. We urge that you ignore the **Cell and Rel values** while copying the Coordinates for the location
7. Open your **In-game Server Settings**
8. **Select and Open** the Spawn Regions Category, this should be the sixth option from the top.
9. Change the 0,0,0 value to the coordinates of your desired spawn location.
10. For example, if your coordinates are “9667×8775”, the value you type in should be “9667,8775,0”

The **Zero or 0** at the end of the coordinates is indicative of the height at which your character will spawn. Make sure that you do not remove this or tamper with it too much. This is because the value 0 is representative of the **Ground Level**. Whereas 1 is representative of **Second Floor** height, etc.

We recommend changing these values only in the case of wanting to spawn inside of a house. Otherwise, leave the last number on your coordinates at 0, so you spawn properly at Ground Level.
