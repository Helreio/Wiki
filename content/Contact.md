## Email

The best way to get in touch with me is by my email, which is `jahinzee[at]duck.com`[^1]. I usually check my inbox somewhat frequently between `10:00` and `21:00` (Australia/Sydney time).

My email is also the best point of contact regarding any comments or queries about this website.

## Mastodon

You can catch me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.online/@jahinzee), where I make semi-frequent posts on what I'm up to.

## Elsewhere

I also have other social media profiles, although I rarely check them. Please don't private message me on these platforms.
