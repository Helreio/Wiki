I recently started looking into the ideology behind the fediverse. Long story short, I like what I see, and will be looking into a project with it soon.

I started my journey on [fedi.tips](https://fedi.tips/). This is a huge site with mountains of content explaining the fediverse and troubleshooting various hosting/usage issues. The videos linked are really cool.

## The Ideas
### Decentralization
Normally, when I hear "decentralized", my brain goes **straight** to the last tech scam, a la Web3 and cryptocurrency. I always found myself wishing, "why doesn't someone take the really cool principles embodied by crypto and completely divorce them from crypto?" Well, that's what the fediverse seeks to do.
