title: "Notes on Projects I Want to Exist"
---

Basically, this is a collection of notes on projects I think about and feel should exist or on things I want to explicitly use myself, but don't have the personal time to create myself.

It provides me a space to keep things that are publicly available and searchable such that I can continue to develop and remember the ideas I randomly have, and (hopefully) provide a springboard of ideas for others that I can reference and link to. 

I would of course ask that if someone has additions, questions, or criticisms of these project ideas that they make a PR or [contact me](/contact.md) about them so that I can update them here and give appropriate credit for it.

If someone takes an idea and runs with it, successfully implementing it, I hope they tell me and at least give me a shoutout for the idea. That would be great and certainly what I would do if I did such a thing. 

If you're reading, Enjoy!
