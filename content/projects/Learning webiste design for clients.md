# Lessons learned from doing web design work

- Do not start work until contact is signed.
- Brand strategy and copy writing services will be priced in front of web design.
- Do staging offline (or somewhere, just not through a plugin).
- Communicate from the very start that you will need their cooperation most esp in providing assets you need.
- Release final website only after paid the full.
