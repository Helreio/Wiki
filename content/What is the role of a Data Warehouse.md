**Q:** I have so much data, how do I make use of it efficiently? 🤔

**A:** Data Warehouse 💡

**Q:** But, what the heck is a Data warehouse and how can it help me?😕

**A:** Let’s say you run a business selling sports goods and accessories. You have multiple stores located all over the world, you have an app, a website, CRM, and few other sources where your data is located. Suddenly your business starts losing customers and sales are decreasing day by day and you want to find the reason why it is happening. You would have to analyze the data present in all the production DBs and that will slow down the speed of the live systems and will have to repeat the same tasks at all the data sources. To solve this problem you can use a Data Warehouse.

A data warehouse is a special type of database system that is used for accumulating and storing data from various sources and enables users to make complex queries about that data. It’s just basically a nice one shop stop for all your information requirements.

**Role of a Datawarehouse**👨‍🔧

1. Analysis and Predictions: Using a data warehouse, one can look at past trends, whether they be product sales or customers or whatever, and maybe do some predictions of what is going to happen in the future. These predictions and analyses are extremely useful while making business decisions.
2. Functionalities: DW has a lot of additional features like Data Integration, Import & export DBs, Data Cleaning, Scheduling, Managing backup and disaster recovery, Security, etc.
3. Data consolidation: Stores all the data in one place from all the different sources and departments, such as email, accounting, customer service, historical data, etc.
4. Data consistency: Data warehouses are programmed to apply a uniform schema to all collected data, which makes it easier for doing analysis and share insights with the team.
5. Speed: The DW can serve up lots of data faster for reporting or analysis. It executes complex and big queries quickly since it is faster to read the data.

**Conclusion:** A data warehouse is a concept for collecting and storing data in a way that is optimal for human readability, data integration, performing analysis, and creating business reporting.
