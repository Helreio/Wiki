title: About Me
---
First of all, I am an enthusiast for all things DIY. Mainly, that involves digital projects such as this one.

## By Day
I'm a law student aiming to practice in intellectual property litigation. Massively nerdy stuff.

## By Night
I obsess over minimizing my digital footprint with respect to services where the users are viewed as the product. See my thoughts [[Programs I Like/on-self-hosted-software|on Self-Hosted Software]] for more.

## By...Hobby
I enjoy rock climbing, building & flying FPV drones, reading, and baking.
