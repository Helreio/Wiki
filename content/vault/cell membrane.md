#bio 

hypertonic ::: water rushes out of the cell

hypotonic ::: water go in cell

simple diffusion ::: molecules freely go from high concentration

facilitated diffusion ::: special tubes help molecules go from high to low concentration.

active transport ::: different from diffusion. Low to high concentration.

osmosis ::: simple diffusion of water (so kinda the opposite of simple diffusion for the solutes)
