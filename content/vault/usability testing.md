## notes
Discoverability  - A button should react when you hover over it, and such. The idea is that your user should be able to figure out what they're doing without a manual.

understanding feedback - users should be aware that the thing they did worked.

1. put test users in the mindset of the person that would actually use it.
2. write task questions 
	1. where would you go to pay?
	2. how to you see latest news?

3. create evaluation standards. 
	1. Decide what's a failure for your interface, like whether or not the user clicked the button you wanted them to. 
	2. record body languages, frustrated sighs
4. follow-up questions

Make sure to prime them by just starting conversation. This helps the user tester start talking and think aloud. 
Don't show opinions on what they picked. (like joy or disappointment)
