Ask Connor what he thinks about the habitability of dune. 
Im the book:
The invasion was a surprise. 
Doctors are programmed with the Hippocratic oath. Yueh was fueled by hatred for the harkonnens, that's what for past lady Jessica's lie catching. 
Jessica is a truthsayer. That's the benefit of taking on a bene gesserit as a wife. 
Gurney is more joyous, and plays instruments and cites poetry all the time. 
Baron is a pedo. 
Sardoukar involvement is a secret. 
The suits stop projectiles, and the only projectiles that penetrate cause massive collateral damage. That's why no guns. 
As a thing that helps with future possible plans, bene gesserit have been sending manipulation missionaries with miracles and preaching for millennia. 
There was this super cool dinner scene. 
Grampa Leto was disgusting. Good movie portrayal. 
Baron disgusting. Nice touch. He's also Paul's gramps. 
Leto didn't marry Jessica for political reasons. 
Leto, of the houses, was getting too much political support. The empire has a delicate balance from the houses, only having any power because the houses aren't unified. 
Mental deduction, bene gesserit powers of observation, truthsaying, navigator navigation is all mental ability, organized rigorously, and amplified by spice. Bene gesserit planning made the genetic power that Paul has.

There's way more fremen, and they're way better fighters than the harkonnens can even conceive. 
Presumably, Paul is just knowing all this stuff via observation. 
Paul inherits the dead guys wife and kids.
