another freaking test for convergence/divergence of a series

apparently even $\sum\limits \frac{1}{n}$ converges when it's alternating. Just take out the $(-1)^{n}$.

# procedure
take out the $(-1)^{n}$, and you're left with $b_{n}$, if $\lim_{n->\infty} b_{n} = 0$, and $b_{n+1}\leq b_n$ for all $n$, then the whole series converges.

# absolute vs conditional convergence

# error
