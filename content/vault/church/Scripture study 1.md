So when I first learned about it, the Abraham covenant really seemed like the covenant is redundant to the other ordinances that are talked about. Like, the promises given were what I though we got during baptism, and then during the temple sealing. I just didn't realize that the Abrahamic covenant predates them. I'd like to investigate that some more, like really dedicate some real study to it. At this point, I see it to be essentially the same thing as: keep the commandments and you can have everything. ![[ff5.jpg]]

As far as the bible dictionary entry for *Israel*... Meh. I prefer *he who wrestles with God*. To me that means someone that really understands the purpose of our time here. Like, we need to learn, and God places challenge after challenge before us like a coach or even sometimes a sparring partner. 

Jerusalem: Explains the conflict with Palestine pretty well to be honest.

More like linguistic shift.

I should try to be known as the meekest of men. 

Elijah is definitely the raddest of prophets.
