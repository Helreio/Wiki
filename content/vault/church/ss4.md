Mark 1-11
How can I be like the friends of this sick of the palsy?
- be impertinent, love can be like that sometimes.
- be persistent, faith can be like that sometimes.
- impatience can even be a virtue, given the right circumstances. Like, if the reasons for waiting or procrastinating aren't pure, let my spiritual side be impatient. Let it push until resistance breaks and I can get to the blessings that I needed.

> Mark 2:17 ... Jesus ... saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick

My urgency must be like somebody that is sick and needs healing. 
This sense of intensity is expressed further, when Christ looks around in anger because of the hardness of the heardts around Him. Mark 3:5
It's a sense of energy and great care/emotion about spiritual matters. 
Christ declares that all who do the will of God are His Family. Strong connections, strong emotions. 
Mark 4, talking about the word and candles upon a candlestick, speaks of radical transparency. Nothing held back.
> the seed should spring and grow up

A mustard seed grows up and becoms greater than all herbs.
A great storm, and a great calm. Jesus acts with the vigor of the condemned, but the confidence of someone who knows it'll all turn out right. He knows there are great challenges ahead of us, but that we will succeed. Actually, not all of us will. Maybe that's the uncertainty/problem that drives Him. He loves us, and knows that some will be lost.
Mark 5: It must have been such a relief to be able to save people so easily by casting out devils and diseases and death. If only it were always so easy. 

> a mighty work
thou art the Christ
get behind me, satan

If your foot, hand, or eye offends thee, cut it off. Definitely gives off the vibe of desperate, no, imperative drive towards getting it right. 
God is demanding. Give it all away, cut it off, cut it out, get it behind you, grow and grow, push until you break through the crowds and through the ceiling, leave your house, drink of His cup. but be as a little child
