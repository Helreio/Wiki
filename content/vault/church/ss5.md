1 Tim 1:4 - I relate so much. Endless geneologies are meaningless to me, and I have yet to feel the spririt of Elijah. Legitimately, though, it's totally fair that there were likely to be plenty of people who were over-emphasizing geneology. You can't be saved by it. Yet, there's a certain legitimacy that is provided when Christ's geneology is lined out in the gospels. He's not only a miracle worker, and doesn't only claim to be who He is. It's all also backed up by history and the prophecies.

I appreciate the effort Mark put into making the story of Jesus so explainable. He went ahead and explained cultural norms and context, and clearly cared about our understanding.

The existence of the wise men is absolutely fascinating. They likely weren't astrologers, but probably holy men. They may not have even been jews. It speaks of how people of a completely different system, culture, belief, and general reality can also be right, and see the truth far before you. In many little things, other people can be decades ahead of you.

There's also a ton of legitimacy layed out [here](https://rsc.byu.edu/how-new-testament-came-be/first-century-sources-life-jesus). Jesus Christ totally happened, and it's all backed up by historical record. Strong evidences are no foundation for true faith, but it sure doesn't hurt. 
 
 My favorite scripture is in matthew 6. at the very end. It's such a peaceful message. Like, it guides the mind towards what needs to be done right. now. All else is unnecessary, because God will take care of it. It was important to me on the mission because so much was left to human choice and thus generated a ton of uncertainty. There was no way to predict and properly plan for the future without busting my brain trying to simulate every scenario.
