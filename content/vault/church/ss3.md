fits the theme of adversity deepening spirituality.

> The period of the captivity had a lasting effect upon the Jewish people. It put a stop to the old sin of idolatry; it was a time of great spiritual revival (Ezek. 36:24â€“28), a number of the Psalms being written during this period; and it led to a deepening reverence for the law of Moses, especially that part of it dealing with ritual observance.

This is especially cool, since it begins to tie together various works. God really did have everybody in mind when he commanded ancient prophets to write what they did. I appreciate it, because it means that I can read anything that was written knowing that it will improve how I interpret the scriptures.
 > The reader today has no greater written commentary and guide to understanding Isaiah than the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants. As one understands these works better he will understand Isaiah better, and as one understands Isaiah better, he more fully comprehends the mission of the Savior and the meaning of the covenant that was placed upon Abraham and his seed by which all the families of the earth would be blessed.


This verse is beautiful. It speaks of redemption. Very Christlike themes. The valley of death can be pulled out of context and inform just about any life condition, be it depression or conflict or poverty or a period of high stress. 
> 2 The people that walked in [darkness](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/9?lang=eng#note2a) have seen a great [light](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/9?lang=eng#note2b): they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.

Yep, after that verse, Christ is definitely prophesied about. He's spoken about as a great and powerful ruler.

improvement! They are going to rebuild everything, only better! More redemption and resurrection and eternal progress themes!

Of course, that's balanced by a later condemnation of sin. There will also be a lot of bad stuff going down for the wicked. Humility and righteousness is essential, or else great calamity will befall you. Perhaps the context reveals that this was specific to a historical event that happened, but the scripture as it applies to me links God's blessings to an inevitable consequence should I fail to follow the rules.
> For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
