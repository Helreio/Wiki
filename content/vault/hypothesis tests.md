You have a hypothesis that you want to prove or disprove. Put on it the burden of proof, by assuming it to be in debate until some base case, the Null Hypothesis, is sufficiently disputed. Then you make the hypothesis you're curious about the Alternate Hypothesis.
Null Hypothesis :: There's nothing special about the data. like the 'status quo'.
Alternate Hypothesis :: The hypothesis you're actually interested in.
