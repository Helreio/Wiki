Our most durable competitive advantage (vs big companies in tech) is *speed*. 

"You can have it good or you can have it fast" - a dumb and lame quote from lame and dumb people.
The gains you get by pushin speed in your company is that the culture pushes everyone to be faster because seeing those gains is encouraging.

As an engineer, forget forget forget about clean code and making it look perfect. Just make it *technically* work.

If somebody suggests a project and says it's gonna take like 3 months, you should hate it. It should be disgusting and make you physically cringe.

> speed isn't the enemy of quality, it's the only way to acheive it.

I don't totally agree with this, but ok. I guess in a business sense, it's fair, but there's a lot to be said about labors of love, and art.

> What's your reaction when someone says, "Can we go faster?"

Annual roadmaps, quarterly plans are wrong because they set a slow pace.
Dang I really relate to that. 

* find simpler solutions
* solve fewer problems
* narrow your focus
* raise velocity
* why not today?

never be the leader to cause complexity. Instead try to create clarity and simplicity, and it's best to do so via real teammate dynamic, not heirarchy. 

Have a common enemy?? Weird thing to say, sounds kinda machiavellian/orwellian.
