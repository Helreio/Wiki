I am part of a research group investigating the potential that matching a piece of text to the cultural dimensions (hofsteade's) has in improving machine translation. 
I have an existing dataset of Spotify's top 200 songs weekly in Brazil and the US throughout the past few years, with lyrics pulled from Genius. I'm in the process of getting permission to use the data from Genius, but frankly, it's not very high quality. 
Your data seems likely to be better! I'll be getting cleaner data with your api, I there's already (albeit only current) charts information, and we can potentially get translations, as well! I'm getting started with your free api, but we really want the full lyrics and perhaps charts and translations. My current charts dataset has 7000 titles. How much would that cost?

 My current charts dataset has 7000 titles. I'd like to know what can potentially be worked out. I can prove that I'm part of an educational institution, I can talk about how we would credit you once having used that data, and I would like to know possible pricing information.
