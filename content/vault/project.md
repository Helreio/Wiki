#math/calculus 


I've been investigating the different resources for the past couple of weeks, but I've settled on simply learning to compute everything that we've been studying so far in class in python. I'm pretty excited about this, since it makes the homework much more personally interesting, and I become a lot more confident in my ability to actually do the problem when I can build a machine to do it. On top of that, sympy (the python framework I'm using) is super flawed when it comes to the problems in class, but it's open source. I'm already passionate about contributing to publicly beneficial projects, and it's extremely rewarding to be able to perform basic QA for it, and perhaps even fix some of the bugs myself.     
     
If I have additional time, I want to pursue an especially unique abandoned feature of the open source whiteboard app that I use to do my homework. Somebody has previously tried to pipe handwritten math to free frameworks for conversion to latex. It's mostly well-made, but the character recognition is just flawed. I recently found a proprietary version that more reliable converts any handwritten math into latex, and sympy has a (sorta buggy) latex parser. I might be able to build a little accuracy checker. This would be a huge project, though. Not realistic for 10 hours. I really only might get the very basic steps put in, but in a public project, it's not totally gone to waste.
