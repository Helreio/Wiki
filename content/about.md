## Hi, I'm Jane

I'm a tech enthusiast and a cat mom of four. Professionally, I work in IT, but I enjoy tech in general.

I tend to get lost in the rabbit hole of building my second brain using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). The intent of this site is to become my digital jungle, and not a formal blog. It's less focused on polishing what I put here, so if you see any dead links, those are probably ideas not cultivated yet, or they link to my private notes inside my vault. 

The majority of the time, the notes are written as if I'm talking to myself.

(Because I am.)

The goal is to put these thoughts out there, look back at them years later, and cringe. Hard.

$~$

> Learn to live alongside cringe. No matter how hard you try to avoid being cringe, you will look back on your life and cringe retrospectively. Cringe is unavoidable over a lifetime. Even the term ‘cringe’ might someday be deemed ‘cringe’.
> 
> -Taylor Swift, NYU speech
