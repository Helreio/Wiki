Lilim is my bi-weekly newsletter on walking. Originally it was a weekly newsletter, but I just couldn't sustain that schedule of production. It is too much product oriented. As of 2022-08-25, Lilim will be "published whenever ready" and shall be integrated with [[Uman]].

I took [[thoughts/craig mod]]'s advice and released Lilim by season. As of 2022, Lilim has three seasons. The first season was a mix of walk vignettes and personal essays. The second season followed a 3-2-1 newsletter style. The third season is mostly walk vignettes.

Moving forward, I would like to write shorter vignettes, like those of [[Ben Hewitt]] (300-400 words, 2-4 paragraphs). This would teach me how to be more succinct and could lessen the load further so I can focus more on my studies.

The vignettes will present a specific moment (microcosm) and then connect it with a more abstract philosophical idea.

I don't want to be at the center of the story, even if I am the protagonist. I simply want to show what i see and from that, elicit thoughts, appreciation, and awe on the reader.
