## Habitasis (GovHack 2023)

*Liveability in numbers.*

Habitasis is an application that allows you to enter your postcode, and see how your suburb stacks up when it comes to liveability, based on housing and transport data

**NOTE:** This project was made as a demonstration for a hackathon, and the current implementation relies on incomplete and limited data sources.

Featured on [The Mandarin](https://www.themandarin.com.au/228238-govhack-hacking-government-data-to-solve-the-cost-of-living-crisis/), and won the *Cost of Living Pressure NSW* category.
