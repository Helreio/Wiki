I've reset my website to be a "digital garden." It's basically just a bunch of linked notes with all of my migrated articles I've written. I use this mostly to just make it so my notes are linkable to other people and sharable / discoverable. Hope you enjoy. If you don't, doesn't really bother me. 

Here are those [posts](/posts).

Here are the [notes](/notes).

Here is a blurb [about me](/about).

Here are my [scientific publications](/pubs).

Not sure? you can search with `ctrl + k`.
