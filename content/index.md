# Welcome!
You're on a site called a [[Misc/what-is-a-garden|Digital Garden]]. Here's some info on [[Essays/why-i-garden|Why I Garden]].

Feel free to subscribe to [this site's RSS feed](/index.xml) for the latest updates whenever I post.

# What can I see here?
I [[about-me|(me, myself)]] write about:
- [[Projects/home|Projects]] I've undertaken
- Technical mishaps I've experienced
- [[Programs I Like/home|Programs that rock]], even if I haven't personally used them
- The intersection of social issues and technology

# What the hell is that spiderweb thing?
That's the [Graph View](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view). It's an [[Programs I Like/obsidian|Obsidian]] feature which acts as a map of the entire site and how it interconnects. It doesn't use Obsidian's implementation directly, but since the site generator I use is heavily inspired by Obsidian and [Obsidian Publish]( https://obsidian.md/publish ), it remains.

# What else do I need to know?
This should be a mostly complete textual site listing in case, like me, you find the aforementioned [[#What the hell is that spiderweb thing?|Graph View]] a bit too un-navigable for practical use.
- [[Projects/home|Projects I've worked on]]
- [[Programs I Like/home|Programs that I like]]
