Repair is dead, and our own economy brought about its downfall. 

The modern web is dominated by closed-source programs. 

Intrusive analytics and the internet of shit are inextricably present in our daily life. 

On my little corner of the internet, I fight back against all of the above by sharing what I know about computers. This is Projects & Privacy. 
# Welcome!
You're on a site called a [[Misc/what-is-a-garden|Digital Garden]]. Here's some info on [[Essays/why-i-garden|Why I Garden]].

This site changes often. Feel free to subscribe to [this site's RSS feed](/index.xml) for a ping every time I make a new entry. You can also check [Updates](/Updates) for a monthly list of changes.
> [!question] What can I see here?
> I [[about-me|(me, myself)]] write about:
> - Projects I've undertaken and programs that I've used
> - The intersection of social issues and technology, often with a privacy-first spin
> - Anything else that you can find in the [Explorer](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/explorer) on your left
>	- If you're on mobile, visit the [[sitemap|Sitemap]].

> [!Question] -> What the hell is that spiderweb thing?
> That's the [Graph View](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view). It's an [[Programs I Like/obsidian|Obsidian]] feature which acts as a map of what pages link to each other. Click on it for a map of the entire site and how it interconnects. It doesn't use Obsidian's implementation directly, but since [[Projects/Obsidian/digital-garden|the site generator I use]] is heavily inspired by Obsidian and [Obsidian Publish]( https://obsidian.md/publish ), it remains.

> [!question] -> What’s a Backlink?
> The Backlinks pane is a list of all pages that link to this site in content. Because you’re on the homepage, it’s empty. On content pages, it’ll be more substantial and serve as a convenient navigation tool.
