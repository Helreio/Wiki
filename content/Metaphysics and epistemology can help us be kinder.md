[[Suffering is avoided by seeing things as they are]]. For example, knowing the truth and seeing the world as it really is could point to large-scale faulty policies that hurt people on a large scale.

Yes, [[thoughts/metaphysics]] can be the source of barbaric debates and hatred. But it can also be the thing that nudges us towards a better direction. [[Amoralism]] demonstrates this.

We still need metaphysics and [[thoughts/epistemology]] to correct our biases and to see people as they really are. But because metaphysics and epistemology can be very divisive ([[We agree about what we want and disagree about metaphysics and epistemology]]), we need to learn [[How to navigate divisive topics]].

To Do

- Provide a detailed discussion on how Richard Garner sees that amoralism can lead to a kinder world.
- Connect Scout Mindset by Galef.
