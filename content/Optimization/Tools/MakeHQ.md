[Integromat](https://Integromat.com/) is the most important automation tool I use. With it, I connect all services that have [[Knowledge/Programming/API]] using either built-in modules or connecting directly through [[Knowledge/Programming/API]] via the HTTP module.

In some cases, I create my own [[Optimization/Automation/Microservices]] to perform tasks that:
- are not feasible with off-the-shelf tools
- expand the capabilities of existing tools

Very often I start automation scenarios with Webhook to run them immediately from [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]] or any [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]] script or automation.
