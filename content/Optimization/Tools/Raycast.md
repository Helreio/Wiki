title: Raycast

Raycast is a launcher that has almost entirely replaced [[Optimization/Tools/Alfred]] and largely replaces [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]].

Its biggest advantage for me is:
- speed
- aesthetically pleasing interface
- An ingenious API for creating extensions in JS / TS / Node.js and the use of AppleScript and Bash.
