# What is Anki?

[Optimization/Tools/Anki]] is an application that facilitates memorization. It is based on the so-called [[Spaced Repetition]], which is repetition at intervals.

## How do I use Anki?

I almost always have the app active either on my phone or computer. Whenever I come across information that I consider worth remembering, I save it as an Anki card.

Every day I flick through a dozen cards for ~20 minutes, thus recalling the suggested cards.
