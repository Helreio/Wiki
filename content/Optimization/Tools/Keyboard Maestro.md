title: Keyboard Maestro
---

[[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]] is an application I use to automate many tasks within the OSX operating system. I use it together with [[Optimization/Tools/Alfred]] and [[Optimization/Hardware/StreamDeck]].

I regularly find myself using [[Knowledge/Programming/JavaScript/JavaScript]] and [[Knowledge/Programming/Node.js]] scripts to create individual actions.

## Individual shares
- Faster system navigation (e.g., switching applications or launching functions)
- Useful notifications (such as [[Pomodoro]] and reminders for daily habits)
- Autosave in programs that do not have this feature
- Assigning keyboard shortcuts to program options that do not allow this (thanks to the [Menu Bar Search](https://github.com/BenziAhamed/Menu-Bar-Search) extension, among others)
- Manage window positioning in a custom way (in conjunction with [[Optimization/Tools/Magnet]])
- Application management (e.g., disabling Messenger after 5 minutes)

## Working with text
