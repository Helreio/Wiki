My name is Jahin (rhymes with "the bin"), and I live somewhere in Sydney. That concludes the amount of sentences I can write about myself, so here are some trivia-style dot points:

- I'm currently studying for my Bachelors in Information Technology at Macquarie University.
- I write small sorta-mundane apps in Python (and occasionally Shell script), some of which can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jahinzee).
- I also know enough Java, Scala, C and JavaScript to bootstrap myself into learning more of them on the job.
- I'm an avid supporter Free and Open Source and [Local-First](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) software.
- I attend a lot of hackathons, with my most recent being GovHack 2023, where our team's projects won state-level and national awards.
	- The project I spent most of my hackathon time is  [a system for assigning livability scores for postcodes](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-elit3/habitasis).
- I've had a deep interest graphics and UI/UX design since I was in primary school â€“ some of my work can be found [[Graphics Showcase|here]].
- I like to take [[Photos|photos]] when I'm out and about, although I very much consider myself a hobbyist in photography.
- I love trainspotting and public transportation in general.
