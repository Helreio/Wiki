##### Ideas:

- make this some sort of book on how to get over many mental illnesses ie. adhd, depression, anxiety, etc. FInd the common characterisitcs and biology behind each condition and how they connect and dont. 
- Might just make this book about the mechanisms and causes and make it just a critique of society. I think including solutions would make or too long and about too many things and should probably be something separate. What the anti psychiatry movement really needs is a central book from which they can evaluate every other book on neuroscience, including the ones about solutions
- Include a reading list at the back or something for solutions
- It will not be a book telling elope to stay away from other books, but actually to encourage them to read them while keeping this book in mind
- Subtitle idea: a reevaluation of our understanding the mind
- I'm not anti mental illness. I think the categories are useful. Nor am I anti medicine, I think medication can help get people out of a certain headspace and get down perspective on there lives
- Mental health stigmas exist because these people do have a predilection for being stubborn, manipulative, or selfish. This doesn't mean we shouldn't feel compassion for them, but it also doesn't mean they shouldn't be heald accountable for their behavior. It's a mutual process
- I believe that our thing if I action of mental illness is the reason why adhd and sleep depreciation are considered different diagnosis as if they involve different neural processes

___

### Writing

- "The destigmatization of mental illness seems like a noble pursuit on the surface. However..."
    - I think destigmatization is usually just embracing weakness because many supposedly immutable mental conditions are really not. Guilting is used to shut people down who critisize. Psychiatry is a moral system
- Then talk about how there is no biomarker for mental illnesses
- Then talk about the potential of overcoming various mental illnesses
- [[Genetic theories of medical or mental conditions can enable people or society to absolve themselves from responsibility]]
