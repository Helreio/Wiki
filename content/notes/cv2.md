# Career Objective
I am open to a role in a wide variety of areas: web development, ML/AI, game development, AR/VR or even Dev-ops. I enjoy solving complex problems and experimenting with new tech. I have dabbled in many fields within computer science.

In year 13 I made a complete mobile application using React Native and expo. Since then, I have made a simple website with plain HTML and JavaScript, and started another React Native expo app. Last year I took a very cool data science paper, and learnt how to use python for ML/AI. I found this paper very interesting and fun. In the following summer, I used what I had learned to turn a GoPro into a motion detection camera.

The first language I learnt when I started programming was C# in year 9. I started by making simple text-based games in the terminal, but soon grew bored and started to experiment with Unity. I stated simple with some 2d games, eventually working up to a 3D top down shooter with procedurally generated maps, which I later transformed into a basic single-player first-person shooter game. 

I often stay up far too late fixating on a stubborn bug or a difficult feature. But the satisfaction I get when I finally solve it, quite often warrants a little dance. These moments are why I enjoy coding so much.
