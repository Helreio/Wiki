# Career Objective
I am open to a role in a wide variety of areas: web development, ML/AI, game development, AR/VR or even Dev-ops. I enjoy solving complex problems and experimenting with new tech. I have dabbled in many fields within computer science.

In year 13 I made a complete mobile application using React Native and expo. Since then, I have made a simple website with plain HTML and JavaScript, and started another React Native expo app. Last year I took a very cool data science paper, and learnt how to use python for ML/AI. I found this paper very interesting and fun. In the following summer, I used what I had learned to turn a GoPro into a motion detection camera.

The first language I learnt when I started programming was C# in year 9. I started by making simple text-based games in the terminal, but soon grew bored and started to experiment with Unity. I stated simple with some 2d games, eventually working up to a 3D top down shooter with procedurally generated maps, which I later transformed into a basic single-player first-person shooter game. 

I often stay up far too late fixating on a stubborn bug or a difficult feature. But the satisfaction I get when I finally solve it, quite often warrants a little dance. These moments are why I enjoy computer science so much.

# Skill Summary
## Problem Solving
Ever since I was a kid, solving problems has been one of my favourite things. I have grown a lot since my days of engineering lego machines and finding creative ways to read at night without my parents knowing. I recently transformed my GoPro into a motion detector and made an app to track my snowboarding progress. These projects were direct solutions to problems I faced often. I wanted to know which member of the family was stealing my cookies, so I made a motion detector. I wanted to have a clear picture of what my snowboarding goals were and what I needed to do to achieve them, so I created an app which helped me do those things. I Iove solving problems. Tell me yours! 

## Independent Learning
To create these solutions, I needed to learn new things. My desire to solve problems, necessitates independent learning. While the things I've learnt at school and in university have been helpful, their real value to me is that they provide a launching pad from which I can expand my knowledge, and dive deeper into technologies I find interesting and exciting, and technologies I can use to solve whatever problem I have.

## Communication
For the past 2 years I have been working part-time for Company-X. My job was to assemble e-learning modules in different languages. This project involved working under a project manager and with multiple teams, spread across the globe. Initially we were a team of four people, but after the first few weeks I working on the project independently. Working with many international teams provided a huge challenge as they did not always have great english speaking skills. This meant I had to communicate very clearly, and make absolutely sure that I correctly understood the client and their requests. Futhermore, I had to manage communication with my project manager, and keep him up-to-date and informed.

- Implemented and experiemented with various algorithms and data structures.

## Python
- Created a Slack bot using Flask which is currently running as an AWS Lambda function
- Transformed my GoPro to a motion detector by streaming video to an RTMP server and analysing the data using OpenCV
- Implemented various machine learning and AI methods using Jupyter notebooks. Used numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib and more

## Web Technologies
- Created a snowboard goals tracking application using Expo and React-Native
- Currently creating a website with user authentication using Express, MongoDB, and Pug, hosted using AWS

Other Languages I have used: C, C#, 6809 Assembly, SQL.

# Project Experience
## Album of the Day Website
[github album website](https://github.com/JetHughes/album)

This is my most recent project. I created this as a way to put in to practive the things I have been learning at university. I is a basic website with user authentication and authorisation. It is built using Express and Pug and is hosted on AWS.

## React Native App
[github react native app](https://github.com/JetHughes/snowboard-goals-app)

This was one of my first large projects. It was my year 13 IT scholarship project. It is built using React-Native and Expo. Throughout the creation of this project I had to consider many factors besides the code. This included working with a stakeholder, considering legal and ethical implications, privacy, security, UI design, Iterative development and more.

## Motion Detector
[github motion detector](https://github.com/JetHughes/motion-detector)

This was a small project I made last summer. Someone was stealing my cookies, so rather than recording 24/7 I configured my GoPro to stream to an RTMP server. This video was then analysed by a python script using OpenCV and I was alerted when motion was detected.

## Python Bots
[github slack bot](https://github.com/JetHughes/discord-album-bot) [github album bot](https://github.com/JetHughes/slack-album-bot)

## Non-Destructive Image Editor
This was a group project for my software development paper last semester. We were provided with the basic skeleton of the app, then we had to add features such as: zoom, image saving, and various image filters such as sharpen, posterise, contrast and brightness and more. We also had to add unit testing, mange communication, set deadlines, allocate tasks, and maintain a repository.

# Interests
- Music: Probably too much - I have listed to about 1072 albums, 820 artists, and 11,395 tracks this year. I also recently started to produce my own music
- Surfing, Snowboarding, and Skating: Grew up in Raglan and living in Dunedin: How can I not?
- Philosophy: Food for the brain - Currently 100 episodes into Philosphize This by Stephen West
- Cooking: Japanese, Mexican, Chinese, Thai, Inidan, Caveman, etc - I love trying new things
- Reading: Currently reading Ouf of the flames by Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone - a book about Michael Servetus's work.
- Frisbee Golf: Just pure relaxing fun.
