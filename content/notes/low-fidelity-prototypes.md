# Inital Designs
## Navigation
The first thing I wanted to was get a clear picture of how each screen should interact with the others. Identified three main screens: Home, Friends, and Schedule. I also identified some supplementary screens: Trick options, other settings, and welcome, and some more optional screens: Trick lists, trick dictionary. 

I also listed some things that each screen should contain

## General protoypes
Next I started to get down down general ideas about all of the screens. The main goal of this step for was to figure out the general flow of the app, and to get a general idea of how each screen should look.

This first two pages I was experimenting mostly with the home screen. I tried three different layouts: Top tabs, Bottom tabs, and floating bottom buttons. I also started to explore ways for the user to navigate from the home screen to the trick options screen, and the schedule screen.

The second page I explored a some variations on the floating button design. And begin  experimenting with the navigation and layout of the friends screen.

On the third page I kept experimenting with the friends page.

# In depth prototypes
## Home screen
I wanted to keep the layout mostly based on googles material design. This will help with four design heuristics: Familiar metaphors and language, consistency and standards, recognition over recall, and minimalist design.  

I started with creating an partly new design that combined the floating buttons, and the swipe feature for trick options. I decided against this as within material design it is not reccomended to have multiple floating buttons. I decided instead to use bottom tabs as they are the most logical, and familiar design for users. 

I also decided against the swipe feature to show tricks, and opted instead for a button which opened another screen.

I also tried out some other designs features a black background and round buttons.

## Trick Options
For the trick Options I considered a few three main designs: the swipe/scroll, the modal, and the full screen.
