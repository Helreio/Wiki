## Overview
I want to build a home dashboard in my kitchen that is a nice touchscreen display of various home automation tasks and cameras I have available. 

## Features
Here are features I'm thinking it needs:
- calendar
    - synced with various google accounts
- live home camera feeds
- light control
- internet bandwidth consumption
- power consumption monitoring
- weather

I have a [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) setup on an rpi4 that doesn't do much yet, but can serve as the main server. 

## Hardware
- 27 in ViewSonic touchscreen (TD2760) (ordered - $500)
    - I wanted a 32 in but apparently they simply don't make monitors at this size. It's either 27 or 42, or a chinese kiosk brand that I'm not sure I want to dive too much in to making sure it works
- rpi 4 (already owned)
- wireless keyboared and mouse (ordered - $30)
