# Java -> UML reverse engineering
reverse of [uml-java-forward-engineering](notes/uml-java-forward-engineering.md)

- parse java doe and egenerate corresponding uml diagrams
- useful to generate models of existing systems

- automated diagram layout likely to be ugly â‡’ manual clean up
- some language specific features may not translate
