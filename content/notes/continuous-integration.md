# Continuous Integration
## 1 What is it
continuous --> is always happening
integration --> connecting software components

inc ontrast to ad hoc, occasional integration:
- diverging component developmetnamy break integration
- repaiing software may be expensive

supports 'aglile' software dev
- like test driven development, help catch issues early

usually automated

## 2 Purposes
- checking code syntax
	- e.g., have CI compile the code and report errors
	- (local devs compilaer may be different from remote)
- checking semantics of code
- building docs
	- e.g., auto run javadoc
- running projects code tests
	- auto run JUnit, and report fails

## 3 Starting CI jobs
- from version control
	- e.g., every commit triggered CI jobs to run
	- starts on a push to server
- manually
- on a schedule

## 4 Runs asnychronously
- dont require devs to wait for completion
- common to run locally as well as on consistent standard environment

 other timescales
 - local checks as you commit
 - checks as you type
 - checks as you save

## 5 Output
since CI is asynchronous, its feedback is also

e.g., 
- web badges showing status
- can send emails
- messaging platform
	- e.g., slack, discord, teams
	- webhooks etc

git project websites usually provide logging interface,
will watch scripts in virtual terminal and capture output from CI scripts

## 6 Github piplines
a pipeline has multiple _stages_
- e.g., test, build, deploy
each stages has multiple _jobs_
- e.g., JUnit, custom tests, etc

## 7 Yaml
most Ci frameworks use YAML for their configuration
structured text based formats
- python-like format or â‰ˆJSON

## 8 configurationg from git repo
CI config often via file in git top-level directory
- CI is version managed

Gitlab pipeling specs go into .gitlab-ci.yaml:
- shows command sequece to run for a jon, within a stage
- output from commands is stored for a subsequent viewing
- indicates what files 'artifacts' should be kept from jobs
