# Warnings
- different CPU architectures have their own machine codes and their own assembly languages
- assembly language programs are **not** portable across CPU architectures (e.g., 6809 to x86 ARM) but are often backwards compatible (e.g., x86_64 family)

# Working up
- High level languages
	- Compiler
- Assembly language
	- Assembler
- Machine code
	- Instruction Set
- Hardware
