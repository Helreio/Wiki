**flow** in games: keep the player skill and the difficulty of the game balanced
- Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly. (1990). Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience. 

**VR/AR/MR/XR**
- all the things. important to know definitions and examples

**Displays
- HMD
	- need to adjust for IPD (interpupillary distance)
- projection
	- need to track user to give 3d impression
	- Stereo vision to see items "in front" of the screen not inside the screen
	- difficult to present different views for other people
	- eye dominance is a factor for things like pointing

**VST vs OST
- VST can easily adjust what the user sees
- OST can't fully occlude objects
- VST is better at most things but OST "feels" better
- OST very difficult to do spatial alignment as we need to continuously calibrate
