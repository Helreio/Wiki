**VR**
- computer generated environment
- 3D
- interactive with real time feedback
- _sense of presence_

**AR**
- embedded in real environment
- spatially aligned VR
- _impression of one single environment_

**Reality-Virtuality (RV) Continuum**
- Milgram & Kishino 1994
- Reality
- Augmented Reality
- Augmented Virtuality
- Virtuality

**Extended Reality (XR)**

| name         | features                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| immersion    | senses                                                                         |
| presence     | spatial/social/co/involvement/realism                                          |
| telepresence | user can interact with remote environment and feels present in the environemnt |


**XR Experience elements**

| sense augmentation | what information we provide to the senses of the user             |
| display            | display used to provide these augmentations                       |
| HCI                | how can users interaction with  this information in a natural way | 
| tracking           | tracking location of user                                         |


**Wearability**

**XR displays**
- Visual
	- Spatial
	- HMD
	- VST
	- OST
- Haptic
	- Active
	- Passive
- Acoustic, Thermal, Olfactory

**Spatial AR**
modify object by projecting information onto them, e.g.., Disney castle

> [!INFO] Ubiquitious: when we can no longer distinguish between computing area and the experience

**VST HMD***
![|300](https://i.imgur.com/eLiZVuD.png)

Issues: 
- user sees what the camera sees → can be different from the eye view
- cannot change focus distance of camera
- low res
- interpupillary difference
- colour difference

**OST**

Uses:
- HMD
- HUD e.g., speed/navigation while driving
- Stands e.g., in supermarket

**Localisation and tracking
- knowing where the user is in virtuality

Tools
- Markers
- SLAM
 
Types
- Inside out tracking
	- tracks environment relative to user
- outside in tracking
	- sensors in the environment track the user

To render things in the environment can estimate for example where the light sources are in the environment

**Interaction**
we are used to using  a keyboard and mouse. So how can we learn to interact with more complex environments

- Occlusion

- Gestures → using hand gestures as input
- Controllers → smartphones, joysticks etc (mohr)
	- Not good for crowded/social environments
- Touch pads on HMD (gugenheimer 2016)
- Eye tracking (lee 2016)
