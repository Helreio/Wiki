where to start? pretty overwhelmed with this whole blockchain thing. Not really sure where this project is going. At the moment what I understand is that I'm looking to a more open version of a closed blockchain. One which is initiated by a central authority e.g., the government, who then allows other parties to join. In the example with the organic supply wh- would each company who wanted to verify that their produce is organic, "join" a central blockchain. From the beginning of the (supply) chain to the end there are many different companies involved. So would the journey of the item be tracked on a blockchain? Maybe not neccessarily the journey but maybe throughout its route, each thing (or an agreement to provide that thing) that is need to prove an item's "organicness" is added to the chain, then when it reaches the end the chain is discarded? Surely that's not right. Does a blockchain necessarily need to represent a *sequence*? Yeah I think so. But a currency like bitcoin is an infinite sequence, whereas an items journey is finite. What does a blockchain used in a supply chain context represent?

From the abstract - "closed blockchains are considered by some to be insufficiently decentralised.This summer project aims to prototype a compromise: a closed blockchain system that encodes voting rules about self-governance, so that closed blockchain technology can be used in a more open manner"

"insufficiently decentralised" - closed blockchain are regulated by a central authority who decides who can join and leave the network. 

"closed blockchain system that encodes voting rules about self-governance" - this will allow users to come and go at will - to a degree. There must be some limiting factor because otherwise this is just an open blockchain.

I need to lower my expectation for the rate of progess I think. If I can establish a clear goal by the end of the week I will be happy.
