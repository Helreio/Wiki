where to start? pretty overwhelmed with this whole blockchain thing. Not really sure where this project is going. At the moment what I understand is that I'm looking to a more open version of a closed blockchain. One which is initiated by a central authority e.g., the government, who then allows other parties to join. In the example with the organic supply wh- would each company who wanted to verify that their produce is organic, "join" a central blockchain. From the beginning of the (supply) chain to the end there are many different companies involved. So would the journey of the item be tracked on a blockchain? Maybe not neccessarily the journey but maybe throughout its route, each thing (or an agreement to provide that thing) that is need to prove an item's "organicness" is added to the chain, then when it reaches the end the chain is discarded? Surely that's not right. Does a blockchain necessarily need to represent a *sequence*? Yeah I think so. But a currency like bitcoin is an infinite sequence, whereas an items journey is finite. What does a blockchain used in a supply chain context represent?
