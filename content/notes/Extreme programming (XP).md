take current industry practices to the extreme
- focus of proven industry practices
- combine them innovatively to get better results

##### Values and principles
communication, simplicity, feedback, courage.
- Planning -> based on user stories 
- Testing -> thorough testing at every step 
- Pair programming -> watch, inspect, and trade off 
- Simple designs -> based on agile modelling principles 
- Refactoring -> redo and clean up as you go 
- Collective code ownership -> egoless development, anyone can review and improve code 
- Continuous integration -> grow the software continuously
- On-site customer -> get sign-off as you go 
- System metaphor -> what should the final system look like? Small releases given to users frequently 
- Forty-hour work week -> donâ€™t overload the developers 
- Coding standards -> follow industry standards for code
