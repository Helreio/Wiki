# Pervasive and Ubiquitious computing

Natural user interfaces
- applications off desktop
- physical linteraction moving away from mouse/keyboard/display
- natural acations used as input to systems
- better learnability, easure of use. â‡’ support tasks without changing them
- support special needs people
