## my favs
- ZSH: Zsh is called Z Shell, which is an **extension of Bash** that has many new features and themes. Zsh was released in 1990 by Paul Falstad. Zsh has similarities with Korn shell as well. Linux and Mac OS use Bash as their default shell. Bash is the abbreviation of the Bourne-again shell.
- Powershell
- Git Bash: 
	- You can access both Git and Bash features on Windows, which are native to macOS and Linux users
	-  You can use Bash’s powerful features such as arithmetic, array variables, loops, and branches that are not available in Command Prompt.
