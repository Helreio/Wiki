# Plan

- Major points
	- reading
		- process
		- main findings
	- scenarios
	- solidity contract
		- thoughts leading up to it
		- what I think it would have been
	- what I got implemented
		- default contract


### Aim
The aim of this project was to consider aspects of a closed public permissioned blockchain. Currently some believe there is an issue with current permissioned blockchains in that they are not sifficiently decentralised. On the other hand open permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin are cumbersome to use due to their need for an associated cryptocurrency.

### Process
Stage 1 - understand blockchain and read general literature

Stage 2 - test Hayden's system from last year

Stage 3 - read papers similar to what we are trying to accomplish

Stage 4 - evaluate select scenarios that coild arise with the proposed system, considering how existing technology could be sed and how we could adapt it

Stage 5 - (incomplete) test out ideas for the proposed system in a small scale environment

### Scenarios


### Solidity Contract
Near the end of the project before my break I had decided to try to test the Add New Participant scenario. I decided to do this by making
