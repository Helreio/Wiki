- encapsulation
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/jOSWdJ4.png)
- Five layers in Internet: physical, data link, network, transport, application (including presentation and session layers of OSI model),

TCP/IP sits in kernel of operating system. packet is passed from RAM to the network card, then through the ethernet cable.

There is a specific bus for tcp/ip between ram and NIC

^ Data link and physical layer.

NIC rejects ehternet packets which aren't adresse to them. you can modify them to add a promoscuous mode which accepts all packets.

you can configure the swtich to send the packets to only the correct address

Network Layer â‰¡ IP layer

Port number distinguishes addresses at the transport/application layer. 

ARP - to find destination MAC address given IP address
- send broadcast message to everyone - who had this IP address? What is your MAC address
- the store the results of the MAC:IP pairing
