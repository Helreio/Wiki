There could be a number of reasons as to why the sync doesn't work. Here are some steps to follow to ensure the sync works as expected. 

1. Check that the username, password, and encryption key (if you have one) are correct
2. If two-way sync is enabled, ensure that the note-template is the default note template. You can refresh the template with the button beside it.
3. Once the above steps are done, try deleting all your Fleeting Notes. Then run the sync command to pull all the notes to a specified folder.
