# why
- apps for IoT devices contain security flaws
	- smart home security breaches
	- kindles
	- vulnerable libraries lead to vulnerable devices
- software helps us to use hardware
	- need to make the software secure

# overview
combines computer science, engineering, and maths to make software

- software engineering coined in 1968-1969 when discussing 'software cirsis'
	- security breaches
	- bugs etc

different from individual programming because of the Audience

- types
	- generic software
		- stand alone systems e.e.g, word etc
	- customized software
		- designed specifically for a customer
	- generic can transistion to customised

# dev process
- tried to mirror engineering process
- software is different
	- needs to be flexible

timeline
- waterfall
- spiral
- agile

# stages
- design
	- feasability
		- ![slide](https://i.imgur.com/KD8J4Dr.png)
