# Dist cognition

when interfaces help people disribute cognition it can
- exourage experimentsation
- scaffold learning and reuce errors through reduncdancy
- show (only) differences that matter
- convert slow calculation into fast perception
- support chunking, especially by experts
- increase effieciency
- facilitate collaboration

good representation shows only relevant information and enables:
- comparison
- exploration
- problem solving

deep vs shallow interface
