a friend of yours had a reaction to something so you might be interested in it too.

try to mute angry reactions


algorithms appeal to human nature - amplify things you are interested in - people are interested in things that upset them - it this too impactful - should we make it so there is no algorithm - just let people share what they share and find what they find and just let stuff exist.

- started this way when there was not technoology to rank stuff
- when you dont rank stuff the system gets "gamed" in other ways
	- e.g., most recent at the top
	- makes people post a lot
	- miss obviously really important stuff
		- e.g., sibilings getting married etc
			- this would get lots of reactions so this would be ranked higher

could just limit number of posts
- rank based on quality of posts etc



ability to control the flow of information
- company run by human beings that have the ability to to decide what is shown and supressed.
- this concerns a lot of people
