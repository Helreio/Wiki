# Routes and controllers
## MVC model
- design pattern
- used in ios development

routes - foward requests to appropriate controller functions
controller functions - get data from models, create html, display data, and return to view
views (templates) - used by controllers to render data

## Routes
 - a section of express code that assocaites an HTTP verb, and url path, and a function to handle that pattern
 - route is a middleware created by `var router = express.Router();`

### route path
- define endpoints at which requests can be made
- can be string patterns similar to regex

## route parameters
- named url segments used to capture values at specific positions in the url
- e.g., `/:user/`
- captures values are stored in `req.params` object
- names must be made up of "word characters"

## route functions
- express middleware â€” must respond to or call another function in the chain
- each functionis added to the middleware chain and is executed in order

## middleware
- objects that have access to req, res, and the next middleware function in the req-res cycle
- e.g.,
```
app.use()
app.METHOD()
router.use()
express.static
express.json
express.urlencoded
app.use(cookieParser())
```

- middleware can
	- execute code
	- change the req and response objects
	- end the req-res cycle
	- call next middleware function in stack
