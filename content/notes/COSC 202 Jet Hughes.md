# 1 Teamwork
a) 
-  Quality control
- Developer

These roles are compementary because the person in the quality control role, helps the developer to write better code

b) 
- Its can help to reduce errors via quality control and code review
- It can help to speed up development because two peolple will (usually) be faster than one

# 2 Ethics

a) One example could be an AI algorithm for a self driving car. There are mulitple ethical issues with this. The main one being the choice of whether to save the driver or the pedestrians in the event of an inevitable accicent. Another is whether or not it is morally right to produce these cars, knowing it is very possible that they could be hacked, and controlled by others.

b) 
1) Confront your manager, and explain to him your feelings, then quit
2) Another course of action you could take, which would be unethical, would be to confront him, and ask for a raise with the threat of quitting

# 3 Testing and Debugging

a) If you introduced a bug into your program,the bug is an array index out of bounds error, and the error message shows which method the bug occured. This debug symbol (the name of the method) is useful because it shows you where the bug is
b) 

| Unit tests                                             | end to end tests                           |
|:-------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| testing only small "unit" of the code e.g., one method | Test the entire system from "end" to "end" |
| Very quick to run, and are run frequently              | Often run less often                       |
| Independent so no dependencies                         | Often interconnected with other systems    |

# 4 Documentation and source code management

a) 
1) Open source contributors - if the project is open source, it is very useful to provide documentation so that is is as easy as possible for other people to understand your code, and thus contribute to it
2) Users of a public API - the people who want to use the API, need to now about the data they can get, what authentication they need to provide, what parameters they should consider, and many other things. 


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# 5 Continuous integration and automation

a) 
1) IDEs - These can be used to greatly speed up development with advanced tools like code completion, and many other things. They are best suited for large projects, with many team members. However there are also many lightweight IDEs (e.g., vscode) which are also quite suitable for small projects
2) shell scripting languages(e.g., poweshell, bash, fish, etc) - can be used to automate quick and simple tasks. They are not suited for more complex tasks as edge cases and quirks become hard to handle and are usually not worth the time. For these tasks you could use python or some other language.
