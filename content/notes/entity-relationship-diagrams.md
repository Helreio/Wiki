cardinality
identifying vs non identifying relationship

labels are important - but not always needed

associative entity => changes many to many relationship with additional relationship

## 0.1 subtypes

uses:
- model mutual exclusivity
- better for modelling not for implementation

## 0.2 parallel relationship

could model as separate relationships via staff subtypes
not very common

also an example of recursive many-to-many relationships

## 0.3 recursive relationship
labels are critical
usually 1:M can be 1:1 or M:M

## 0.4 dealing with data history

could be many to many relationships:![](https://i.imgur.com/g4ynsh2.png)

so associative relationship: ![](https://i.imgur.com/NXxsJRl.png)

what do we require:
- for the current point in time
- an histroical record how â‡’ must be selecetive to not use up to much space
