- a vector space is a set whose elements conform to the eight axioms of scaling and additiveness
- e.g.,
	- ℝ², ℝ³, P₃
- In this course we focus on three main vector spaces
	- ℝⁿ, Pₙ, $M_{m\times n}$ 

- a vector subspace is a subset of a vector space whose elements (which are vectors) are additively and multipicatively closed and contain the zero vector
