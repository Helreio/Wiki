| Heuristic | Severity |  Location | Description | Recommendation |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| aesthetic and minimalist design | 1 | General |  User interface is ugly | Should be made to look better |
| flexibility and efficieny of use | 2 | In a room | not clear to find where to sign out | Should add a button to sign out from within a room |
| visibility of system status | 1 | In a room | There is not indication about which rooms you should be using | Should be able to restrict users to only enter certain rooms |
| user control and freedom | 2 | In the cafe | There is no way to change, mute, or adjust he volume of the music | A button/group of button should be added for this |
| flexibility and effieciency of use | 1 | In a room | The buttons for mute, video, share screen etc which are usually (in most video call apps) in the bottom middle of the screen are instead spread out in the top corners | Move them to the bottom middle of the screen |
| recognition vs recall | 2 | In a room | The icon to show and hide the left side bar is not clear | This icon should be changed to be more recogniseable |
| aesthetic and minimalist design | 1 | In the cafe | When at a table in the cafe almost a quater of the screen i taken up by a button to go leave the table | Should be made smaller |
| flexibility and efficiency of use | 1 | Posting a Question | The checkbox to make a question anonymous is very small and the text is not clickable | The text should be made clickable or the checkbox should be made larger |
| recognition vs recall | 1 | In a room | The '+1' icon next to questions is not clearly clickable | Should be made to look more like a clickable button |
| error prevention | 3 | In a room | The pop out button below the step to mic button opens a windows which is completely broken ![](https://i.imgur.com/HIx9CIy.png)| Needs to be fixed or removed |
