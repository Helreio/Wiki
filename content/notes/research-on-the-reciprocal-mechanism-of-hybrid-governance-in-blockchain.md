# Summary
This paper investigates the idea of reciprocal blockchain governance. It identifies two major processes of blockchain governance: 
- governance _of_ the BC – where stakeholders, and social market evaluate performance of BC and make improvements. This occurs off-chain
- governance _by_ the BC –  applying consensus protocols, and node control using BC as a medium. Occurs on chain

They propose that neither on-chain governance-by-BC nor off-chain governance-of-BC are sufficient and that these methods should be combined and used to inform each other. They evaluate the effe
