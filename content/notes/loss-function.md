Used to measure performance/accuracy of [[machine-learning]] models.

measure of performance is the **classification error** expressed as a percentage i.e., the number of outputs that are mislabelled $(0...1)$

**accuracy** is the inverse of classification error i.e., $accuracy = 1 - classification\ error$

**mean squared error** measures the *distance* of models output from target value i.e., how wrong is the model $(y-\hat{y}^2)$

we can also use a [[confusion-matrix]] to measure the distribution of errors
