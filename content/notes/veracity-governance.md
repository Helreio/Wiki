note: nothing about this document is final. I expect it will evolve a lot. I just want to start to get some basic structure down.

# Aim

# Stakeholders
- Main Authority e.g., govt
- Other Participants
	- Agriculture
		- Large Corporations
		- Small/Family owned
	- Food-Manufacturing
	- Retail/Marketing
	- Shipping?

Who operates the nodes?

Direct: Stakeholders who interact with the blockchain
Indirect: Stakeholders who are affected by but do not interact with the blockchain

Things to consider:
- Should small and large business have equal weight in the vote?
- ~~Will small businesses be able to set up the required infrastructure?~~
	- What is the required infrastructure â€” I think they just use a website/app to upload information

# Process for Change
Can/Should we use a system similar to EIPs/BIPs?
- 

# Voting Protocol

# Handling Disagreements
