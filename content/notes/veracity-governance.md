I just started this to get some basic structure down.

# Aim
I have decided to start from a base such as ethereum and work to adapt it to what I need. I think by doing this I will either create a solution or gain a much better understanding of the problems which would allow me to create my own solution from the ground up.

Possible starting points
- swarm.city
- alastria
- various DAOs
- ethereum
- bitcoin

The governance of a blockchain can be split into four main components [](notes/a%20systematic%20literature%20review%20on%20blockchain%20governance.md)

# Stakeholders
- Main Authority e.g., govt
- Other Participants
	- Agriculture
		- Large Corporations
		- Small/Family owned
	- Food-Manufacturing
	- Retail/Marketing
	- Shipping?

Who operates the nodes?

Direct: Stakeholders who interact with the blockchain
Indirect: Stakeholders who are affected by but do not interact with the blockchain

Things to consider:
- Should small and large business have equal weight in the vote?
- ~~Will small businesses be able to set up the required infrastructure?~~
	- What is the required infrastructure â€” I think they just use a website/app to upload information

# Process for Change
Can/Should we use a system similar to EIPs/BIPs?
- 

# Voting Protocol

# Handling Disagreements
