note: nothing about this document is final. I expect it will evolve a lot. I just want to start to get some basic structure down.

# Aim

# Stakeholders
Three main industries
- Agriculture
	- Farms
		- Large Corporations
			- Possibly a representative (or group of reps) from within the org
		- Small/Family owned
			- May not be 'tech savvy'
			- Can choose to be any type of node.
- Food-Manufacturing
- Retail/Marketing
- + End consumer

Direct: Stakeholders who interact with the blockchain
Indirect: Stakeholders who are affected by but do not interact with the blockchain

Things to consider:
- Should small and large business have equal weight in the vote?
- ~~Will small businesses be able to set up the required infrastructure?~~
	- What is the required infrastructure â€” NVM I think they just use a website/app to upload information

# Process for Change
Can/Should we use a system similar to EIPs/BIPs?
- 

# Voting Protocol

# Handling Disagreements
