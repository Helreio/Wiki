# Interviews
## Use Cases
- [[Evaluating designs]]
- [[Requirements elicitation]]
- [[Needfinding]]

## Overview
- direct and stuctured
- semi structured
- usually top down
- effective for high level interface evaluation
- need careful planning, experts, difficult to analyse
- not a controlled experiment technique

## Conducting an interview
### Choosing participants
- some is better than none
- get pople who are representive of users
	- users of existing similar system
	- non-users -> why people arent using a system
	- e.g., lecture support system
		- teachers
		- students
		- staff
		- admins
		- parents
		- freshman
		- phd
		- international domestic
		- stronger and weaker
		
#### Recruiting
- Craiglist (in US)
- your network
- cheaper for less speciales users
- if you can convince people you are imporving the world they might volunteer
- if they think is is for profict they will expect to be paid
- if you cant pay -> you cant use a token of appreciation

### Process
- introduce yourself explaint he purpose
- the interview is about them, not you?
- begin with open, unbiased questions-> then follow up
- ask the questions, and let them answer
- have breaks and give them time
- have a clear separation between the general introduction, the actual interview, and post inteview discussions

### Questions to avoid:
- leading questions
- what would they do / like / want in a hypothetical scenario
- how often they do things
- how much they like things on an absolute scale
- avoid binary questions

## Pros/cons
+ free and open answers
+ sense of active contribution
+ oppportunity for follow up
- time consuming and resource intensive
- dependent of commication skills of analyst
- location/schedule can make this impractical
