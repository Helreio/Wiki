Why do we do things: usually to be happy. some might say — no i life my life to serve i sacrifice i volunteer etc — but this still on some level, brings them happiness. 

But then why do people to so many things that make them unhappy (e.g., jealousy, guilt). Some people say (in a very shopenhauer approach to things) that these things happen because of survival, the will to life. 

but then if the goal was survival, why do people go skydiving etc. Its more complex than just survival

Nietzsche says its not will to happiness, its not will to survival, its will to power. by power he means becoming who you are, finding yourself. 

We are a part of the animal kingdom, we are part of an ecosystem. other animals e.g., bears have a will to power, to imporve their curcumstances. We are the same, but we have big brains so their are more ways to achieve this.
