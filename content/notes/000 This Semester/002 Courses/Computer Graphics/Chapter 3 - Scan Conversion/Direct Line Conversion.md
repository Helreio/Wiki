# Direct Line Conversion

## 1. How does this conversion work?
----
1. First get the line equation from the points[[#^a29a1d]]
2. see if ==mâ‰¤1==
	1. for every point of ==x(x is increased by 1 in every step) calculate y==
3. else
	1. for every point of ==y(y is increased by 1) calculate x==

## 2. How to get equation from the points? ^a29a1d
1. First calculate slope m, using the equation
  $$ m = (y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)$$
2. Then get b by plug in $x_1$ and $y_1$ in the line equation.
