# What is a virtual Machine
A computer inside a computer. A computer contains hardware, cpu, ram , storage, etc. To use it we must install an OS. You think that to use another OS, you need another computer. But you can actually but this "computer" inside your existing computer.  This is done using a hyper visor

# What is a Hypervisor
This is a fancy word for an application you install. A good one to use is called virtualbox. The job of the hypervisor is to control computers inside you computers. These virtual computers "think" they are real computers.

## Type 1
Installed on the hardware. e.g., VMware. Can be installed on any computer. Typically used in companies on large servers. 

## Type 2
Installed on a "host OS". Vitual machines use "guest" OSs.

# Why would you want a hyper visor
- safe and secure for learning hacking
- to learn different operating systems
- to try breaking stuff
