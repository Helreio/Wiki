Aim
The aim of this project was to consider aspects of an closed public permissioned Blockchain. Currently some believe there is an issue with current closed permissioned blockchains in that they are not sufficiently decentralized. On the other hand, open permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin are cumbersome to use due to the need for an associated cryptocurrency and the issues that come with it.

Stage 1 - understanding Blockchain and reading relevant literature

Stage 2 - test Hayden's system from last year

Stage 3 - read papers similar to what we are trying to accomplish.

Stage 4 - evaluate select scenarios that could arise within the system, considering how existing technology could be used and how we could adapt it

Stage 5 (not completed) - test out ideas in a small scale environment
