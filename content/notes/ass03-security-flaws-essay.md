5pm 
- phone powered down
- This was irritating, but I wasn’t concerned
- assumed it was a software glitch
- phone automatically backs up
- I was irritated, but not alarmed.
- the screen went gray, and asked for a four-digit PIN
- I knew something was very, very wrong.
- unplugged my router and cable modem, turned off the Mac Mini
- called AppleCare
- a call had been placed just a little more than a half an hour before my own.
- Apple rep didn't bother to tell me about the first call concerning my account
- only shared this information after I asked about it
- someone called AppleCare claiming to be me.
	- reported that he couldn't get into his Me.com e-mail
	- issued a temporary password
	- despite the caller’s inability to answer security questions I had set up
	- it did this after the hacker supplied only two pieces of information that anyone with an internet connection and a phone can discover.
- a password reset confirmation arrived in my inbox
	- I don’t really use my me.com e-mail, and rarely check i
	- hackers immediately sent it to the trash.
	- reset my AppleID password
- Gmail password recovery e-mail
	- Google account password had changed
- reset my Twitter password.
- used iCloud’s “Find My” tool to remotely wipe my iPhone, iPad, Macbook
- deleted my Google account
- the attackers posted a message to my account on Twitter taking credit for the hack.
- not only had the ability to control my account, but were able to prevent me from regaining access
- those deletions were just collateral damage
