In compsci a map is a comprised of a set of keys and values. (`<K, V>`). For example `<String, Integer>`

So sets are a prerequisite for maps

The fundamental map operations are:
- `Put(k, v)` --> Add the this key-value pair to the map. If the present: update the key
- `Get(k)` --> returns the value associated with `` is present
- `Remove(k)` --> Removes the key `k`
