<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">what about ChatGPT? </mark> I don't really recommend it?? I mean if I can't have any more ask from Bing AI then sure, but personally prefer The New Bing its UX is way more clean and pretty. 

Bing currently it has only up to 120 aks per day divided in 10 messages per session chunks, then you will have to initiate another session if you want to ask more.

The 3 of these can write code and solve math problems so it's great!


## chrome extensions
- [Merlin AI chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/merlin-chatgpt-assistant/camppjleccjaphfdbohjdohecfnoikec)
