2023-07-25 12:50 pm	Creating my first file inside Hugo-based Quartz

2023-07-25 15:15 pm	It's now ready for publication

2023-07-25 15:40 pm	In theory, I should update the languages to include Russian and English and Hebrew and French (and update the corresponding titles)

https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages
In practice, I'll probably never get around to adding any languages other than English, and *that's okay*.
