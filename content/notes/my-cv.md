# Career Objective
I am open to a role in a wide variety of areas: Web Development, ML/AI, Game Development and AR/VR. I enjoy solving complex problems and experimenting with new tech. 

I often stay up far too late fixating on a stubborn bug or a difficult feature. But the satisfaction I get when I finally solve it, quite often warrants a little dance. These moments are why I enjoy computer science so much.

# Skill Summary
## Problem-Solving
Ever since I was a kid, solving problems has been one of my favourite things. I have grown a lot since my days of engineering Lego machines and finding creative ways to read at night without my parents knowing. I recently transformed my GoPro into a motion detector and made an app to track my snowboarding progress. These projects were direct solutions to problems I faced often. I wanted to know which member of the family was stealing my cookies, so I made a motion detector. I wanted to have a clear picture of what my snowboarding goals were and what I needed to do to achieve them, so I created an app which helped me do those things. I love solving problems. Tell me yours! 

## Independent Learning
To create these solutions, I needed to learn new things. My desire to solve problems, necessitates independent learning. While the things I've learned at school and in university have been helpful, their real value to me is that they provide a launching pad from which I can expand my knowledge, and dive deeper into technologies I find interesting and exciting, and technologies I can use to solve whatever problem I have.

## Communication
For the past 2 years, I have been working part-time for Company-X. My job was to assemble e-learning modules in different languages. This project involved working under a project manager and with multiple teams, spread across the globe. Initially we were a team of four people, but after the first few weeks I was working on the project independently. Working with many international teams provided a huge challenge, as they did not always have great English speaking skills. This meant I had to communicate very clearly, and make absolutely sure that I correctly understood the client and their requests. Furthermore, I had to manage communication with my project manager, and keep him up-to-date and informed.

# Project Experience
## Album of the Day Website
[Album website GitHub repo](https://github.com/JetHughes/album)

This is my most recent project. I created this as a way to put in to practice the things I have been learning at university. It is a basic website with user authentication and authorization. It is built using Express and Pug and is hosted on AWS.

## React Native App
[React Native app GitHub repo](https://github.com/JetHughes/snowboard-goals-app)

This was one of my first large projects. It was my year 13 IT scholarship project. It is built using React-Native and Expo. Throughout the creation of this project, I had to consider many factors besides the code. This included working with a stakeholder, considering legal and ethical implications, privacy, security, UI design, Iterative development and more.

## Motion Detector
[Motion Detector GitHub repo](https://github.com/JetHughes/motion-detector)

This was a small project I made last summer. Someone was stealing my cookies, so rather than recording 24/7 I configured my GoPro to stream to an RTMP server. This video was then analysed by a python script using OpenCV, and I was alerted when motion was detected.

## Python Bots
GitHub slack bot](https://github.com/JetHughes/discord-album-bot) GitHub album bot](https://github.com/JetHughes/slack-album-bot)

Some simple slash command bots for discord and slack. They both make an api request and return some information. The slack bot is a flask app currently running on an AWS Lambda function, but the discord one is not running.

## Non-Destructive Image Editor
This was a group project for my software development paper last semester. We were provided with the basic skeleton of the app, then we had to add features such as: zoom, image saving, and various image filters such as sharpen, posterise, contrast and brightness and more. We also had to add unit testing, mange communication, set deadlines, allocate tasks, and maintain a repository.

- Philosophy: Food for the brain  Currently 100 episodes into Philosophize This by Stephen West
- Cooking: Japanese, Mexican, Chinese, Thai, Indian, Caveman, etc  I love trying new things
- Reading: Currently reading Out of the flames by Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone  a book about Michael Servetus's work.
