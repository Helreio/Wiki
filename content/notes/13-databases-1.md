# Data modelling
first step in designing database
- create a data model for a specific problem domain

a model is Defn: a collection of concepts that can be used to describe the structure of a database such as data types, relationsips, and contraints that should hold for the data

schema Defn: a collection of metadata that describes the logical view of a database

noSQL databases are either schema-free or have relaxed schemas
