# Combinatorial Logic Circuit
> [!Definition]
> Combinatorial Logic Circuit is a circuit whose digital outputs are dependent only on its digital inputs
They can be described using logic expressions and therefore logic gates. We assume the outputs respond immediately^[1]

They can be defined:
- Using a truth table
- Using boolean equations ($Q\ =\ A+\ B$) 
- Using graphical symbols

- 1 Bit full adder: (includes carry input) [](https://i.imgur.com/yu6kS83.png)
 


# Circuit basics:
- current flows + to -
- input to a unit (e.g., LED) is the + end

# Logic Gates
- NOT
- AND
- OR
- NAND
- NOR
- XOR/EOR




[^1] : In real circuits propagation delay must be considered, hence the clock cycle on CPUs
