- Lower risk
- Avoid avi terrain
- safety gear
- what to consider
- using a guide


Reducing risk
- total avoidance (dont go backcountry at all)
- avoidance lite (avoid all avalanche terrain)
- recognising risk, accepting it, minimizing exposure 
- use bulletin

avoidance
- 	stay in bounds/on piste
- 	use low angle slopes
- 	steep: 30-45 degrees

minimize exposure to risks
- know if you are in avalanche terrain
	- maps, guidbooks, photos
	- clinometers
	- _quality_ level 1 course 

Use the bulletin forecast
- low
- moderate : natural avalanches not likely, man made avalanches possible if you ski in the wrong spot
- considerable: if you ski in the wrong spot, human triggered avalances are likely

no overhead hazard: not below a large face or something

avalanche problem:
- persistent weak layer
- wind drifted snow

whoomps under skis: collapsing snow, avalanches likely
