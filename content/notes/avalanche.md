- Lower risk
- Avoid avi terrain
- safety gear
- what to consider
- using a guide


Reducing risk
- total avoidance (dont go backcountry at all)
- avoidance lite (avoid all avalanche terrain)
- recognising risk, accepting it, minimizing exposure 
- use bulletin

avoidance
- 	stay in bounds/on piste
- 	use low angle slopes
- 	steep: 30-45 degrees

minimize exposure to risks
- know if you are in avalanche terrain
	- maps, guidbooks, photos
	- clinometers
	- _quality_ level 1 course 

Use the bulletin forecast
- low
- moderate : natural avalanches not likely, man made avalanches possible if you ski in the wrong spot
- considerable: if you ski in the wrong spot, human triggered avalances are likely

no overhead hazard: not below a large face or something

avalanche problem:
- persistent weak layer
- wind drifted snow

whoomps under skis: collapsing snow, avalanches likely

lots of different types of avalanche. loose vs slab, wet vs dry.

usually: strong snow over weak snow.

strong: often wind effect: ltighly bonded grains
weak: light snow with no wind and cold clear nights

important: slope angle 

## Snowpack tests

- compression test
	- locating instabilities near surface
	- 30(upslope not horixontal) x30cmx110cm ()
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ebmXC6M.png)
	- tap 10 times with finger tips
		- mark factures as easy
	- level column
	- tap 10 times with finger tips from elbow
	- level
	- tap with hand or fist from shoulder

- deep tap test
	- similar to compression test but tests only for weak persistent layer relatively deep in the snowpack
- extended column test
	- same as compresion test but 90cm wide not just 30cm

- rutschblock test

- propagation saw test
- shovel shear test
- hand shear test

equipment
- shovel
- probe
- snow saw
- ruler
- cord
