I've been thinking a lot recently about whether I want to be "Great"

Obviously I would be a good thing. But would It be worth it and is it something that I actually want to pursue. Not sure

Is it selfish to want to be remembered? I don't think so. I guess it might be comforting to know that future generations will remember me? 

I ~~might~~ will take a LOT of hard work. Is there an element of luck? Yes of course, but I think that hard work can overcome almost any amount of bad luck. 

Should I just try to enjoy life "in the moment". Yeah, I can do both at the same time. 

Cracking my neck feels so good.

Someone said "the highest highs require the lowest lows". Do I wan't to live a medioce, life. Mediocre does not imply "bad". Although it does have those connotations. Is life worth living if I don't pursue greatness. What is the point. It'll just be "good". Nothing special. Yeah there'll (is that a word)
