I've been thinking a lot recently about whether I want to be "Great"

Obviously I would be a good thing. But would It be worth it and is it something that I actually want to pursue. Not sure

Is it selfish to want to be remembered? I don't think so. I guess it might be comforting to know that future generations will remember me? 

I ~~might~~ will take a LOT of hard work. Is there an element of luck? Yes of course, but I think that hard work can overcome almost any amount of bad luck. 

Should I just try to enjoy life "in the moment". Yeah, I can do both at the same time. 

Cracking my neck feels so good.

Someone said "the highest highs require the lowest lows". Do I wan't to live a medioce, life. Mediocre does not imply "bad". Although it does have those connotations. Is life worth living if I don't pursue greatness. What is the point. It'll just be "good". Nothing special. Yeah there'll (is that a word?) be some ~~good~~ ~~great~~ sublime (?) moments. But these could be so much better if _

Seems like an obvious choice. 

Why doesn't everyone pursue greatness. 

Laziness? Why are people lazy? Is it because they don't have purpose? This lack of purpose makes them think nothing matters and therefore they have no reason not be lazy? Then why aren't more people nihilistic? They must have something they care about. They just don't *really* care. To them, it's not worth the effort. 

I could ~~easily~~ certainly (spelling?) get better grades if I cared more. Is it an issue of caring though? Maybe I care just the right amount, and I have subconciously calculated the exact amount of effort I need to put in to be "good enough". 

How have I decided what good enough it to me. I imagine it would be almost fully dependent on ^(the influence of) peers and parents.  

Can I change my decision about what is good enough? Obiviously other people (breathas) lower standards and people like Luc have higher standards (straight A+ wtf luc if ur reading this ur insane). Luc will get a better grade than me at cosc203. He cares more about his grades. 

Sidetracked. Can I conciously decide to care more. Am I able to change my subconcious drive. I think by surrounding myself with people who work harder, I can make myself work harder. Why then, despite all the bullshit "productivity" vides i've watched, do it still procrastinate like a fucking 

Do animals procrastinate?? Interesting

Why do people prcrastinate? Laziness, no purpose blah etc.

Is it genetic?? Yes, I think genetic must play a role. Attention span (?), memory, energy levels, hormones, chemicals etc. 

I still think hard work can overcome these things.

~~Am I willing~~ Can I make myself willing to be great? 

Building habits, "Dicipline", learning the fundamentals properly, understanding not observing and memorising. 

Is that all bullshit? 

Alex _ video about cooking and gym - "everything works". Minor adjustments only provide miniscule improvements. VS "1% ing".

How much different is there between being a little bit great (yt er) vs really great (jobs, musk, bezos) (are they even great?) vs the best (ghandi, socrates aristotle, nietzsche, khan, ceasar, francis, etc )

Why did I just rank philosophers and historical figures? ~~It is because I~~ Why do I consider them to be the greatest ~~or~~ is it because they are the oldest? Or because I respect philosophers more than.. They're not even all philosophers. This is stupid

Do I want to be great? Or do I want to be a little bit great? I think on my current path I will be a big fat nobody. I don't want to be a nobo

Would that be so bad? I'm conflating the idea of being a nobody with working a boring desk job. That, I dont want. But I can be a "nobody" and still be great? What even is greatness? Is it to be remembered? Thats the real question. Do I want to be remembered (in a positive manner). Not sure yet I guess. 

Fuck that, a decision isn't just going to pop into my head. I need to decide (story of my life).
