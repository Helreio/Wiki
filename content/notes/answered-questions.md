- [x] what actually is hyperledger fabric? Is it a closed blockchain that different groups can run independently for their own use-case? Or is it one single closed blockchain that many different groups participate in.
	- hyperledger fabric is one of the projects created by hyperledger. It is a framework/base from which the community can develop their own blockchains.
- [x] is governance within a closed blockchain the same as within an open blockchain
	- no I dont think so.[Governance of open vs closed blockchains](notes/governance.md#Governance%20of%20open%20vs%20closed%20blockchains)
- [x] does the central authority e.g., govt decide who can join and leave?
	- yes, but is this responsibility restricted only to them? Can other parties approve new participants?
- [x] What are public vs private permissioned blockchains
	- [blockchain-types](notes/blockchain-types.md)
- [x] why would a participant want to fork?
	- just having the capability is important
		- means the authority has to act in the interest of the parites otherwise they will fork
	- swtiching authorities?
