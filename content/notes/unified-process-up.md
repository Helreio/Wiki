#### Review questions
1. give a brief description of UP
UP is an iterative and incremental develoopment process

2. Give a brief description of each of the four phases of UP
	1. inception
	2. elaboration
	3. constuction
	4. transition

-------------------------------------------------------
# Unified process (UP)
oop development
uses UML for modelling
four phase life cycle
- inception
- elaboration
- construction
- transition

##### best practices
- develop iteratively
- define and mange system requirements
	- effectively managing changes in requirements
- use component architectures
- create visual models (UML)
- verify quality 
- Control changes

##### Values and principles
Values:
- **individuals and interactions** over processes and tools 
- **working software** over comprehensive documentation 
- **customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **responding to change** over following a plan

Twelve modelling principles:

> Build only necessary models that are useful and at the right level of detail

- Software is your primary goal — don’t get distracted by
documentation or models.
- The next effort is your secondary goal — be aware of next
step versions or revisions.
- Minimise modelling — only build what helps move the project
forward.
- Embrace change, change incrementally — take small steps
that keep you on track and that can be reversed if necessary.
- Model with a purpose — to understand and communicate.
- Build multiple models — look at problems from different
perspectives.
- Build high-quality models and get feedback — from [stakeholders](content/notes/stakeholders.md), other developers.
- Focus on content, not representation — always focus on stakeholder needs; informal hand-drawn models are often fine.
- Communicate and learn from each other.
- Know your models and how to use them.
- Adapt to specific project needs.
- Maximise stakeholder ROI.
