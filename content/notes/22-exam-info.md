# Topics: 
## Ubiquitous Computing: 
		- Concept & Visions 
		- Examples for Ubiquitous Computing 
		- Common characteristics 
		- Ubiquitous Computing vs. Pervasive Computing vs. Mobile Computing vs. Traditional Computing 
		- Challenges		
> [!INFO] what we need to undetstand
> what is ubiquiitous computing? general concept, vision, etc. computers become smaller/cheaper - become almost everywhere
> graphics -> ubiquiteous vs pervasive vs mobile vs traditional. 2 axis scale, mobility and embeddedness. UBI:mobile and embedded. PERVAS:embedded not mobile. MOBILE: mobile not embedded. TC: neither. 
> for an example about ubiquitous need to explain why it is embedded
> even if an example is not needed: use an example to explain. 


## Snap Spectacles and Snaps Lens Studio development and project 
> [!INFO] just general knowledge


## Sensors: 
> [!INFO] 1 vs 2 vs three degrees of freedom
> trilateration/angulation: explain and give example for each. most computer vision things use triangulation
> proximity example: wifi (but can be extended to location)

> [!IMPORTANT] Come up with examples for a lot of things

- Accuracy vs. Precision 
- Degrees of Freedom 
- Trilateration (GPS) and Triangulation 
- Location 
	- Geographic 
	- Topological 
	- Cell-based 
	- Proximity

> [!INFO] RUn through each of these things for different sensors: e.g., accelerometer

- Cell-based sensors (GSM/3G/4G, Wifi, ..) 
- Fingerprinting 
- Proximity-based sensors (Infrared, NFC/RFID, Bluetooth) 
- GPS 
	- Functionality, Messages exchanged, Constraints, â€¦ 
	- Differences with and between AGPS, DGPS, RTK GPS
	
> [!INFO] be able to explain how GPS works. how do we know position. general funcitonality
	
- Orientation Sensors: 
	- Accelerometers 
	- Compass 
	- Gyroscope (Drift!) 
- Sensor Fusion 
	- Filter-based sensor fusion 
	- Dead Reckoning 
	- Kalman
- Vision-based Sensors 
	- Marker-based Tracking 
	- Natural Feature-based Tracking & SIFT & SLAM 
	- Main stages of SIFT 
	- Invariances of SIFT (why? how?) 
	- Model-based Tracking
- Using a camera as sensor, advantages and challenges

# Example Questions: 
- Contrast Bluetooth LE and NFC technology for sensing your location. 
- Explain how cell phone towers can be used for estimating your position (cell-based localisation). Explain also different techniques that can be utilised to refine the position estimate 
- Explain Realtime Kinematics (RTK) GPS. How does it achieve improvements of traditional GPS? 
- Describe the sensors you would use for a fitness tracker application on your mobile phone. How would you refine or transform raw sensor readings to be of use? 
- What is Tangible Computing and how can it help to realise the concept for Ubiqitious Computing? 
- Contrast different classes of Augmented Reality interfaces. 
- Name and describe challenges when developing an optical see-through Augmented Reality interface compared to video-see through Augmented Reality interface? 
- Explain the concept of proxemic interaction within the context of Ubiqitious Computing. 
- Identify three different context-sources and their correspondig contexttargets in common mobile phones. 
- Discuss the degrees of freedom and expected accuracy and precision for a compass magnetometer (Compass). Why would you recommend its usage despite given limitations? 
- Why is sensing crucial for the concept of Ubiqitious Computing? 
- Identify 5 challenges for the concept of Ubiqitious Computing. Provide possible directions for overcoming the identified challenges. 
- Outline the communication beween satellites and receivers for GPSbased localisation. Explain the three components of the satellites and how they are used by the receiver.

Scenario A - The university wants to track position of people on the campus (e.g. for emergency reasons) 
- You are the contractor or want to get the contract. 
- Please brainstorm and discuss solutions (approach, advantages, disadvantages). 
- Give a final recommendation

Scenario B - The university wants to extend the system from Scenario A to also be able to understand what the people are doing (context) 
- You are the contractor or want to get the contract. 
- Please brainstorm and discuss solutions (approach, advantages, disadvantages). 
- Give a final recommendation
