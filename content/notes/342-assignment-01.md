# Log
31/03
- Collected images from around the lab and out the windows.
- I created mosaics from the image pairs to see if the images were ok
- A lot of the images had mismatches in similar areas at the bottom of the match
- I think this might be because I rotated from my body while taking the photos, rather than rotating just the phone.
- So I'll try to take some more pictures by rotating just the phone and see how they look
- I also need to develop a selection of images that I need to get
- There are also some issues with the display of the mosaic. doesn't always fit perfectly on screen and there were a few instances of line of randomly colours pixels on the screen
