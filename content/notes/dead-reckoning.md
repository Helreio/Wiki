- prediction of current location based of previous state
- estimating current position using previously known position, and direction, and speen, and elapsed time.

**Cons**
- small errors lead to incorrect positions
- cumulative error
- periodic recalibration required

**Example**
- going through tunnel
- GPS is blocked
- predict location from speed, location, direction, time
