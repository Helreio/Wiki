This is my personal view on what steps someone should take to get a grasp on "Web3 security" and also to have an appropraite mental framework for security in general. It is not meant to be comprehensive, but only to give you the tools to get a reasonable grasp of the landscape, so much so that you can make good personal decisions for yourself on where you'd like to go. 

I used to run the Security track of the KERNEL program, and a part of that curriculum was an introduction to the security landscape done by me. It is meant to teach people the general landscape of security within web3, a mental model for thinking about security in general, and some thoughts on how the Web3 security landscape is differentiated from the traditional one. The video can be found below along with the slides:
