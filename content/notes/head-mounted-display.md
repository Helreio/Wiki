A screen placed near the users eye typically used for [[Extended Reality|XR]] applications

## Types

Two main types: [[video-see-through|VST]] and [[optical-see-through|OST]]

VST
- can easily adjust what the user sees
- is better at most things but OST "feels" better

OST
- can't fully occlude objects
- very difficult to do spatial alignment as we need to continuously calibrate

## Issues
- need to adjust for [[inter-pupilliary-distance|IPD]]
