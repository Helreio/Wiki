So many people ask "what is the meaning of my life". There is no easy answer to this

Since everyone is born into this condition Nietzsche asks — "Why aren't the vast majority of people nihilistic"

the reason is bevaus when you come of age and ask these questions, historically speaking people have always had a choice between many different "true world theories"

e.g., platos world of forms. Things in the world are imperfect representations of a "ideal form". 

this implies that the world is a earthly shadow of a "real world"

nietsche would call this the true world of this true world theory


e.g., christian, earth vs afterlife. you are an eternal spirit inhabiting a temporary body. We should focus of heaven

∴ heaven is the true world of this true world theory


e.g., hinduism/buddism: a wave is a temporary manifestation of the ocean: its not separate from the ocean. In that sense we too are waves. temporary manifestation of some spirit world or the totality of the universe. individuality is an illusion, we are all one thing

this one thing is the true world


There are many more and they are all very similar. Niezsche would say these true world theoru
