# Is it immoral to keep free will from people if you had the power to grant it.

This is really two questions. Firstly, is free will good thing? Secondly, if it is a good this — is witholding it immoral? Is it even to possible for making decision on behalf of everyone to be moral or immoral? There's no way to know what people want, and you dont have the right to decide for them. To answer the first question, I think each person must come to their own conclusion, therefore it would be immoral to decide that the entire human race must have free will, and the second question is moot.
