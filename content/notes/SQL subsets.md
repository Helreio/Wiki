SQL has several subsets that are used for different purposes:
-   DDL (Data Definition Language): It defines the data structure and schema of the database. It includes commands such as CREATE, ALTER, DROP and RENAME.
-   DML (Data Manipulation Language): It manipulates the data in the database. It includes commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE
-   DCL (Data Control Language): It controls the access and permissions of the data. It includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE
-   TCL (Transaction Control Language): It manages the transactions in the database. It includes commands such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK and SAVEPOINT

There are also other subsets of SQL such as DQL (Data Query Language), which is used to query data from a database, and SCL (Session Control Language), which is used to manage sessions in a database.
