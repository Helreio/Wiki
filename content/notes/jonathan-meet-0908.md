Questions:
- can i uninstall old versions of visual studio
- any ideas why I cant log in my student account?
- how can i free up some disk space


some python thing to view cameras

opencv not fast enough to write frames


data sets exist with calibration for 4 things

processing just didn't get done


markus is by camera frame. not video



plan to write unity program to import frames and do something there. if using "dennis" stuff. 


unity main frameowkr -> convert opencv code to unity c++ plugin. 
- some code is alredy unity implementaton
- some things not
- for getting camera image
- live stream. either works. 
	- proof of concept is better to work on recordings
	- jun li has also done getting texture into unity
	- jacob was best

calibration
- need to know ideally for all camera where they are in space.
- can just measure but not accurate
- show the checkerboard
- for ecah camera get the extrinsic (position relative to board) intrinsic (lens distortion etex)

once i can talk to camer try to calibrate

if we recalibrate we can re use the old data set


from jonathan
- camera calibration not easy

c++ library easiest
