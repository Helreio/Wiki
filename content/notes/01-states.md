1. Create an application prototype to determine the state of the user while wearing Snap Spectacles 
- You must identify at least 3 states 
	- Sitting versus standing 
	- Browsing 
	- In a Conversation/Meeting 
	- Running 
	- Walking 
- You are free to discuss other states you may wish to identify with us. 
- You will demonstrate you prototype in the labs following the submission. 

2. Brainstorm information that you like to have accessible in each state, reflecting on the concepts of ubiquitous computing. 
- Document your brainstorm 
- Create one storyboard for each of 3 states 
- As a general guide we would expect documentation to be a 1-2 page pdf.
