So many people ask "what is the meaning of my life". There is no easy answer to this

Since everyone is born into this condition Nietzsche asks — "Why aren't the vast majority of people nihilistic"

the reason is bevaus when you come of age and ask these questions, historically speaking people have always had a choice between many different "true world theories"

e.g., platos world of forms. Things in the world are imperfect representations of a "ideal form". 

this implies that the world is a earthly shadow of a "real world"

nietsche would call this the true world of this true world theory


e.g., christian, earth vs afterlife. you are an eternal spirit inhabiting a temporary body. We should focus of heaven

∴ heaven is the true world of this true world theory


e.g., hinduism/buddism: a wave is a temporary manifestation of the ocean: its not separate from the ocean. In that sense we too are waves. temporary manifestation of some spirit world or the totality of the universe. individuality is an illusion, we are all one thing

this one thing is the true world


There are many more and they are all very similar. Niezsche would say these true world theories are human inventions, a common tactic used to satisfy our psycological needs. They are a solution to a universal problem. Similar to the problem of moving heavy things which everyone solved using the wheel.

The reason they have existed so long, is that we havent always been able to refute the existence of another world. 

Once everyone is aware of this Niezsche says "God is dead". He  not talking about some deity. He saying that humanity's pursuit of a true theory is dead. He's saying its becoming more difficult for humans to believe in one of these theories. Our solution to the problem dissapears. 

Nietzsche also says these theories breed complacency, e.g., god forgiving you for your sins. Every one become a "member of a herd". The code they share removes their individuality. 

Nietzsche says Envy (a sin) is a powerful force driving us to become the best version of us. It can be used as motivation. It's highly personalised, you dont envy something you dont want (?). What we are envious about can teach us about who we are.

Nietzsche says christianity, creates weakness and passivity as a virtue. 

He reccomends: dont drink alcohol: you feel good for a little while, but it's bad for you, is calorie dense, opportunity cost, monetary cost. even so: is wierd to not drink. The other pro is that it instantly (temporarily) solves all your problems. 

> "There have been two great narcotics in history: Christianity, and alcohol"

It is a trap to use alcohol in the same way as christianity. 

AA replaces alcohol with god

We have created so many excuses to drink
