Rapid Prototyping as [[Simulated Annealing]]

## Goals
- minimise time spent
- maximise information gained
	- cost of change increases with time
- help [[stakeholders]] understand ideas

## Traits of a good prototype:
- not fully complete
- easy to change/create
- retired/evolved quickly

## Insights gained from prototyping
- Feel -> Form
- Implementation -> Function
- Role -> Overall Experience
