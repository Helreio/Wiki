# SDLC
Provides overall framework for managing the systems
There are many methodologies to help guide us through this cycle
Each methodology sits on the [[Predictive adaptive spectrum]]
A very common methodology at the moment is [[Agile Development]]

## Phases
### Analysis 
^2d7976
- Lots of communication with [[Stakeholders]] 
- Gather detailed information
- define system requirements
- prioritise requirements (what is risky, what brings value to business) -> increase proability of success
- develop UI dialogs ([[Prototyping]] where the user can interact with the system)
- evaluate requirments
- review reccomendations with management

## Business process re-engineering
method of organising company
- streamline processes to be efficient and efffective
- question basic assumptions

use ICT to help with BPR 

sys analyst may find opportunites to improve processes
- any project can include components of BPR

simpler business processes -> simpler requirements -> simpler system

## Requirements
- [[Requirements]]
- [[Requirements elicitation]]
- Something the system should do 
- Some constraint the system should have
- Can be functional or non functional
- Good requirements prevent failure

## SDLC Variations
- different terminology
- change focus on people
- change speed of development
	- [[Prototyping]]
	- Rapid application development (RAD)

## Failure
main goal: Avoid project failure
- complete fail implies nothing delivered
- Types of fail
	- cost overruns
	- sw quality issues
	- missed deadlines
	- unhappy [[stakeholders]]

Suprisingly very common with large projects

reasons for fail:
