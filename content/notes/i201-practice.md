update anomaly - e.g., when a single employee is working on two projects, and we need to update their salary, it is possible to only update their salary in one location causing an update anomaly

root causes - this occired because there was redundancy within the database - the employee and his salary should only be stored in one location

how it can be solved/avoided - this can be easily avoided by normalising the database to remove redundancies.

## 3
a) business functions are things that the business *ought* to be doing (not what it is doing now), for example "accept payment from customer". each business function essentially become a fuction or a set of functions within the information system. they do not describe the who, how, or where of the function.

b) business function are typiclaly modelled using use case diagrams. in the final system they become features or a set of features
