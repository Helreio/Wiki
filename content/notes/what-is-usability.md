title: What is Usability

## 1.1 Blackboard
![300](None)
The first example of bad usability is in blackboard. Blackboard is a "web based virtual learning environment and learning management system". The issue occurs with the menu in the top right (shown below) when the window in which the user is viewing the page is smaller (either on a mobile device or a shrunk down desktop Browser).

The issue is that the menu gets hidden behind the main page when the window is smaller (shown below)
This means that when the user is using black board in a small browser window, they are unable to navigate between their courses in the intended way. This is an example of bad usability because it prevents the user from being able to use the product for its intended purpose. It is not effective, efficient nor satisfactory.


## 1.2 Sky go
![150](None)

The second example is an issue with the web application sky go. Sky go is a television streaming service. It allows users to watch on demand or live Sky TV with just an internet connection. There is a usability issue with the sign in screen on desktop browsers, which may also affect mobile and other platforms. In particular, with the error messages. On some plans, users are only allowed to use the account on one device at a time. When logging in, if another user is already signed in on another device, the login will fail. In such an event, the error message displayed alerts the user that their username or password are incorrect, not that another user is logged in.

This is an example of bad usability due to uninformative error messages. In this example, the user does not know the reason why there are unable to login. In my case, it led to me resetting the password multiple times before I realized what the actual error was.


## 1.3 Udisc
![150](None)
My third example is of the Mobile App Udisc. Udisc is a disc golf scoring app. The problem with this app occurs when in the "select players" phase of creating a new round scorecard. The user can choose to add existing players, or they can create a new player using the icon in the top right of the page. The issue is that after adding a new player and returning to the select players screen, the new player is not visible. To make the new player visible, the user somehow reload the page, without a reload button. One way is to switch from the 'frequent' tab to the 'recent' or the 'all' tab. This will reload the page and the added player will appear in all tabs.

It was hard to show this with just screenshots, so I recorded a GIF and uploaded to Imgur [https://i.imgur.com/VuXshdZ.gif](https://i.imgur.com/VuXshdZ.gif)


## 1.4 Epomaker
![300](None)
My final example of bad usability is the Epomaker website. This is a mechanical keyboard ecommerce site. On loading the create an account page, a cookies pop obscured behind the floating 'rewards' button appears. The final line of the message and the bottom left portion of the pop-up is not visible. When I saw this, I thought there might be an option to configure my cookie settings hidden behind the floating button. I didn't want to allow the site to use cookie's that weren't strictly necessary. So I just ignored the pop-up and finished creating my account while the pop-up was obscuring the bottom left of the page. This is bad usability because the pop blocked me from being able to create an account as easily as I could have.


## 1.5 NZ Herald
Finally I have an example of a web app that is usable, but has a bad user experience. This app is NZ Herald. Upon loading the page, the user is faced with a screen that is at least 75% advertisements. The app still has good usability as the user can easily scroll down which hides most of the ads, so there are only the strips on the sides. However, the initial loading page is crammed full of advertisements. This bombardment of ads makes the site appear unprofessional, and untrustworthy, despite the "website of the year" stub. This degradation of trust contributes to a bad user experience, despite the overall usability.
