Internet protocols are sets of rules that enable communication and data exchange across the internet. There are many types of internet protocols for different purposes and functions. Here are some examples of common internet protocols:

-   TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. [This is the basic protocol that defines how data packets are transmitted and routed over the internet](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/types-of-internet-protocol)[1](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/types-of-internet-protocol)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-internet-protocols/).
-   SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. [This protocol is used for sending and receiving email messages over the internet](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/types-of-internet-protocol)[1](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/types-of-internet-protocol)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-internet-protocols/).
-   FTP: File Transfer Protocol. [This protocol is used for transferring files between computers over the internet](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/types-of-internet-protocol)[1](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/types-of-internet-protocol)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-internet-protocols/).

-   DNS: Domain Name System. [This protocol is used for translating domain names into IP addresses, which are easier for computers to understand](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/feature/12-common-network-protocols-and-their-functions-explained)[3](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/feature/12-common-network-protocols-and-their-functions-explained).

These are some examples of internet protocols that you may encounter or use on a daily basis. You can learn more about each protocol by reading their specifications or tutorials online
