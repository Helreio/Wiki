# News
- kiwis urged to get new passwords by government cybersecurity agency (big password energy)
- ukraine cyber agency reports cyber attack surge
- plymouth households hit by clarion housing cyber attack
- facebook "unintentionally uploaded" 1.5 million peoles email contacts without their consent

# Threats
events are circumstances that has the potential (risk) to adversely affect assets (reducing their value)
- e.g., possibility of text messages stop working -> phone loses value

# Attack
intentional or unintentional (e.g., lightning) acts that can damage or compromise assets.
- the actual act of attacking
- can be passive attack: e.g., stumble accross information accidentaly

# Exploits
- the techniques used

# Vulnerabilities
- the potential weaknesses in assets or in their defensive control systems
- e.g., try to find weakpoints in a castle

# Arms race
security is a never ending arms race. Security is improving but so are the number of potential exploits

# 12 groups of threats
![](https://i.imgur.com/d5i1wpA.png)

## Intellectual property
- creation ownership and control of original ideas
- common breaches include software priracy
- two organisatons investigate software abuse
	- software and information industry association (SIIA)
	- business software alliance (BSA)
- enforcement of copyright laws has been attempted with technical security mechanisms (e.g., watermark, you need an account, must register the software, etc)

## deviations in quality of service
- when a product is not delivered as expected
- info systems depend of successful operation of many interdependent support systems
- internet, communications, power irregularities, all affect the availability of information systems
- internet:
	- ISP failures can considerably undermine the availability of information
	- outsourced web hosting assumes responsibility for all internet service as well as for the hardware and the web site operaing system software. 
	- terms of service ensure that these services are guaranteed
- communication and other provider service issues include
	- other untilities: telephone, water, wastewater, garbage collection
	- these all affect the companies ability to function
- power irregularities
	- pwer exess, shortages, losses
	- sensitive equipment vulnerable to and easily damaged by fluctuations
	- controls can be applied to manage power quality e.g., UPS

## espionage or trespass 
- unauthorized attempts to gain illegal access to information
- competitive intelligence vs industrial espionage vs cyber terrorism
- shoulder surfing 
- controls mark the virtual boundaries of an organisations
	- controls oftentimes let trespassers know they are encroaching on an organizations cyberspace
	- hackers use skill, guile, or fraud, to bypass controls protecting others information
		- expert
			- develop scripts and exploits
			- master of many skills
			- of create software (malware etc) and share with others
			- minority
		- novice
			- script kiddies
			- more common
			- use scripts written by experts
			- do not understand the systems the are hacking
			- packet monkeys: script kiddies that use worms to overload systems
		- cracker
			- cracks or removes software protections designed to precent unauthorized duplication
			- also crack passwords
		- phreaker
			- hacks the public telephone system to make free calls or disrupt services
			- more specific
- also includes password attacks
	- brute force- tried all possible combinations
	- dictionary - include information related to the target user
	- rainbow tables - a hacker with access to encrypted password, they can find the corresponding plaintext in a dataset called a rainbow table
	- social engineering - e.g., attacks as posing at IT professionals to gain access toa systems information (normally by contacting other employees)

# Forces of nature
- fire, flood, lightening, earthquake, eruptions, etc.
- can use controls to protect against these
- very dynamic
- unpredicatble

# Human errors or failure
- actions performed without malicious intent or ignorance (by an authorised user)
- inexperience
- improper training
- incorrect assumptions
- employees are among the greatest threats to an organisations data
- e.g, 
	- accidental deletion
	- revelation of classified data
	- entry or erroneous data
	- storage in unprotected areas
	- failure to protect information
- can be prevented with training, ongoing awareness activites, and controls

# Social engineering
- using social skills to convince people to reveal access credentials or other valuable information to an attacker
- used for a broad range of malicious activities through human interactions

Developing trust if a powerful technique in social engineering
- people are naturally helpful and trusting
- ask during seemingly innocent conversations
	- slowly ask for increasingly imprtant information
- lean company lingo, names of people, names, servers etc
- cause a problem and subsequently offer your help to fix it
- talk negatively about common enemy
- talk positively about common hero

Inducing strong emotions
- you won a prize etc
- excitement 
- fear
- confusion

information overload technique
- reduce targets ability to sctrutinize arguments proposed by attacker
- trigger by
	- providing a lot of information
	- providing arguments from an unexpected angle, whicih forces the victim to analyse the situation from a new perspective which requires additional mental processing


Reciprocation
- technique that exploits our tendency to return a favour
- even if first favour was not requested
- even if the return favour is more valuable
- double disagreement
	- if the attacker created a double disagreement and gives in one, the victim will have the tendency to ive in the other
- expectation
	- if the victim is requested to give the first favour, they will believe that the attacker becomes a future ally

tendency to obey authority
- milgram experiement

dont be a commitment creep
- people have a tendency to follow commitments even when is might be unwise

information exortion is the practive of requesting a ransom for your valuable information
- ransomware

# Attacks
represent intentional or unintentional acts that can damage or compromise assets
- range from petty to vandalism to organized sabotage
- defacing
- threats are rising
- cyberterrorism/warfare is much more sinister form of hacking
