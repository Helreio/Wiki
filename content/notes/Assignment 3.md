# Assignment 3

**Deadline: Friday 27th of May 2022, 5pm via Blackboard (35% of final mark)**

## 1 Project: Prototypical Mobile App Development
### 1.1 Aim
- conecptual design and prototypical implementation of a application for mobile devices
- Usage of an iterative development model increasing the fidelity of the developed prototype
- Conduct brainstorming, develop personas and scenarios, create storyboard, create low fidelity prototypes (explore alternatives), informal evaluation, create high fidelity prototypes

### 1.2 Deadlines
- Friday 8th of April: Email to Jonthan (sutjo752@student.otago.ac.nz) to indicate group/ indivdual work and preliminary topic idea
- Friday 27th of May: Final recorded presentation and additional material summarising the prototypical mobile App development

### 1.3 Brainstorming:
- Explore user interface alternatives and compare against existing products similar to your app (or most similar apps)
- Document process: E.g. what are the different ideas, alternatives developed and existing solutions, what was the reason the choosing the winning idea
	- Keep it short, make use of visual documentation (e.g. drawings, photos, Post-Its) and support it with text, mindmap(s) can me usefull to document brainstorming
	- Documentation needs to provide evidence that you a) considered existing solutions (needfinding) and b) explored different alternatives
	
### 1.4 Personas and Scenarios:
- Conceptually develop personas and scenarios (at least two)
- Document final personas (also considering different type of personas) and scenarios
- Keep it short and see examples in the lectures for guidance

### 1.5 Storyboard:
- Develop a visual storyboard out of your scenario description
- See lecture on storyboards for tricks on developing a short and concise storyboard
- Digital storyboard or free hand sketch are both fine

### 1.6 Low fidelity prototypes:
- Develop low fidelity prototypes for your envisioned app using techniques explained in the lecture (paper-based prototypes)
- We expect 6-10 “screens” that should be prototypically developed
- Explore alternatives for the interface and document all (photos are ok when using pen-based sketches)
- Consider and document the flow within the app (relation and pathways between different screens)

### 1.7 Document design decisions / informal evaluation
- Which of the ideas from the different low fidelity prototypes did or did not work
- Document the identified issues by linking them to the design heuristics and mention the proposed solution(s)
- E.g. one aspect from one prototype worked better than in the alternative prototype because there was an issue with “Consistency”….

### 1.8 High fidelity prototype:
- Develop a high fidelity prototype from the knowledge gained with your low fidelity prototype
- Create the higher fidelity prototype by choosing a method (e.g. could be prototype toolkits such as Balsamiq, Adobe XD, …, some of them have a free trial period you are not expected to buy those, could be template based approaches using images of UI elements, …)
- Consider which interface elements you use because of size constraints within a mobile interface
- Outline the flow within the app (relation and pathways between different screens)
- Document using screenshots etc.

### 1.9 Submission:
- ~7min presentation slides with max. 7 slides (Powerpoint, Keynote, or Pdf) summarising the key aspects of your prototypical development
	- Professional look: Less text more graphics, illustrations, and other media material (video?)
	- This presentation is no advertisement or sales pitch but a summary of the work you did with some key insights you learned along the way
	- Record your presentation (slides and with audio, video optional), we recommend Zoom for doing this
- Submit the recording of your presentation
- Submit all material (e.g. more detailed storyboards, alternatives explored, paper-based prototypes not covered in the presentation, full high level prototypes)
- Deadline: Friday 27th of May 2022, 5pm via Blackboard (35% of final mark)
