## Summary
### Overview
I was able to find only 7 apps with similar functionality to what I am planning. Of these none 5 were for skateboarding 2 for other sports and zero for snowboarding. 
### Functionality of the apps
These 7 apps all had varying degreee of complexity. Some were just simple customizable trick generators, while others were fully fledged coaching and goal tracking apps with community features and other extras. Although I am not planning to make large complicated app, I can still draw from them for guidance as most of them did have a trick generator. 

Aesthetic/style of the apps


Conclusion


## Skate Dice
Skate dice was one of the most intresting of the apps I found. I had a very unique approach using a "skate the phone" gesture to "roll" the dice. However it has a paywall for premium features such as more tricks, settings, and a "tricktionary".  From what I was able to use I think is was the most simple and intuitive apps. It also had an aesthetic that fit the culture of the sport. All these features combined made it very enjoyable to use. 

#### How does this app inform mine
- Keep design simple
- Maybe incorporate some gestures
- Consider using an aesthetic wich matches the culture/sport

## Skate tricks

This app is a much more fully featured solution. It is oriented towards learning skateboarding, and keeping track of you progress while doing it. It also has a built in trick generator, and game of skate. One of the most unique features it had that the other apps didn't was a trick of the day. This is one of the core features I want to include in my app.
