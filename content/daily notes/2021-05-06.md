I am grateful for:

1. Benjie, Claire, Rem, and Lea.
2. The things that FS pointed at as my achievements, but which I don't usually realize or remember: working a few days only a month, having routines, writing prose well.
3. Just being alive and writing this right now.

"I am admired by people important to me."

Amazing

- Watched Master of None
- Watched Wild, Wild Country
- Date with Lea (burgers and halo-halo) at balit-bitin, surrounded by dogs.
- Walked to Maulawin bridge
