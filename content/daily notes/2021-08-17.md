I am grateful for:

1. The silence that the absence of social media creates.
2. Champy sitting beside me right now.
3. The present moment.

"My purpose is to live in the Now."

Amazing

- My day was really mostly silent. I can hear myself in solitude.
- I journaled about connecting with an audience.
- I continued reading about emotons.
- I translated [[Kaliskis na Ulap â€” Mga Salin#08-17-1851 Baha ng buhay]]
- First time to get inside Olivarez Plaza and at Mr. DIY.
- Continued Money Heist.
- Saw lots of people I know while walking: Marky and Ange, Gelai, Kisig and Angel.
