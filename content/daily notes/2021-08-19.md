I am grateful for:

1. Being able to fix my table and learning how to use a barena.
2. Zettelkasten
3. People who are exemplars, my models, my heroes.

"I am an independent researcher and artist."

Amazing

- I journaled about my life work and projects.
- I started fixing my reading inbox.
- Continued watching Money Heist.
- Walked around UP.
