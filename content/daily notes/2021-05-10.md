I am grateful for:

1. This quiet morning. Not perfect but still delightful.
2. Scribendi. Look, I am able to earn 40k from it in just 5 days of work (or make that 6 days to account for the overtime that is typical of my monthly work). That is unfound of. I am able to semi-retire at this age and do what I want to do. I need to show my appreciation to this work by being patient with it and with my mistakes and find ways to improve as an editor.
3. That really moving film about Alec Soth. I used to dream I could find modern-day Thoreaus. Well, I have found one. Make that two with Craig Mod.

"I am intentional and wise with my financial life and work."

Amazing

- I finally understood how to track investments vis a vis income and expenses.
- I learned basic spreadsheet skills.
- Walked from Baybayin to Mayondon via Malinta then home.
- I started watching Cristianâ€™s film.
