I am grateful for:

1. Diwa for responding well to my message.
2. Craig Mod's advice to write and read for the next three hours, measuring success through time spent with archetypes, and the potential use of residencies.
3. Ate Daisy for remembering me the other day when Rein celebrated her birthday.

"I am a writer. I write and learn writing through reading, in the morning."

Amazing

- I tried looking for Filipino writers in English and discovered Luis Francia and his book The Eye of the Fish. I started reading it.
- I started writing a write up about HEAL.
- I cooked ginisang munggo for the first time.
- I gave Claire a taste of my dish for the first time.
- I walked in UP to buy yogurt.
- I finished my Weekly Review.
- I finished my Monthly Financial Review.
- I listened to Craig Mod's office hours on how to be a better writer and listed the writers who have inspired him.
