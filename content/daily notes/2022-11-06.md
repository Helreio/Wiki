## I am grateful for:
1. Bonding with Benjie while walking at the Makiling Botanical Garden.
2. Witnessing and supporting Claire in her grieving process yesterday as she walks in the forest and descends down the creek.
3. Being able to send Lea off to her event safely.

## Affirmation

"I will make the most of this day."
