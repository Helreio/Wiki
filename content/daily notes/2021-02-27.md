I am grateful for:

1. Learning something from my experience (mistake) with negotiating the internet at my new house. I could have handled it better if I wasn't that distrustful of people. Perhaps I did the right think by following my tendencies, but I also know within me that I can abuse this tendency to distrust if I don't catch myself.
2. Claire and Diwa for making my day colorful yesterday. Getting to know Diwa more was amazing. Her asking me about my day job and what I want to manifest was also refreshing. I really am around the right people. I just have to take advantage of that.
3. People, expressing their desire to help. The world is not lost.
