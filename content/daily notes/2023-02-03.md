## I am grateful for:
1. Arriving home safely here at Cablong yesterday.
2. Seeing my sister happy, inspired, and full of life.
3. The ideas that came to me yesterday during the walk about how I could improve my gig search.

## Affirmation

"I live in the present moment. Here, everything is okay. There is nothing to worry about."

## Review

In my journal, I wrote about how people who need my example could come and find me and what it means to live well.

I started and finished writing the [[2023-01 Monthly report]].

While having lunch, I watched Cobra Kai.

I finished SEP 251.

I played Underlords.

I traveled to Binmaley to meet Cams and Migs.

Cams, Migs, Tito Francis, and I drove to Lingayen to use the baywalk to get to Binmaley. There were too much people. We decided not to proceed to the kalutan and just had dinner at Cafe Amaris.

At Cafe Amaris we each ate dinner while talking about the past. We talked about Migs' poop story during elementary.

We went back to the house at Naguilayan where we met Tita Elsie, Glenda, and Loida (?). We had photos, then we proceeded at Kuya Nonong's house where we drank some liquor and talked about childhood trauma, the current state of our families, and health.

We slept around 12:30 am.
