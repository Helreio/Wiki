I am grateful for:

1. The nine more days I have to work on my passions and life in general before shifting to sustenance mode once again.
2. The ten years that I had since my depressive episode. I learned a lot. I went through ups and downs. But it was an amazing ride over all.
3. The fermented foods I consumed yesterday. I feel like my issues did improved. I hope this continues.
