## I am grateful for:
1. The discovery call with Benjie and Joji last night. I learned more about them not just as friends but two people who are really trying to make a dent to the universe.
2. Supporting Maui at this time. I know that much of this is free work, but I know that it will go far when we do work together.
3. Lea

## Affirmation
