I am grateful for:

1. This breathing space of solitude.
2. Seeing Nasugbu the past two days.
3. Finding some hope in the middle of everything that is happening to me right now.

"I can provide my best editing in the coming days."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about poetry and photography and how they relate to appreciation of beauty and excellence.

I continued reading Transcend, the entire purpose chapter.

## Projects

### Scribendi improvement

I reviewed the QA results from the latest manual check.

I also started reading the QA instructions. I learned that most of my QA scores are really taken from grammar and mechanics (about 60%). And this is the reason why I failed the previous test. I didn't have Grammarly and the Scribendi toolbar to help me out.

## Others

- I walked at UP (Viado). There were lots of evening exercise people.
- Watched Narcos.
- Watched Shawshank Redemption with Lea.
