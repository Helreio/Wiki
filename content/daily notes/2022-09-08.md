## I am grateful for:
1. The arrival of my Scribendi earnings yesterday.
2. Finally on the final steps of insuring myself.
3. A good night sleep. Feeling really good. Being more positive now than yesterday.

## Affirmation

"I will be happier today."

## Review

### Projects

- Held our first budget date as a couple at Dalcielo.
- Presented my financial report for the first week of September.
- We were able to finalize our couple fund. I tweaked it a bit to reflect our reality.
- I was able to finalize my personal monthly budget. I did this by going back to my credit card statements and online purchases via Shopee and Lazada.
- Discovered that we can have a cheaper foreign trip to destinations like Bali.

### Others
