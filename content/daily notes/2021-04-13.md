I am grateful for:

1. Seeing Via talk that way. Being called Tito Vince. That's just an amazing feeling.
2. Being able to rewrite my past via the About page and learning about my reactions.
3. A new free day to use for what matters to me.

"I am a fortunate person to have this much time. I will use it for my advantage."

Amazing

- I continued engaging with Pinoy Stoics and got really good responses.
- I journaled about my need to connect with family members, reflecting on my current mission work (writing a new About page), and how I think James Clear is applying zettelkasten.
- I rewrote my About page using Lea's feedback, notes from my recent journal entries, and new ideas.
- I started my audience research.
