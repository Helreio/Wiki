I am grateful for:

1. Tita Mona for being considerate and sensitive enough to ask me if she is making too much noise. I have never been asked that by a neighbor, and considering that I am particularly sensitive with noise, this is a welcome gesture.
2. Finally finishing my Scribendi work. I have another 25 days again in my disposal to use to better my life. I will be more intentional with it.
3. Lea, for being in my life, for making me feel less alone here in LB.

To do
