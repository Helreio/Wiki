## I am grateful for:
1. My feet. Healthy enough to bring around and feel the outdoors.
2. My eyes through which I can see the world, read words, and enjoy all the pleasures of life.
3. My hands with which I could do work, touch my loved ones, embrace them, and help people in need.

## Affirmation

"I have a healthy body that allows me to enjoy a happy and meaningful life."
