I am grateful for:

1. Being with Lea right now. This place is much better when I share it with someone, especially Lea. If things all go well, which I feel like it will, and I will still be staying here, it will be a nice place to start out with her.
2. This view I have outside. It’s much better when the windows are open this way. I feel closer with the trees.
3. Yesterday. It was really a fun day

To do

- [x] PS How I Cured My Silent Reflux
- [ ] Call Kuya Randy about the faucet and the doorknob for the working room.
- [x] Calculate how much to send Rem and Claire.
- [ ] Calculate Lea’s debt or my debt to Lea.

Amazing

- PS How I Cured My Silent Reflux.
- Bought yogurt with Lea at Milka Krem.
- Worked out plans for the cats’ health.
- Bought nutritional yeast at Satya Graha.
- Went to Aina to buy groceries. Carmela, possibly one of the owners, know me by name. They are so friendly.
- Ate atsara with my dinner and yogurt after the meal. I felt no reflux symptoms. It was the oily pancit canton I ate during lunch which triggered me a while ago. Or possibly, the fact that I only ate fruit in the morning.

Tomorrow

- Create a document to track your progress while applying How I Cured My Silent Reflux.
- Continue writing notes from How to Take Smart Notes.
- Continue reading YMOYL.
- Fill up new appointment form for cats.
