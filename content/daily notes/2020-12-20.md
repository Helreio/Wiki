   - I am grateful for:
      - Feeling calm. Remembering that this cc card fraud problem is a stoic challenge. My emotions are in tact right now. I am grateful for that.
      - Spending a breakfast with my parents. It is something I enjoy especially because I don't get the chance to join them in breakfast often.
      - Something I'm looking forward to: Migs coming home tomorrow, which means bonding with real people in real life.
