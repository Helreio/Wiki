## I am grateful for:
1. Having two places where I could stay in during a challenging stretch like this, and being more comfortable because of it.
2. That walk from SM to City Mall yesterday, which made me even appreciate walking even more.
3. Being well-rested and feeling good. Excited to continue my day.

## Affirmation

"I am blessed to have Lea's family and be integrated in it."

## Review
### Studies

I journaled about how difficult it is to write, but I still do it.

I continued processing my Ultralearning notes.

I created the following notes:
- [[Strategy]]
- [[Use the law of diminishing returns and the 10 percent rule to approximate how long a metalearning project should be]]
- [[Apply benchmarking and emphasizing-excluding to know how to learn effectively]]
- [[Procedures]]
- [[Concepts]]
- [[Identify concepts, facts, and procedures to understand the knowledge structure of a subject]]
- [[Analyze concepts, facts, and procedures to identify bottlenecks in your learning project]]
- [[Articulate your motivation for learning to help you focus on what matters]]

### Writing

Published Lilim 03(05). Lea read it and gave me some valuable feedback.

### Photography

Tried learning split image in IG.

### Projects

### Others

- I celebrated Father's day with Lea and her family.
- Had a fun storytelling convo with Tita last night and with Lipote wine to boot.
