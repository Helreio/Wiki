I am grateful for:

1. Bevs for inviting me to climb Mt. Makiling with them.
2. Sitting down on the grass yesterday after a walk to batis.
3. Champy being more malambing now.

"I am not afraid of the end. I am in touch with my mortality."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about how my initial obsession with Ginhawa might be explained by my desire to transcend (i.e., to experience peak experiences and other transcendental experiences). I processed a diary entry that contains advice about how I can deepen my contemplative practice.

I read Transcend’s Afterword. I finished listening to the interview with SBK at Rich Roll’s podcast. I also listened to CM’s interview ([https://www.japantimes.co.jp/podcast/walking-through-japan](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/podcast/walking-through-japan/?utm_source=pocket_mylist)) and AM's video update on his independent research funding via Patreon ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4IgqGO7k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kB4IgqGO7k))

## Projects

### iCloud Photos

I started processing my photos, halving 2021. I felt my photographer’s eye being alive again. I edited the photo I took of the kapok and shared a post on social media, which did well.

## Others

- After raining all day, I walked around Freedom Park at UP from 6 pm to 7:30 pm.
- I continued watching Narcos.
