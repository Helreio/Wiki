## I am grateful for:
1. Walden
2. Better sleep last night
3. The words that has kept me company over the years

## Affirmation

"I search for quiet to write and commune with myself."

## Review

Went to SM Calamba to buy a pair of sandals and some clothes with Lea.

Lunch at Pizza Hut. Pizza was good. Service was not.

Went to Siento to read Walden.

Walked to Forestry.

Underlords.

Helped Claire have a custom email through her domain name. I used this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXe6tSg78Jw&t=822s
