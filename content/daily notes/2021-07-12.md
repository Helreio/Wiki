I am grateful for:

1. The opportunity to be present and practice tolerance during the clearing of Diwa's place.
2. Good food, good friends, and good conversations. I particularly like the kung fu conversation.
3. Lilim 11 and the insight on what kind of writing I actually enjoy creating.

"I am intentional."

Amazing

- Worked on Thoreau translations.
- Walked at the path at Rosemary.
- Started watching Kingdom.
