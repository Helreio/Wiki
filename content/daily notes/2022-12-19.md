## I am grateful for:
1. Agreeing to go with Lea at the Tribe event and not blowing it off just because of some emotional issues.
2. Meeting new friends: Rene, Kayeh, and Jen.
3. Talking with Beth and JA again and hearing their current processes.

## Affirmation

"I have the capability to be very skilled on something and offer that in exchange for freedom."

## Review

I journaled about my reflections from the South Tribe Xmas Party and Year-End Meetup. I then used the I Ching to generate new ideas about the question: "Should I now focus on learning email copywriting?" 

Lea and I watched Dash and Lily while having lunch.

I finished sending my responses to Mini's latest questions about the translation.

I send a message to Coach Airon.

While having merienda, I continued watching REF module 2 and finished the first video.

I started pruning my email for weekly review.

I played ML and reached Mythic for the first time ever.

I then walked to Forestry.

In the evening, I had dinner by myself while continuing to watch The Tree of Life.

I then checked out the Reader app of Readwise.
