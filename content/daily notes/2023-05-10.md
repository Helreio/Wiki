## Review

We walked to Agapita to buy food for lunch and dinner.

I continued reading The Elements of Style.

We had lunch while watching Transatlantic.

I edited my contracts for Ili and Candent and sent them.

I created a project dashboard for Ili via Trello, created a Loom video explaining the dashboard, and wrote and sent a welcome email.

I played Underlords.

I walked Data–Sierra Madre–Onyx–Ruby–Velasco–Narra–Lantican–Pancho–Freedom Park–Royal Palm–Lopez.

We had dinner.

I contacted Shopify support to ask for an explanation regarding slow propagation of nameservers.

I created a project board, Loom video, and welcome email for Candent.

I played Underlords then prepared to sleep.
