I am grateful for:

1. Finally instituting a financial system for Lea. I am excited to see what could come from this.
2. Realization that I could pursue two areas of exploration: walking and independent thinking.
3. This opportunity to review the past month and enrich its meaning.

"I am living a fulfilling life."

## Reviews

### Studies

I journaled about how I can incorporate my top character strengths and sources of self-actualization into my life work.

I continued reading Transcend Chapter on Theory Z. I was reminded of the nature of transcenders - that they are self-actualizers but more. They can be less psychologically healthy than the self-actualizers because they can be frustrated with the world after seeing what is possible through peak experiences.

## Others

Finished watching Narcos season 2.

I rode Jacob's bike to buy lechon manok. I saw an accident along the way. Got me in touch with mortality.

Game night with the gang.
