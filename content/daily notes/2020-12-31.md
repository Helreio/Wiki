I am grateful for:

- Maui and her poem for me. I just feel amazed about how she sees how I show up. I am slowly creating an image in front of people. I don't know yet if this is good or not. But I am grateful for its effect on people.
- Tungkomunidad. The best community I have right now.
- Froi's song, Cris' tune, Benjie's zentangle poem, and everyone else's sharings.
