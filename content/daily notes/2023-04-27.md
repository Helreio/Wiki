## Review

I had lunch while finishing a Peaky Blinders episode.

I attended Diwa's Sagana Screenwriting Playshop. She's a cool facilitator and I was happy to experience my first exposure to screenwriting. It also gave me a taste of what a writing workshop might be and made me realized I need to work more on empathetic listening especially when listening to someone else's creative work. I also mer Deborah Lemuel.

I attended Sounds, Scents, and Stories. While listening to Embi's sound, watching the dance of the candle flame, and smelling the scent of the melting oil, I remembered old Filipino fantasy films and the night when Mama and Papa went to Baguio for a few days for Mama's goiter operation, leaving me and my sisters to Nanay (Mama's mother) in the middle of a storm, unprepared, brown out.

Lea and I had dinner at Chadiz Pizza and ate Burger Pizza (superb!).

At home, I played some Underlords before preparing to sleep.
