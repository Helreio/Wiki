## I am grateful for:
1. The little cute, curious, and loving kitty we were gifted with.
2. Juwa agreeing to visit our cats like they always do.
3. The opportunity to see and be with my family again.

## Affirmation

"Life is hard but full of possibilities."

## Review

Traveled to Pangasinan.

Browsed Substack for interesting philosophy-related newsletters.
Subscribed to:
- Mind OS
- Photo Meditations
- Under the Net
I read all the available posts under Under the Net by the philosopher Kieran Setiya.
Checked his new book *Life is Hard*.
Saw his book recommendation *Rotten Reviews Redux*.

Also continued reading *Living Philosophy* and finished Chapter 5 (Melville: What Philosophers Learn at Sea).

Papa fetched us using the Vios and I was reunited with my family.
