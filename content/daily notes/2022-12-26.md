## I am grateful for:

1. Hearing Lea become more empowered in how she talks about herself and her own boundaries.
2. This feeling that I am slowly falling into this role, this identity of living an independent and creative life.
3. The conversation I had with Lea about the mind and the self last night. It helped me clarify my own beliefs about the self.

## Affirmation

"I will make significant progress today on reviewing my ideas about LMS and preparing for Lea's ground level system and our annual review."

## Review

I journaled about some action steps for establishing Lea's LMS and preparing for our first session.

I transfered my initial journal entry about [[A book about Los Ba√±os]] to my forest garden.

Lea and I tried watching I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson while having lunch.

I created a Trello board for the LMS and OBM project with Lea. I remembered the GTD workbook and decided to review it to pattern the program to it.

I did a weekly review.

I did a relatively shorter walk at UP. When I went home, Lea and I ate fried siomai again. After dinner, we watched Glass Onion.
