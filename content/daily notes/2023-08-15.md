## I am grateful for:
1. Realizing two things regarding the direction of my writing: 1. I want to focus on the craft of writing philosophical lyrical essays and 2. I want to write in contemporary Pangasinan.
2. This quiet, cloudy morning for introspection and writing.
3. Being alive today.

## Affirmation

"I am a lyrical essayist."

## Review

Continued reading [[thoughts/refusing heaven by jack gilbert|Refusing Heaven by Jack Gilbert]].

I started looking for articles to read about the lyric essay. I recorded my research on the note [[thoughts/lyric essay|lyric essay]].

Lunch + Umbrella Academy

I continued studying the lyric essay. Two essays I love about lyric essays:
- Writing from the Margins by Zoë Bossiere and Erica Trabold
- What's Missing Here? by Julie Marie Wade

I started playing around writing my own lyric essay with [[Komón.canvas|Komón]].
