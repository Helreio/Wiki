I am grateful for:

1. Fitz Villafuerte's videos convincing me to pull the trigger in investing my money.
2. Taking that next step in nurturing my relationship with Diwa (talking to her by myself).
3. Lea, applying at Rarejob.

To do

- [x] Research what other ETFs to invest to.
- [x] Add Cablong address at Shopee.
- [x] Buy Vitality dog food for the dogs and have it delivered to Cablong.

“I am connected to my creative self.”

Amazing

- Deposited more funds to my eToro account.
- Continued summarizing How I Cured My Silent Reflux
- Talked to Lea about my past “love” stories.
