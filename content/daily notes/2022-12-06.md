## I am grateful for:

1. Bonding with Migs, Tito Bobby, and Tito Francis at Bali Bali last night while enjoying live music and sea breeze. The food wasn't bad as well.
2. Everything I learned from talking with Tito Bobby. He made me want to watch Narcos Mexico to learn about El Chapo. I also kinda want to watch Lenox Hill and Migration Nation.
3. The land they bought in Banaoang. It gives me something to consider, a place I might call home one day.

## Affirmation

"Life is good. Life is good."

## Review

I had breakfast at Tita Vicky. We had campis. Then Tito Bob and I went to CSI Lucao. We sat for a while to drink coffee and hot choco. The hot choco was really bad.

Then we went to the Department Store to buy shoes and white long sleeve. Tito Bob bought me a black Merrell shoes. Then, Tito Bob went to the souvenir shop to buy a shirt. We then rode a jeep to Downtown.

We got off and rode a jeep to Villa Sta. Barbara. We got off Banaoang and walked to the land.

We stayed there for about 30 minutes. I really like the kubo under the bamboos and the fact that I could easily see the river.

We went home to Cablong to have lunch. The basasong was delicious.

In the afternoon, I walked at Carusocan then at Maronong-Botao road under a bright full moon moonlight.

I had dinner while watching Derry Girls.

I walked again after dinner but stood up in front of the field near the entrance to Garcia Street, looking at the constellations until 9 pm.

I sent responses to the TLTD survey and read some newsletters. I learned about [Tom Philips](https://www.tomphillips.co.uk/humument). I watched a [video by Matt White about creative spark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo6m9VeBWO4). I learned about the [Inner Compass Exchange](https://exchange.theinnercompass.org/).

I consulted the I Ching for the best time to propose and it said that I should focus on finding work first.

I talked with Lea before lying down to bed.
