## I am grateful for:
1. Getting a deposit from Candent, a sign of their trust.
2. Spending all those hours with Benjie and Joji, seeing and experiencing their life.
3. This day. An opportunity to learn writing once more and move my projects.

## Affirmation

"I am more than capable of delivering what I promised to deliver."
