## Review

While having lunch, Lea and I watched an episode of Never Have I Ever.

After the episode, we walked to Grove via Raymundo Gate, withdrawn money, searched for dental materials, and bought merienda.

Upon arriving home, we waited for Doc Ortiz to arrive.

Doc Ortiz attended to Champy. She removed three remaining molars and an impacted tooth outgrowth.

After Doc Ortiz left, I played Underlords, then went for another walk.

I bought Champy's medicines then walked at Lopez–Ela–Dawis–Aglibut–Velasco.

When I arrived, Lea and I had dinner while watching more NHIE episodes.

After dinner, I continued working on my monthly review then I played Underlords before sleepig.
