I am grateful for:

1. Finishing my Scribendi work for this month, earning more than 40k, and freeing myself up for the next 25 days.
2. Finally being able to work on the projects and areas that I care about.
3. Watching Soul. It reminded me of my reason for living—and that is simply to live every single moment of it like it is my last.
