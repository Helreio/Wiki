## I am grateful for:
1. Arriving in LB safely and fairly easily.
2. Meeting my friends.
3. Last night's walk.

## Affirmation

"I dedicate my life to examining it."

## Field notes

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I continued reading Walden.

### Writing

I wrote Lilim 03(07), edited it, and published it just all in a day.

### Photography

I chose some photos featuring the trolleys and the railroad at San Jose, Lopez, Quezon, then edited them. I didn't feel that confident on my edits, but I got good feedback from Tina, Maui, and Rom (all artists, which says a lot to me!).

### Walking

I walked briefly at Ela–Oñate–Aglibut–Royal Palm–Carabao Park.

### Projects

### Others

- Started watching Acapulco.
