## I am grateful for:
1. This day. Entirely my own. Entirely by myself.
2. The tasty food last night.
3. Being able to release Uman and learning from it.

## Affirmation

"I can articulate my needs clearly and compassionately."

## Review
### Studies

Walked at UP. Observed the Molawin creek under the bridge at Royal Palm Avenue. Is it the neverending bridge? Then observed some red bugs around the Makiling Gallery. I then walked to batis to observe falling leaves and read A Pilgrim.

### Projects

**Book Sale**

Sold some books to Rem, worth P750.

### Others

- Sent a message to Lea. Will have to talk soon.
- Watched I Lost My Body (5/5).
