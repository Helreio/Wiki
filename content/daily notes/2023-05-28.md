## I am grateful for:
1. The dining table arriving and me figuring out how to build it by myself. It just makes everything look better.
2. A productive writing session yesterday. I was able to rewrite the essay better.
3. The Sunday morning walk we took a while ago, seeing people, talking to them, finding what we need.

## Affirmation

"There are many ways to make my days more interesting and my life happier. I can be happier."
