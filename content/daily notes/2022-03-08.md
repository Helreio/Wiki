I am grateful for:

1. Talking to Mama and Papa last night and knowing that they are all okay.
2. This truly free day of solitude.
3. My conversation last night with Lea about purpose and our favorite dates.

"I live my life humorously."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled some thoughts about life’s meaninglessness.

I converted my literature notes from the last chapter of What Does This All Mean? Into writing prompts (permanent notes to be).

I wrote a very fruitful note on the relationship of nihilism and approaching life with humor. While writing it, I re-read Austin Kleon’s article on The Comedy of Survival book.

I continued reading the encyclopedia entry on the meaning of life. I encountered this argument against hedonism called the “experience machine”, which is a thought experiment about a machine that one plugs into and experiences happiness non-stop. According to the experiment, there are viable reasons not to plug into the machine, and these reasons include the fact that the need for meaning is different from the need for happiness and that happiness cannot provide the need for meaning. This argues that happiness cannot be the ultimate goal. But perhaps there is no ultimate goal.
