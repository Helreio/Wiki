I am grateful for:

1. Maui for thinking about me.
2. Finishing my sustenance work in four days.
3. The 27 days of freedom I will be using in the coming days.

"I can make myself happier in the 27 days."

# Review

## Studies

Listened to Thich Nhat Hanhâ€™s interview in The Science of Well-being. Some of the best points I heard:

- We shouldn't aspire for the eradication of suffering. We need suffering to learn how to be better human beings.
- Understanding leads to compassion, which leads to happiness.
- Always ask yourself, what is the suffering of the other person?
