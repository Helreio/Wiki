## I am grateful for:
1. The dinner at Naro yesterday.
2. Seeing my sister happy and full of life.
3. Being with Lea as I went through all of that.

## Affirmation

"I shall return to my normal routine effectively."

## Review

Did SEP 270.

Went to Lingayen: took photos around the capitol, walked to the beach, had a brief moment, then took shelter from a strong rain.

Dinner at Golden Mami House at Lingayen. Walked after.

Dropped at Bo's Coffee for coffee and pastries.

Watched Solaris with Lea.
