## I am grateful for:
1. Being in a healthy situation. I have no sickness. I am strong. I could lead the participants later on the walk.
2. The challenges presenting themselves on the last minute before this workshop that are making me think about how I might be able to extend my work for others.
3. This opportunity.

## Affirmation

"There is no need to worry. I am walking with friends. I will be in my element later. The right words will come when I need them. I believe. I have faith."

## Review

Lea and I had lunch.

Lea and I attended Benjie's workshop on Hope.

I facilitated my first guided walk. I met new friends: Cha and Bien.

After the walk, we ate at ICs then had coffee and cake at Taza Mia.
