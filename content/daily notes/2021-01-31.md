I am grateful for:

1. Regular sharing and conversations with creatives. I realize how much I missed just because I wasn't living some place like LB. In terms of all my needs, LB is really the best place to stay in the Philippines for now, for me.
2. The feedback I am getting from continuous meetup with people. I need to honor my need for longer alone time. I need to dictate my schedule, so other people won’t dictate it.
3. All the insights I had during yesterday’s bahay-bahayan, as well as the insights I had early this morning.
