I am grateful for:

1. Another 25 days in my hands to use for whatever I like, but most importantly to the things that matter the most.
2. The weather here in LB. It is no longer very hot but it is also not raining constantly. This June air feels like December.
3. For Lea for finding a career and a community where she can blossom. She is no longer lost. She found something she can work on.

"I will make the most of my freedom."

Amazing

- I was able to do some zettelkasten in the morning.
- I did some household chores.
- I walked the entire Jamboree road again and stayed at the grotto for a while.
