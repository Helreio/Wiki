I am grateful for:

1. Finding a new inspiration through Ran Lahav and the philosophical practice movement.
2. Articulating what I want to do. This allows me to find matches from existing people and traditions.
3. Spending some time with Migs and seeing nice places to revisit here in Pangasinan.

"I practice contemplation and philosophy."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about how I will tackle the About Page and my recent encounter with the work of Ran Lahav.

## Projects

### About Page

I re-read and took notes from Dave Ursillo’s story shine process ([https://daveursillo.com/story-shine/](https://daveursillo.com/story-shine/)), which is already 8 years old, my god! I started writing a few drafts of the sections.

### VinceImbat.com

I tried installing forestry to my website but decided not to continue as it was more than what I need right now.

I downloaded Macdown where I will write my blog posts.

## Others

LMS. I wrote a bunch of daily reviews—my backlog for almost a week.

Ju and Diwa asked for a favor to stay for a few days at my apartment. I agreed and thus allowing me to practice unconditional helping.

I walked at Balon Kalsada and rode my bike in irrigation road and back.

Lea shared about her recent argument with her mom. I listened without judgement. I controlled the anger I felt. And I facilitated the conversation with very minimal advice on how to move forward.
