## I am grateful for:
1. The savings and money I have in the bank, which serves as a buffer and protection.
2. Lea for loving me for who I am, for being able to learn what real love is with her, for being able to open myself to her.
3. Getting clearer and clearer with my life work vision.

## Affirmation

"I am able to manage my mind well."

## Review
### Studies

I journaled about why philosophy should still be the central life work, the fuel that drives everything else I am doing.

Created the following notes:
- [[Will you intervene or let people be?]]
- [[Why I walk]]
- [[I wanted to talk about something but I am afraid I am not allowed to talk about it.]]

And modified [[how to write literature notes]].
