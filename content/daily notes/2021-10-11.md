I am grateful for:

1. My sipon leaving me. I hope this continues.
2. Maui, Ju, and Yano for visiting me and bringing me those goods.
3. The lesson that while it is important to talk about our differences to get to the truth, we don't have to hate people or be unkind. We can coexist and be peaceful towards others who are different.

"I am on the right path."
