I am grateful for:

1. Everything I was able to finish yesterday.
2. The cordillera writer's workshop. Something to look forward to.
3. The challenge to be authentic.

"I am undivided."

Amazing

- I continued watching iPS videos.
- I started reading Finding Your Voice after conducting a metalearning process for choosing what to read.
- Replied to Ruth David's email and receive another email.
