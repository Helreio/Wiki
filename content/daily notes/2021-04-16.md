I am grateful for:

1. Realizing how powerful CBT could help me make sense with my most pressing emotional issues.
2. Finally finalizing the setting up of my new hard drive, which feels a lot like my new laptop.
3. Lea for everything she provides me. Without her, I will have instability in life. She’s a very big reason I am able to do the things I want to do and think about self-actualization. She provides me a sense of security.

“I am a practical philosopher. I practice what I learn.”

Amazing

- Journaled about my feelings with Lea and how they might be distorted and corrected using CBT.
- Wrote: [[List of Cognitive Distortions]], [[Triple-column technique]], [[Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts]]
- Wrote a long response to Kerwin and received a similarly generous response from him.
- Continued reading reviews on Jules Evans’ book.
