I am grateful for:

1. Finally being able to facilitate the fixing of the sink in the CR and the door knob in my office.
2. Another opportunity to bond with Diwa and meet with a new artist.
3. The digestive enzyme capsule I took a while ago. It seems like I really am noticing some difference.

To do

- [x] Assist Kuya Randy in repairing the house.
- [x] Send house repair receipts to Lou Ann.
- [ ] Finish setting up Interactive Brokers account.
- [x] Meet Ju and Diwa at Cristian’s exhibit.

“My life is multifaceted. I have a lot going. I don’t get bored. I embrace this colorful existence.”

Amazing

- I had Kuya Randy do some repairs and paid him P800 for labor. I let Lou Ann know but her paying for the repairs was not final. I went through a mildly disturbing morning because of this. Emotionally troubled. Thinking about leaving the house earlier. This further unleashed my emotional issues.
- Met Cristian and his friends (Jed my favorite, Paolo, Alfonso, Jael, and I forgot the others).
- Learned about Nomina Nuda, a thesis on Palawan, Paolo’s story, Jed’s sci-fi perspectives.
- Talked about my own journey in art during the pandemic for the CCP archives.
- Ate at the Vietnamese restaurant.
