## I am grateful for:
1. Another good night sleep. This means a longer and more focused morning.
2. Finding that vignette I shared yesterday in my forest garden.
3. Being alive on this new day that was given to me.

## Affirmation

"I trust myself to take the right action."

## Review

Read [[thoughts/refusing heaven by jack gilbert|Refusing Heaven by Jack Gilbert]].

Searched for a better boundary setting book to read and discovered [[thoughts/the better boundaries workbook|The Better Boundaries Workbook]].

It moved me to be true to myself: left FB chat groups I no longer participate in. It also made me understand that one boundary I want to keep is no messenger interaction with Claire.
