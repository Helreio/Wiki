I am grateful for:

1. My long convos with Lea yesterday. Honest convos clarifying our stands on the vaccine, telling my breakup story etc.
2. My convo with Kuya Frank Mendoza. LJ's father. I learned a lot about a fisherman's life.
3. Being here right now.

"I know where I want to go and what I want to do. I just need to articulate it."

Amazing

- I woke up by 6 am and just sat in front of the beach.
- Kuya Frank approached me and we got to talk about fishing life.
- I ask Kuya Frank what they call mackerel sky. He said "kaliskis na ulap".
- Dipped in the beach for the last time.
- Clarified with Lea about informed consent.
- Chatted with our tricycle driver about lots of things.
- Ate at a lomi house.
