## I am grateful for:
1. Experiencing Diwa's workshop yesterday. Not only will it help me develop my book. It also gave me a taste of what to expect during a writing workshop.
2. Making new friends through all these processes.
3. This new day.

## Affirmation

"I am present."

## Review

Went to Froi's workshop and learned a lot. I reconnected with him and he gave me a copy of Santelmo.

Did SEP 263.

I met my ANWW20 co-fellows via email.

I edited my manuscript for typos and grammar and sent it to the Google Drive.

I prepared the workshop photos I had and sent it to the Ilihan Drive.
