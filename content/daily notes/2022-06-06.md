## I am grateful for:
1. My movie night with Lea. The Godfather was a good movie.
2. Learning how to use IG better to promote my photos and writing.
3. Finishing Lilim yesterday, and now the opportunity to write Uman.

## Affirmation

"I am going to write a minimalist but effective Uman today.."

## Review
### Studies

I journaled about the outline of Uman May 2022.

I wrote the note: [[Cons of FIRE]].

## Writing

I continued writing Uman May 2022.

Read CM's newest Ridgeline: [Walking the Cotswolds, Walking Japan](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/143/)

### Projects

**Pag-ibig MP2**

Watched Nicole Alba's video on the Pag-ibig MP2 and got convinced that it is something I want to invest in for the next 5 years. I learned that a single contribution in the past 6 months is enough to qualify for Pag-ibig MP2. I applied for an account and got accepted.

Re-applied for a Virtual Pag-ibig account.

### Others

- Did a weekly review.
- Watched Godfather II with Lea.
