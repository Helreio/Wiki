## I am grateful for:
1. This morning's walk with Lea.
2. The gift of life.
3. Lewis Hyde, for all the work he did, to birth this book.

## Affirmation

"I will take care of myself."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about [[Ways that artists can sustain their art in a market economy]] and the gift I know I can offer the world.

Continued thinking about the gift. Continued reading The Gift. Wrote [[Some important work have to be done even if they are not profitable]].

### Writing

### Photography

### Walking
- Walk with Lea to Banawe.
- Walk at Lantican and Pancho.

### Projects

### Others
- Started watching Fireball by Werner Herzog.
- Met Care to consult about my headache. Ended up with us consulting with each other. Shared advice about how she can assert herself and make things smoother during the process. Also shared her about the book I am reading, The Gift.
