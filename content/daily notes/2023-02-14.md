## I am grateful for:
1. Finishing the OVIC overview updates.
2. Buying myself some time, which I could use for other projects and most especially thinking and applying.
3. The quiet walk I had yesterday at Do√±a Aurora.

## Affirmation

"Freedom is just around the corner."

## Review

In my journal, I expressed my feelings about Lea's finances and my gratitude for having the opportunity to explore difficult emotions through my relationship with Lea. I also wrote notes to use to talk about Lea's finances.

I finished processing all the remaining journal entries in [[2018-10 to 2019-10 Diary]]. I also fixed its index and that of the [[2018-07 to 2019 Diary]].

I replied to Jamie Vidich and Glory Ann Ocay.

Lea and I watched Teenage Bounty Hunters while having lunch.

After lunch, Lea and I had a difficult but necessary conversation regarding our finances.

After talking, we went to Rocks and Tea for our Valentine's date. We ate pasta, burger, and chicken with milk tea while playing sequence.

We then walked to the UP Feb Fair to see the food and listen to the line ups. We looked for a place to lie down on the grass. We looked at the stars and talked. I helped Lea rethink about her freelancing .

We walked at Grove to look for a place to eat at. We decided to eat at Ruby. After dinner we went home.

I read and took notes on [[The Rise of the Full-Stack Freelancer by Tiago Forte]].

I payed Underlords before going to sleep.
