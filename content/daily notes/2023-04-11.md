## I am grateful for:

2. Meeting Maui and Yano to talk about my proposal.
3. My work that is calling me.

Lea and I watched two episodes of Beef while having lunch.

Around 2:00 pm, I walked to Sining Makiling to meet Maui and Yano and talk about my proposal. They took the Standard Package but asked me to help with the Ili workshop pubmats. We also talked about the possibility of being a social media manager for them.

After the meeting, we had merienda at Malaya Cafe.

I bought a few food too cook, walked some more in UP, then met Lea at Enzo's Ramen to have dinner.

At home, I played Underlords then washed the dishes before sleepling.
