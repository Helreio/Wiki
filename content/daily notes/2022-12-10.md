## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing that Mama is happy. It is as if she was given a second life sometimes.
2. The walk I did from here at Cablong to the land at Banaoang. That house filled with art was something.
3. Hearing regards from Tita Luz.

## Affirmation

"Life is beautiful."

## Review

In my journal, I wrote that life is beautiful even when it is tiring. I also wrote about how nature is capable of compassion and how I miss philosophizing freely without thinking about my source of income. I then wrote a poem draft: [[poems/pitamitam]]. I also tried translating Rofel Brion's poem Minsan into Pangasinan.

In the afternoon, before leaving for a walk, I translated Thich Nhat Hanh's The Five Remembrances into Pangasinan: [[say limaran pakanodnonotan]].

I started applying at Paper True. I passed the grammar test and I have started the editing test.

While having lunch, I watched Derry Girls.

I ordered the Pangasinan books in Amazon and requested Tita Villa to buy me Humument.

In the afternoon, I rode my bike then walked the Botao-Carusocan Road, which I extended toward the road to Tebag. I walked the way back. Then I rode my bike from Balon Dalan until the Irrigation Road where I continued walking.

When I arrived home, I had dinner while watching the season finale of the last season of Derry Girls.

I continued edting for the PaperTrue test before retiring.
