Continued reading Teju Cole's Open City.

Finished reading the sample of Martin Bunzl's Thinking While Walking. Bunzl tackled one problem every station of the trail. I am thinking about doing something similar, like walking as personal development and each town shall tackle one aspect of personal development.

Listened to a podcast episode where Marie Forleo interviewed Elizabeth Gilbert.
- Liz prepared for her speech at Oprah's event while walking. She memorized it for four months spending four hours a day just memorizing it.
- There are days in our lives when we will have to show vulnerability and share our fears, that was not the day for Liz. She had to show Oprah's audience and model what courage looks like. She reasoned that those in that audience have enough fear. They don't need hers.

Dealt with the iCloud issue by trying out Obsidian Sync.
