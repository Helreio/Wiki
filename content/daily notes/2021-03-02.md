I am grateful for:

1. Everything I have accomplished yesterday. For the first time since I arrived in Los Baños, I can say that I have truly invested into my personal space. I am slowly easing in into my new environment, and I am looking forward to finally fully moving in.
2. Ate Mona, for finally finding a source of income, ending her search in a relatively short period of time. I feel good helping a fellow human being with no strings attached. I just want her to succeed.
3. My friends, for inviting us for a walk on Wednesday.

To do

- [x] Start Monthly Review.
- [ ] Write application for learning another way.
