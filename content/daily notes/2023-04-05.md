## Review

Studied other designers processes.
- [[Website design and development onboarding questionnaire]]
- [[Web design process by Rafal Tomal]]
- [[Web design process by Dylan Albertazzi]]
- [[Web design process by Megan Weeks]]

I reviewed the Essential Web Design Handbook by Rafal Tomal.

Lea and I had lunch near Raymundo then we had Fried Oreo at Dainty Gourmet. We talked about how I could aproach sending proposals to Candent and Ili.

After sending Lea off to Calamba, I went to Sining Makiling and the Bookstore but both were closed.

I went to Savemore to buy skin care needs then went home.

At home, I had merienda, continued studying, then played Underlords.

I then walked back to UP and read an issue of TTT while sitting on the grass at Freedom Park.

I went home, had dinner while watching Cobra Kai, played more Underlords, and washed the dishes.

Before sleeping, I sketched packages I could include in my proposals for both Candent and Ili.
