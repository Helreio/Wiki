I am grateful for:

1. Lea's company and her positive reaction to my message.
2. Feeling confident that I will pass this QA and I will do it today.
3. This Scribendi challenge. It prompted me to treat my source of income better, and with it, to think about my financial life even more.

"I am an excellent editor."
