I am grateful for:

1. Sharing moments with Ruth no matter how brief they were.
2. This moment. This moment.
3. The reminders from the movies we watched the past two nights: About Time and The Intern.

"I will take hold of each moment I can from this day and really savor it."

Amazing

- I started writing Lilim with both personal story and AK like writing.
- I went to Satya and spent time with old and new friends.
- Bought Likhaya goods and talked with Ome.
- First time to boil pasta by myself!
- Watched Lupin.
