## I am grateful for:
1. Lea's safe arrival back at Calamba.
2. Today. My goal of seeing my family together again after 2 years shall finally happen.
3. My brief stay in Baguio. Wonderful.

## Affirmation
I have a wonderful family.

## Review
### Studies

Did my first spaced repetition processing. I fleshed out the structure note on [[thoughts/purpose]].

I re-listened to Craig Mod's Office Hours podcast episode on how to be a better writer then took literature notes.

### Projects



### Others

- Woke up early to go home to Pangasinan.
- Witnessed my family see each other again complete after 2 years.
- Rode my bike with Paeng.
- Went by myself to my new favorite trail to walk, reflect, and think.
