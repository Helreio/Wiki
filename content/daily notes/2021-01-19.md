I am grateful for:

1. Samo Burja's interesting and thought-provoking series on intellectual legitimacy. It somehow puts into context what I am attempting to do. But at the same time, it seems to remind me also what I am "not" trying to do.
2. This moment. This present moment. This perfect moment.
3. Finally watching films with Lea. It is something we missed doing for 300 days. Yes, it is less ideal in terms of my work routine. But I missed this and I am so grateful that we’re finally doing it again this January 2021!

To do:

- [x] Continue Annual Review.
- [x] Translate Thoreau.

“I will make the most of my time today to set my intentions for the rest of the year and to reconnect with my authentic self.”
