I am grateful for:

1. Getting connected to my real calling, vocation, practice, purpose.
2. This moment. It is perfect as is.
3. The breath. For giving me an anchor to what is.

- Achieved more than 10,000 steps by walking towards IRRI then back to Robinson’s where I looked for an induction stove caserole.
- Continued watching the Tony Parker documentary.
- Talked to Lea and told her how I feel when she suddenly shifts the focus of the conversation from me to her. She tried asking questions, which felt weird. But I stayed with her until the atmosphere got better.
