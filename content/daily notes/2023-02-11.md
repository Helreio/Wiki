## Review

In my journal, I wrote about my reflections on Steve Patterson's article about Christianity, particularly about [[Love]].

I read [Lawrence Weschlerâ€™s Taxonomy of Convergences](https://austinkleon.com/2022/05/02/lawrence-weschlers-taxonomy-of-convergences/) by Austin Kleon.

I worked on three OVIC overviews and finished them.

While having lunch, I watched Cobra Kai.

I played a game of Underlords after lunch and before I went back to work. I palyed another one before walking.

I walked at Viado and Madamba. I saw that Freedom Park has been closed for preparations for the UP Fair. But a fair, ferris wheel, anchor's away, etc. was already running.

I reached out to Velle Almazar.

After finishing the OVIC overviews, I played another game of Underlords.
