# 2020-12-27 5MJ

- 5MJ
   - I am grateful for:
      - Having Migs around for a few weeks. It has been a while since I've bonded with him. This is also my first time to be with other people in person in a long while. I know it is weird right now but it's actually beneficial for my well-being.
      - My conversation with Lea last night. It is one of those conversations that leave me feeling grateful and happy.
      - The excitement that 2021 is already building up within me.
