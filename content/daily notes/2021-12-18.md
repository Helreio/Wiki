I am grateful for:

1. Going on with the walk to Alligator Lake and being rewarded.
2. My ability and desire to appreciate and celebrate nature - even if I am still not good about it and it is hard.
3. Just being alive to see all of these happen.

"I celebrate nature."

Amazing

- I spent the entire morning piecing together my walk to Tadlac lake.
- I had an existential crisis about my financial habits.
- I researched how to answer the question: to save money for something or to get a loan.
- Walked to UP while thinking about my financial habits.
- I watched 100 rabbits talk and inspired to question about what I stand for.
