I am grateful for:

1. Rem, for taking the time to engage with my questions and articulate his thoughts.
2. Finally finishing my working quota for this month.
3. Being able to control my emotions, to work with them, in such a way that they serve me and provide me with the feedback I need to get better.

To do

- [x] Weekly review
   - [x] Review goals and projects then prioritize
- [ ] Transate Thoreau

“I live my truth. There are so many things I don’t know. But there are things I already know.”

Amazing

- I finished working with Scribendi.
- Finished Weekly Review.
- Tried having laundry.
- I watched I Care a Lot with Lea.
- I walked towards Mayondon.
- I told Tita Mona that I was feeding the cats. She said I was good for doing so.
- Tita Mona was kind enough to tell me that I should tell her if she’s too noisy for me.
- I worked on improving the security of my online data and laptop.
