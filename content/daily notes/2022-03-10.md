I am grateful for:

1. A deepening understanding of what purpose and meaning is.
2. The fact that I am able to create my own moral system, worldview, and way of life.
3. Being alive at this very moment.

"I am the captain of my soul."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about my commitment to create my own worldview, to apply that, iterate, document, and share it. I then identified subprojects or subgoals I could have under this commitment.

I wrote a draft note about the difference between purpose and meaning.

I reviewed and updated My life work note. I articulated that uncovering my purpose is a long-term project. So for now, I will use a smaller projectâ€™s purpose as my priority.
