## Review

- Ate eggs and rice for our last breakfast at Quezon.
- Said my goodbyes to our hosts.
- Rode the skeets to Itay's house and said our goodbyes. He said that they were waiting for us. They have prepared lodgings and even cooked for us. Itay said he wanted to interview me.
- Rode the skeets again to town. We had to get off of the road many times because there were many people going to the beach.
- Rode tricycle to the van terminal and said our goodbyes to Tita Remy.
- Rode van to Lucena.
- Got off at DLTB and rode it. It was my first time to ride an aircon provincial bus since the pandemic.
- Got off Turbina and went to Villa to get Lea's stuff.
- Went to SM where we had lunch and experienced for the first time SM's discriminatory vaccine rules.
- Got home to LB.
