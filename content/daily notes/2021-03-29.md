I am grateful for:

1. The reminder that it is the small things that really matter in life. It is what happens in the day, in the moment. We live life moment by moment and there is a large difference between living it for the future and living it for the Now.
2. Papa for being okay. I know he is growing old and I can't control what he does. He is his own man. I know I can't continue to be near him. But I hope he is okay. I am happy that he is okay.
3. Being healthy and okay relatively while the place I am living in is full of anxiety. My practice is living and I may not be in the "best" position yet. But I am doing fine.
