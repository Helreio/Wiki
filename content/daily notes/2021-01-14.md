I am grateful for:

1. Being able to successfully deliver last night's facilitation through the Circle Way. It was wonderful to hear compliments from both Rem and Claire, telling me that I can already facilitate. Interestingly, it feels “maginhawa” for me to facilitate, contrasting it with the possible work I’ll be doing as a lecturer.
2. The advice that I received last night from Rem, Benjie, and Claire about how to respond to Vec’s invitation. The invitation brought unnecessary stress, something that I was not anticipating and has definitely bothered my peace.
3. The challenge to make everything work here in LB and to use it as a jump off point to everything I want to do and everything I want to become.

To do:

- [x] Continue my Personal Annual Review.

“I control my emotions and actions. I have freedom of time. I have autonomy. Things I enjoy and need to protect.”

Amazing
