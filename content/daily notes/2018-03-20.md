## I am grateful for:
1. My safe travel home yesterday. I am alive. I am whole. I am here.  
2. The wonderful experience with Ginhawa and my other friends.
3. That restful siesta. Unforgettable.

## What will I do to make today great?

1. Because, I am letting go of the problem of relocation at least for now, I will go back to my studies. Should I continue studying formal logic? Or should I instead, focus on doing projects that make me learn along the way? Assess this.
2. Start reading June Prill-Brett. 
3. Start creating Tukod.

## Affirmation

I am continuing my mission today. For now, I let go of my worries.
