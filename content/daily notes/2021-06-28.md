I am grateful for:

1. Being able to conquer yesterday's walk. It was a bit dangerous. I am grateful Lea and I was able to come out in one piece.
2. Ruth David's email. Responses like that are what inspires me a lot and keeps me going. I know that someone, at least one person resonates with me. And that is enough.
3. Seeing that kako and the dogs are all okay.

"I am able to touch people with my writing. I have done my work."

Amazing

- Continued watching iPS modules 1 and 2.
- Went to Aina at its new location after a long time of not going.
- Started watching Lupin.
