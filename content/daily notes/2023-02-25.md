"I will be a better person."

## Review

Continued writing the inclusion paper.

I played Underlords and tried using the two-star wraith lord and summoners build.

Walked at UP with Lea then went to Jollibee to use the voucher gifted to her. We had a great conversation while having dinner.

Back at home, I finished writing the overview of the paper. I then began writing the section on inclusion in the workplace. I saw how my previous process helps me write the paper.

I played a couple of Underlords games then prepared for sleep.
