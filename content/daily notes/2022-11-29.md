## I am grateful for:
1. Claire for holding on and never giving up.
2. Getting approved at Course Hero.
3. The patience on even little things such as this laundry that isn't finished yet.

## Affirmation

"Intend to give quality of action to everything you do."

## Review

In my journal I reflected about what I can learn from the impatience I am feeling waiting for my laundry. I realized that we live in a world where quality of action is low. Then I connected this with people's desire for community like churches where quality of action (and life in general) is aspired. I then concluded that I see freedom as more important than ease of life.

I wrote the note:
- [[the feeling that any task is a nuisance - thich nhat hanh]]

I joined the public group of the Unitarian Universalists of Metro Manila.

Lea and I watched Wednesday while having lunch.

I tried Course Hero. It wasn't for me.

I walked at Pili Drive.

I had dinner while asking Lea whether she would advice a beginner freelancer to jump into freelancing immediately.

I bought a few household needs then cleaned downstairs.
