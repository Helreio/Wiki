I am grateful for:

1. Being able to raise my overall happiness just by transferring at LB. How I perceive my relationships have gone high. It's amazing.
2. This crow that just showed up. Give me something new to see today!
3. The memories of going to Palaui.

To do

- [x] Journal
- [x] Prepare to go to Calamba

“I am letting the day lead me.”

Amazing

- Insights came to me about approaching writing with the right intention: to express, communicate, and connect.
- Discovered the book “Be the Gateway” by Dan Blank.
- Went to Calamba and bonded with Lea and her siblings. I also got to eat good food for lunch.
- Walked to LB town to look for binangkal. Bakeshop was close already, but managed to buy a different bread and get some exercise.
- Fruit salad session also yielded new thoughts and realizations.
