I am grateful for:

1. Being able to touchbase and articulate what I really like in life. It's not perfect at all, but I am not starting from scratch. I know the mental states that I desire. I can start there.
2. Seeing that the dogs back at home are doing well. All of them respond at each other’s names. I haven’t seen Chami for a very long time. It’s good to see that she’s okay. I miss Chikako. And Doji too.
3. The ECQ being okay so far.

“I will be more efficient in tracking my actions.”
