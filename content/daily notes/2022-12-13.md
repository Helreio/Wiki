## I am grateful for:
1. Having Papa send me off and spending some more time with him.
2. The time I spent with my family and all the good things we did together.
3. Finally being able to really focus on my job search.

## Affirmation

"Everything will be okay, eventually."

## Review

I was woken up early by those pesky roosters.

After Papa accompanied Mama to Sta. Barbara town via motorcycle, he accompanied me to Matic-Matic to wait for my bus. We waited around 30 minutes. I met Lolo Ben, Tatay's "ina-anak," and the character behind Papa's story about what happened when Nanay was burried alongside Tatay. Papa said that Lolo Ben said, "Ama, ni wadia lay Ina. Ibaan to kayo la."

I rode a relatively fast-moving Five Star Bus to Cubao.

While in transit, I did a few reading. I read the following from my Instapaper:

- [Mechanics Before Ethics by Steve Patterson](https://stevepatterson.substack.com/p/mechanics-before-ethics)

Around 1 pm, I rode the HM bus to Sta. Cruz. While in the bus, I discovered and listened to the music of Fil-Am artist Tim Atlas. His music is really good.

When I arrived at LB, I rested a bit then Lea and I walked to Selina's to eat there for the first time. The food was good. We had yang chow rice, chopseuy, and pata kare-kare (unfortunately, they had no alamang).

Then we walked to UP, where we sat on one of the benches in front Searca. When we went home, we downloaded Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which we watched patiently until the end because we were already both sleepy.
