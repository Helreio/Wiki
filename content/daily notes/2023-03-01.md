## I am grateful for:
1. The things I experienced in February, both the ups and downs.
2. My last day of working full-time on this research paper. Tomorrow, I would start my editing and proofreading improvement project.
3. The serenity of the present moment.

## Affirmation

"I am love."

## Review

I watched the entire playlist of Scribbr on Research Design.

I then started writing Chapter 2 of the paper in more detail.

Watched Teenage Bounty Hunters at lunch
