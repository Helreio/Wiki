I am grateful for:

1. A wonderful day with Lea yesterday.
2. Papa saying Lea is welcome here again.
3. Seeing the children here play.

"I am alive and grateful for it."

Amazing

- Had my last breakfast with Lea during our Pangasinan trip.
- Rode with Tito Joel and Tita Jessica to town to send Lea off.
- Continued pruning my Talahardin.
- Downloaded pdfs from Masterclass.
- Rode my bike to Butao and back.
