I am grateful for:

1. That awesome walk I had yesterday.
2. Getting clearer about what I want others to feel and experience through my work.
3. The meditative state I am in.

Amazing

- I was able to review contents of my diary and used it to inspire further thoughts.
- Tried Ace Ark. Got Champy vaccinated with anti-rabies and had her fingernails cut.
- While waiting for my turn at the vet, I was able to nail down what I want my newsletter to look and feel like based on Craig Mod’s newsletter.
- Replied to Kerwin.
- I walked around Bangkal and discovered streets I haven't seen before.
- I discovered what connects Robinson’s to Taal, etc.
