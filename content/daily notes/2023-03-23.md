## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing Benjie last night and talking to him.
2. These two opportunities to work with amazing friends and people's businesses and improve their existing online platforms.
3. Walking

## Affirmation

"I will start returning to my memories and writings to piece together a concrete answer to the question: why I walk?"

## Review

Browsed more Kritika Kultura journal articles to look for inspiration in writing the essay.

Reviewed some Lilim issues.

Discovered the book Embodied and Walking Pedagogies, which has an article specific to walking and liminality.

I worked on SEP 258.

I walked.
