## I am grateful for:
1. Spending an afternoon with Maui, Yano, and Lea and just genuinely giving space for the story of Ili (where it came from and where it wants to go) to emerge.
2. The sleep I had last night. Much needed and hopefully provides the energy I need to do my work for the rest of the day.
3. This opportunity to grow as a writer.

## Affirmation

"I am a writer."
