I am grateful for:

1. My weekend with Lea's family.
2. At least 8 days free before I go back to work.
3. The challenge of pursuing growth while taking care of my needs for security.

"I am choosing growth every day."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about my dark side. I wrote about my initial thoughts about it. I listed a few situations that generate negative emotions in me. I also wrote about a psychological scar (caused by my avoidant upbringing) and ways of coping with my dark side. Finally, I wrote about how I can transform my dark side into a transformative force.

Interestingly, as I processed two diary entries, I encountered a note I wrote from a screenshot about a stoic response to indifferent parents. I also wrote about the problems of Ran Lahavâ€™s deep philosophy and my own ideas on how I should approach philosophizing.

## Projects

### Credit cards

I did the liberty of going to the BPI branch at Lopez Ave. and request that my credit card renewal be sent there where it will be available for pick up.

## Others

- I continued watching Narcos.
- I walked to forestry and back.
- Me and Lea started to talk about our trip to Baguio.
