I am grateful for:

1. The honest conversation I had with Lea last night. I think it so important for me to really have a feel about how Lea's family treats me. When I become true to who I really am, things don't necessarily become easy. But I feel good about myself. So I will be myself and not conform to their values.
2. This day. The last free day in the next five days. My intention is to make my work day tomorrow "fun" - at least try to.
3. The kind words readers have about my work. It means a lot to me to be seen.

"I am who I am."
