## I am grateful for:
1. Champy for accompanying me right now.
2. My evening walk to Forestry last night, which proved to be grounding and illuminating to my writing project.
3. This thesis I am currently reading about walking as a way of knowing.

## Affirmation

"I will make good use of the two hours I have this morning before cooking."

## Review

I started working on the [[Entry to ANWW20]].

I continued reading [[Walking as a Way of Knowing - Amoroso]].

Wrote [[Walking is a privilege]]

Watched Making a Murderer at lunch.

Withdrew emergency fund money from COL financial.

I walked.

I had a call with Benjie talking about the Candent website and other stuff.
