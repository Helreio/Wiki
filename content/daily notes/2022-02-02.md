I am grateful for:

1. The opportunity to practice understanding and compassion with Lea last night.
2. My courageous walk under the dark night yesterday. Seeing the lights of LB in the horizon behind the backdrop of the evening sky was amazing.
3. Being alive at this moment.

"I am compassionate."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about my difficult conversation with Lea.

I continued reading Thich Nhat Hanh’s extended biography, particularly on his monastic training.

Processed my journal entry on Thich Nhat Hanh’s equation (Understanding → Compassion → Happiness) and my insight that outer work enhances one’s inner work.

## Projects

## Others

I wrote the monthly report for January public version and sent it as Uman’s first issue.

I started reading Craig Mod’s report on his third year of memberships.
