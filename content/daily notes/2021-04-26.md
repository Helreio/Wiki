I am grateful for:

1. Witnessing last night how I used the voice of reason to respond to Lea's drama. I used stoicism and it happened almost automatically.
2. The 25 days I will be free again to do what I want to do, starting today.
3. Losing 1 pound today.

"I am able to effectively use reason to experience better emotional health."

Amazing

- I read Craig Mod's article about his "boring" walk in Japan. I checked him out after and was immediately inspired.
- I ate lunch with Lea and her siblings.
- I ate my first halo-halo for this summer season with Lea.
- I tasted the maki at SM Calamba.
- Wrote a reply to Kerwin.
- Watched Alias Grace.
