I am grateful for:

1. Being able to hold space for criticism. It was never natural for me to do this. But I am finally learning. And it's amazing.
2. The many social gatherings here in LB. I remember the times when I felt so alone in Pangasinan. I no longer feel that way. In fact I need to protect my introvert space because there can be too much!
3. Care's inspiring example.

"I protect my boundaries."

Amazing
