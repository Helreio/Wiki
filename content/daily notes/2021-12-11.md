I am grateful for:

1. A good sleep.
2. Encountering Theodore Eldin
3. That study session at Diwa's house

"I am calm. This is a stoic lesson. The opportunity to apply what I learned."

Amazing

- I was able to keep my calm even when a neighbor's radio is loud.
- I walked around Mt. Data and Sierra Madre to look for the source of noise. I saw it but did nothing.
- I tried contacting the barangay through their hotline and facebook, but did not receive an answer.
- Wrote about my walk.
- Went to Satya with watermelon and a few kiat-kiats. Good idea!
- Had a really good time with hugpungan. Felt like my old people person self.
- Met Maurice Duka and JC.
- Went to Belen with EG and took pictures then bonded more at Diwa's.
