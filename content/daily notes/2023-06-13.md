## Review

Checked out of IRH and walked to Gate 2.5 until the point at Katipunan where I could ride a jeep to Cubao.

Met Lea at Why Not Coffee and ate waffles with chicken.

Walked to Solid North and rode the bus to Pangasinan.

Continued to read [[On Writing Well by Zinsser]].

Ate pigar-pigar for dinner before resting at Migs.

Conversed with Lea before sleeping.
