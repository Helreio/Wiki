I am grateful for:

1. My two-week vacation in Pangasinan.
2. My safe arrival in Los Ba√±os despite the glitch at Tarlac.
3. Jerome responding fast and professionally.

"I am calm."

Amazing

- I tried journaling just outside the door downstairs. Interestingly, I kinda recreated what I felt in Cablong. Outoor journaling is the best.
- I did my morning routine sans working on my Talahardin.
- I continued shopping for a monitor and finally decided to go with the Philips usb-c monitor.
- Bathe Champy.
- Had lunch with Lea and bonded with her.
- Slept quite a bit.
- Walked with Lea to Grove and ate Mini Moo ice cream.
- Walked at Pili Drive then back.
- Went to Ate Grace for yogurt but none.
- Went to market to buy food.
- Walked again to grove to buy umbrella. Forced myself to walk that far.
- Continued watching Bodyguard.
