I am grateful for:

1. The fact that things are not yet that divisive here in the Philippines in terms of the vaccine.
2. Being able to shut down the news to focus on my thoughts.
3. Another opportunity to work on my ideas.

"I am capable of reaching out to the right people and making genuine connections with them."
