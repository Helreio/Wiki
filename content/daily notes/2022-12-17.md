## I am grateful for:
1. Finishing my interview with Lea yesterday and now having specific steps to take in my study of copywriting.
2. My consciousness practices that help me ground myself as I work through difficult emotions and situations.
3. My feeding sessions with Champy. I find them therapeutic.

## Affirmation

"I am on my way to making money out of something that feels better."

## Review

I journaled about the negative emotions I am contending with after being laid off and how I am addressing each. I listed my strengths to revisit them.

I tried exploring Upwork. I took the Upwork 101 pathway and learned how to write a profile. I discovered other Upwork translator freelancers.

However, I watched some [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=why+you+should+never+use+upwork) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yX_N5242Hg) that made me realize it is not something I want to invest time into.

I walked at Juliano and Viado.

In the evening, Lea and I watched Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince while having dinner of tacos.
