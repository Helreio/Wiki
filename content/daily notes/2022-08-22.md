## I am grateful for:
1. Being able to hold that convo with Lea last night.
2. This morning's reading of Bugbee.
3. Philosophy.

## Affirmation

"I am strong. I can help Lea be strong throughout this process."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.
- I started journaling my commentaries on each of Bugbee's journal entry. His epistemology inspired me to create a new tag in my forest garden: seeds. I then transferred all field notes to individual seed notes and published them on the site.
