## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing how Claire and Diwa have started to mend the wounds last night.
2. Learning more about Diwa and her stances and the intricacies of building a friendship with her.
3. Realizing more and more what I can do and what I cannot do.

## Affirmation

"Everything will be in their rightful place."

## Review

I journaled about my priorities after Rem's departure, my personal grieving process, and the projects related to Rem's vision and legacy that I am called to participate in.

Lea and I went to Savemore to buy a gas stove and some food and household needs. We also arranged for an LPG seller to install our LPG tank.

We watched Derry Girls while having lunch.

In the afternoon, I did a weekly review then started my monthly financial review.

In the evening I walked at Viado and sat down a bit on a bench at Freedom Park.

While having dinner, Lea and I watched Rhythm and Flow.

I helped Lea budget her money.
