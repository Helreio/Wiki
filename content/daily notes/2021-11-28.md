I am grateful for:

1. The invitation to go to Calamba today because there's food!
2. This clean space.
3. The little moments of joy and meaning despite the world I am living in.

"I have a scout mindset."

Amazing

- Started researching about how to handle the flea problem.
- Went to Lea and tasted Tita Mila's handa.
- Watched Izla.
- Had meryenda with Tita Remy's Biko.
- Walked to plaza with Lea's fam and ate in the food park with lots of people. Ate chicken mandi.
- Went home while reading Sharyl Attkinson's summary on Covid 19 vaccine. Probably the most comprehensive collection of links around.
