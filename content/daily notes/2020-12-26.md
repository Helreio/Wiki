* I am grateful for:
	* Losing the weight I gained from yesterday's eating through a more vigorous bike ride this morning. I felt terrible that I gained a kilo fast after just one day. Going for that bike ride was enlightening about the body's ability to lose weight fast. Nevertheless, I need to get back to better eating habits.
	* This silent and peaceful morning after Christmas. My neighbors haven't been playing the radio loud since the last time I went there to tell them.
	* All the books that accompanied me through this pandemic. A lot were poetry books but I got a lot from the nonfiction books too. I want to honor them as this year ends.
* To do
	* {{[[TODO]]}} Morning routine
	* {{[[TODO]]}} Continue journaling on my hero books
	* {{[[TODO]]}} Continue Annual Review post
	* {{[[TODO]]}} Write a year review routine
	* {{[[TODO]]}} Check the hole in my eardrum
* "I am going to start living this 2021!"
* Amazing
	* LOTR 1 B2 C4b
	* Journaled Hero Boos of 2020: Switching Languages, The Journal of Henry David Thoreau, other reads
	* First time to ride a bus during the pandemic. People were not really observing social distancing. Passengers need to log their details for contact tracing. I learned that we can actually wait for the Mangatarem bus from here if we want to visit Mangatarem next year.
	* Continued Annual Review post
	* Continued reading How to take smart notes
	* Conversation with Lea for almost 2 hours while I was in Binmaley
