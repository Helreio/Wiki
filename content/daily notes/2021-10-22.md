Amazing

- Traveled with Lea's family on a van in the midnight. Stopped in a 7-11 where I got to treat her sibs with something and her mom with load. Her mom introduced me properly to her cousins.
- We arrived in Lopez town very early.
- First time to ride the skeets. Had lots of fun.
- Met Lea’s grandpa and saw that he was converted in being a JW.
- Met Lea’s tito, tita, cousins, and pamangkins.
- Had a good, tasty lunch.
- Went to the beach.
- Saw a child beaten by a jellyfish.
- Had a chat with Kris Ann, while waiting for Lea to take a bath.
