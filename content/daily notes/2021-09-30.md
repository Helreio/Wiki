I am grateful for:

1. Finishing my sustenance work earlier than usual. I have one extra free day.
2. The challenge to make the most out of the coming days.
3. Knowing that my family back in Pangasinan is okay.

"I can process this well."

Amazing

- I just let the day be spontaneous.
- Lea and I connected really well once again.
- Lea and I went back to EasyWings.
- Lea and I went to Ate Grace to look for a teapot. Lea fell in love at first sight with one.
- We did the second photoshoot. The lighting was better.
- We walked to Grove, continued talking, and bought mangogoyo.
- I walked at UP, finally walking past the vet department and connecting the dots.
- Listened to Jack's interview and learned a lot about what is probably going on in me right now.
- Shared to Lea the article on regrets, she read it and hopefully understood me better.
