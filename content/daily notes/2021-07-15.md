I am grateful for:

1. Being reminded of the real work I want to do: answering the question "How should I live?"
2. Discovering the silent spot at Laguna de bay.
3. Fruit Salad

"I am a sincere seeker of truth and Ginhawa."

Amazing

- Processed the entire Life System folder in Evernote.
- Bought a new fan for the other room.
- Continued watching Kingdom.
- Started watching Burning.
