I am grateful for:

1. This window. This view. I found a glimpse of what I am looking for here.
2. Yesterday’s flawless conversation with Lou Ann even after our shaky start. I was able to control my emotions and not utter anything that would derail the process.
3. Being able to tell Tita Ed that I am leaving.

To do
