I am grateful for:

1. Meeting Rom. I feel like I met a great resource for inspiration and experience. He is full of experience and yet also very accessible. And his aura and personality is something I resonate with.
2. Rem and Claire. Just nurturing my friendship with them has connected me to so much creative inspiration. It's just amazing.
3. The sacred time and privilege I have to create today.

Amazing

- The iphone 11 pro arrived. I thought it has an antenna problem but is now resolved.
- I received favorable responses on my essay on HEAL.
- I continued watching David Sedaris' Masterclass.
- I didn't eat bread for breakfast and didn't eat any dessert after dinner. My weight dropped for about 3 pounds.
- I reviewed my diary and processed it for inspiration on my next easay.
