## I am grateful for:
1. Champy's cuteness.
2. Poppy for slowly integrating and feeling at home.
3. The challenge of career design.

## Affirmation

"I will find my path."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I wrote a note about [[Career capital theory]] by [[Cal Newport]]. I also journaled about my initial reservations to the theory. After reading a few critiques online, one by [Daniel Feiman](https://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-why-skills-trump-passion-quest-work-you-love) and another by [Curtis McHale](https://curtismchale.ca/2020/05/08/things-cal-newport-missed-in-so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/), I wrote them in a new note about the book [[So Good They Can't Ignore You — Newport]].

I then started reading [[Range — Epstein]] (read two chapters).

But I switched to reading [[the gift - hyde]] for now, as it is more pertinent to my current research interest and life needs. Before this, I listened to a 30-minute interview with Hyde at the podcast Makers and Mystics.
