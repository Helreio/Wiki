## I am grateful for:
1. The Macbook Air for arriving in one piece.
2. Kissa by Kissa and CM for creating it.
3. Homespun and spending 2 hours of almost uninterrupted time there.

## Affirmation

"I will find what I am called to do when walking."

## Review
### Studies

### Writing

I journaled about my experience reading Kissa by Kissa, and what I learned from it that I can use on my life work.

I continued reading Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.

I wrote a few new notes on my Talahardin, which relates to my writing life:
- [[thoughts/lilim]]
- [[Ben Hewitt]]

I typed a new walk narrative on Ulysses about my UP walk after eating Bingsu at Seoul Kitchen.
