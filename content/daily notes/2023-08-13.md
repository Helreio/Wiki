## I am grateful for:
1. That must needed conversation last night with Lea. I know I needed to say those words and they just came at the right moment and time.
2. Billy Collins. For a wonderful Masterclass. For pouring out everything. I have somewhere I could start. My appreciation for poetry has just enhanced.
3. Lea

## Affirmation
