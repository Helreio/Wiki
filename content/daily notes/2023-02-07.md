## I am grateful for:
1. The wonderful massage last night. I got to relax and at the same time experience something indigenous!
2. Camille. A lovely, kind, caring, and generous cousin! Not toxic at all.
3. Being able to bring Via to school. I am really glad I went to Baguio!

## Affirmation

"Today is for family and friends. I will be present and provide what I could give to them."

## Review

I bought my VLI tickets for the trip tomorrow.

I continued pruning my Clay connections list.

I started perfoming a Weekly Review.

I had merienda then I prepared to leave for the meet up with friends.

I went to SM and looked for Volante. There, I found Kleinifer and Gerald. Gerald talked about his journey to finding law. I shared what happened to me after graduation (freelancing and dating!). Then Klein shared how she recently found love in Japan.

By 7:30, we all left together. Klein bought me carrot loaf from the Country Club stall at SM.

After we separated ways, I walked at Session Road to buy peanut roll. I then went to the Public Market to find cheap choco flakes. After buying, I looked for anyone selling binatog. There were several binatog vendors at the Night Market but they were not allowed to sell to me until 9:00 pm. I just walked back home.

At home, I ate some bulalo and rice while bonding with Via. I then called Lea.

Before sleeping, I finished watching a Cobra Kai episode.
