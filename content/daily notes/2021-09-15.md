I am grateful for:

1. Being able to construct the LMS presentation for later.
2. Hearing that my mug gift for Lea is ready for pickup.
3. Lea finding a place for us to visit to celebrate our anniversary.

"I am a researcher."

Amazing

- I finished the life management system workshop.
- I started looking for ways to implement a spaced repetition writing system.
- I found Cesar Rodriguez's work.
- Walked to UP and did some errands.
