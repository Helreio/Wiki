I am grateful for:

1. Finally going back to my regular routine so I can do the work.
2. Seeing my friends and having lots of fun with them.
3. Lea's company while I transition from the noise of Pangasinan to the solitude of LB.

"I am living in a better place while still tightly connected with my family."

Amazing

- I journaled a second outline of the workshop where I used praxeology concepts.
- Continued developing the workshop.
- Started watching Cruella.
- Walked to buy yogurt, yigos, groceries, and pick up laundry.
- Started making plans with Lea about our Batangas trip.
