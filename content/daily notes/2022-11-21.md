## I am grateful for:
1. Meeting new friends.
2. Seeing the beauty of nature (again) that up close.
3. Reading about free religion and realizing all the possibilities of what could happen in the near future in terms of my career.

## Affirmation

"I am on my way to living my best life."

## Review

I journaled that returning to LB feels like going to the real retreat. I also wrote about the possibility of returning to editing but before that at least finish reading Design Your Life. I wrote about the beauty of Tanay and how it solidified my desire to do pastoral work.

I wrote the notes:
- [[explore metaphysical and epistemological beliefs as if it was a walk]]
- [[life design assessment]]

I stalked Tet Gallardo on the internet.

Lea and I watched Ancient Apocalypse at Netflix.

I shared the tungko username and password at Tuloy-Daloy. I also commented in Uwa's post.

I wrote, edited, and published [[tlw/006]]. I also edited its accompanying photos.

I edited my poem [[poems/naiiyak rin ang sansinukob]].

I walked at Lantican—Pancho—Viado—Roxas—Freedom Park—Royal Palm.

I bought a few groceries.

I ate dinner while watching Derry Girls.

I shared our photos at Tanay via stories.
