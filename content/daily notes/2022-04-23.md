## Field Notes

## Review
### Studies

I continued reading The Write Life by Annie Dillard.

### Projects

**Obsidian Migration**
- Migrated all project notes successfully.
- Reviewed how a writing inbox should be implemented and I was actually doing it all correctly except for literature notes there that should be in Zotero.
- Read about how and where people kept their writing projects while using zettelkasten. One thing I learned was that putting writing projects outside the zettelkasten prevents search from getting muddled.

### Others
- Woke up early to walk with Lea at ICM then inside Teacher's camp.
- Had a buffet breakfast.
- Met Jeff and Sars and ate at Casa Blanca with a new friend Jane.
- Ate at Quesadilla Queen and shared laughter, a good scenery, and good stories.
- Introduced Lea to Ate Mau and her family
- Walked with Lea to SM.
