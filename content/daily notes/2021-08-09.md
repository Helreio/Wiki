Amazing

- I journaled about how I should react to Lea's mother.
- I translated [[Kaliskis na Ulap â€” Mga Salin#07-22-1860 Malabahag-hari]].
- I continued reading and processing the emotions entry.
- I went to Ate Grace's shop and looked at the items. I bought a P65 container for spices.
- I continued watching Money Heist.
- I listened to Austin Kleon's interview at Call Paul.
