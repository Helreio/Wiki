I am grateful for:

1. Yesterday. It was a really, really fun day.
2. Craig Mod. I read his newsletter and I am feeling some Numina once again. I feel like I want to develop my aesthetics more and be more intentional in curating my spaces to facilitate the emotions I want to feel.
3. Esso coffee shop for an experience like no other and also reminding me of aesthetics. I want to do philo but in a beautiful way.

"I am able to curate my space to have fun with my creativity every day."
