## I am grateful for:
1. My afternoon with Ju and Diwa.
2. Articulating my needs to Lea successfully.
3. This beautiful cool Sunday morning.

## Affirmation

"I am a person who is loved and is capable of showing love."

## Review
### Studies

I journaled about semi-retirement and why it could make sense to me.

## Writing

I finished writing Lilim and published it on the newsletter, blog, IG, and FB.
I edited the photos for Lilim and used white borders for the first time. Photos look neat and even the mediocre ones improved their visual quality.

### Projects

### Others

- I watched Sex Education 03(07).
- Lea and I had dinner at 2nd floor diner.
- Lea and I watched The Godfather 1.
