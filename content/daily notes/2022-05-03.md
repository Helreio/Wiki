## I am grateful for:
1. Arriving in Los Ba√±os, here at home, safe and sound.
2. An opportunity to look back at April and evaluate my year up to this point.
3. Seeing my entire family together and being with them enough.

## Affirmation

"The next three months will be awesome."

## Review

### Studies

### Projects

#### Obsidian migration

I tried impelementing a method to see the files I created and modified yesterday, but that doesn't work in Obsidian. The available plugins do not do what I need.

### Others

- Fulfilled monthly report
- Continued watching Ozark.
- Met Ju and Diwa at Haraya. Their food is okay, but pricey. The ambiance is superb.
- Sat at a bench at Velasco with Ju and Diwa and talked about a lot of stuff including turning the available space at Casa Francisco into a community space. Diwa shared the model of Conspiracy Bar.
