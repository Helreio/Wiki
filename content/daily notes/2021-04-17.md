I am grateful for:

1. Being able to share my story to a complete stranger and receiving a similar display of vulnerability. I mean, how often do you experience that via the internet!
2. Unlocking an entire world that I didn’t know existed because I wasn’t looking enough. I am currently filled with hope that I can finally do my work and show up as who I want to be.
3. Meagan for remembering me.

“I am a good friend. I show up and take the initiative.”
