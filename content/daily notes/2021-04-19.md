I am grateful for:

1. This journaling session where I was able to touchbase with my current thoughts and issues. My life is really my practice and this journaling habit is helping me really pay attention to what is happening in my life.
2. My environment, my personality, and these systems that help me be more conscious about where my health is going. Some people will find it more difficult to maintain a healthy life because they don’t have some of the things that I have. For this, I am thankful.
3. Migs and Megs. For being okay and for having the opportunity to see them again later.

“I am capable of holding space for other people to express themselves.”
