## I am grateful for:
1. Lea for telling me that critical piece of information: onbording questionnaire should come after they have paid the first deposit.
2. My reading time last night while sitting on grass. It felt good and grounding.
3. This beautiful, silent morning.

## Affirmation

"I am a pleasure to work with."

## Review

I watched two YouTube videos about making a proposal specifically for a web design project:
- Darrel Wilson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44BZSDIYY8o
- Elementor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwS4MoZdiQU

I wrote notes for each:
- [[Web design proposal by Darrel Wilson]]
- [[Web design proposal by Elementor]]

I watched Cobra Kai at lunch.

I also started to study the tribe proposal: [[Proposal template from Freelance Movement Tribe]] and started writing my proposal for Ili.

I then spent my afternoon walking to Maahas Road for the first time. It was one of my best walks in LB.

I then had dinner watching Cobra Kai.
