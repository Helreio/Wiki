## I am grateful for:
1. Feeling better today. Less fever. The pain on my lower spine seems to be gone. I hope this is going to continue.
2. For July. An interesting month full of philosophical readings.
3. The strength that I had yesterday that allowed me to finish my requirements even if I was feeling sick.
