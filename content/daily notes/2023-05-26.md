## I am grateful for:
1. The opportunity to write this morning.
2. Being alive.
3. Knowing a few UP students who call me Kuya when they see me.

## Affirmation

"I will make good progress writing the essay today."

## Review

Decided not to go to UPD to see the last screening of Diwa's film.

Continued writing the essay for Palanca.

Lea and I watched two Korean series episodes during lunch and merienda.

Underlords.

I went to Juwa's place to feed the cats then walked a bit.

Had dinner with Lea at Rocks and Salt.

Went to UP and talked with Lea while sitting.

Embedded the MailerLite signup form back to my website then set up and automated Welcome email.

Underlords.
