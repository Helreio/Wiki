## I am grateful for:
1. Being time affluent. Having enough time every month to pursue my interests and studies
2. The poetry that I saw yesterday outdoors: a cat napping on a chair in front of an abandoned house.
3. The day - a format of work that makes a lot of sense.

## Affirmation

"I will just let it all flow."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about this: [[Poetry and narrative trace their history so readers can re-enact them]].

I also journalled about [[thoughts/henry bugbee]], [[The philosophical method of Henry Bugbee]], and how they relate to [[We learn to live while we are living]].

I also rearticulated my purpose: [[thoughts/my purpose is to live deliberately]]

I continued processing notes from [[The First 20 Hours â€” Kaufman]] and others:
- [[Three-stage model of skill acquisition]]
- [[Credentialing can hurt rapid skill acquisition]]
- [[Practice is necessary in acquiring skill and knowledge]]
- [[Acquire just enough learning to deliberately practice and self-correct]]
- [[Sometimes you only identify learning objectives after starting to learn]]

I invented my own term of art for rapid learning: [[Just enough learning]].

### Writing

I received confirmation from Cheyenne of my confirmation for scholarship to Alex Chee's course.

### Photography

I finalized [[My photography learning roadmap]] and marked the photography metalearning project as complete.

### Walking

I wrote: [[Connection with space, object, or scene is the most important part of my walk]]

### Projects

### Others

- Watched Molly's Game.
