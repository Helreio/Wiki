## I am grateful for:
1. Finally piecing together my quartz site. I might be able to launch today once I fix the blog posts and write the home page and about page. Which will take time.
2. Papa finally getting a car.
3. Being alive and feeling okay.

## Affirmation

"I will find a way to make this life more awesome."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

### Writing

- Received good news from TLDTD that two poems of mine are getting bulished: Gawat and its translation Tagsalat. I made 20 USD.

### Photography

### Walking

- I walked the fishponds at Naguilayan.

### Projects

[[Project log - Forest garden publishing]]

- I learned how to fork a repository correctly: fork all its branches, clone it to your local machine, and push to hugo when ready. This makes sure that updates are not synced automatically.
- Modified past blog posts to match Quartz.
- Tried modifying the font in Quartz template.
