I am grateful for:

1. Finally setting up a spaced repetition writing system that has less friction and is embedded in Craft itself.
2. Reaching two amazing years with Lea.
3. Maui's work with the mug.

"I am in a happy and nurturing relationship."

Amazing

- Journaled about how I can setup the spaced repetition writing system more simply using Things.
- I synced Google Calendar with Mac's native calendar app, which syncs with Things. I created repeating events in Google Calendar to remind me to review tags in my Writing Inbox. This shows up in my Things.
- I started processing my Writing Inbox.
- Started watching Wolf of Wall Street.
- Walked at Forestry.
- Had an anniversary call with Lea.
