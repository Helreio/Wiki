I am grateful for:

1. Coming here in Rem's house safely and without much hindrance.
2. Seeing Rem again after quite some time, feeling that my insights are making some difference in him.
3. That yummy roasted chicken last night!

"I am a really good listener to my friends."

### Thoreau's Website

Finished going through the Congo theme’s docs and tinkering the theme.

- Tried different homepage styles.
- Learned about taxonomies
- Tried creating a favicon but failed.
- Learned that my next action for this project is to go through Hugo’s documentation and customize the site based on what is there.

Found a public domain photo to use as graphic element for the Craft translation page for Thoreau’s journals.

Transferred all Thoreau translations under the Craft page for Kaliskis na Ulap and modified the page.

## Others

Went to Lipa, Batangas to eat Lomi.

Went to Redemptorists Church.

Saw Metropolitan Cathedral of Saint Sebastian.
