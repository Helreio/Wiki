I am grateful for:

1. Mama feeling ok, still having her eyesight.
2. My cousins and titas and aunts. Amazing in these circumstances.
3. The growth I had yesterday. I learned a lot about navigating these situations. I feel like I know how to do this better next time.

I still feel unwell. But less severe as when I was the one feeling the pain and suffering. This is probably the first time, I really encountered suffering via someone else, a person I love. It is a different kind of suffering. Less severe. But it lingers at the back of my mind and is the first thought I have when I wake up in the morning or in the middle of the night.
