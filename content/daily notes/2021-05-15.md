I am grateful for:

1. Letting myself get lost in learning something.
2. Champy getting her first 4-in-1 shot and Shorty getting deworming.
3. Rem’s response. Our conversations are getting more real. I feel more authentic when I am talking with them.

“My mind is calm like water.”

Amazing

- I learned that IBKR might not be the best for me esp because I have no plans of being a trader yet.
- I started opening an Ameritrade account.
- Finally understood how to make orders in COL financial.
- Understood why Ginvest might not be a good investment for me.
- Went out to go to the market and grocery.
- Understood what REITS are and how to invest in them.
