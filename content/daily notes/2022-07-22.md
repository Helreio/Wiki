## I am grateful for:
1. Lea, for being one of the kindest and loving and forgiving person that I know. Her love flows naturally, doesn't stop flowing. She isn't even conscious sometimes when she does it.
2. Going through yesterday without much drama.
3. Coming to terms with Thoreau's philosophical stance, specifically his metaphysics and epistemology.

## Affirmation

"I am a philosopher."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I wrote about my feelings towards learning about [[The philosophical stance of Thoreau]].

I read [[Lyrical Philosophy, or How to Sing with Mind — Epstein]] and took literature notes.

I also read Ed Mooney's own definition of lyrical philosophy: https://edmooneyblog.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/lyrical-philosophy/

I asked myself: [[How can I combine truth and beauty in one philosophical practice?]]

Aside from this, I wrote the following notes:
- [[Is it possible for a human being to be absolutely objective?]]
- [[Does meditation make us more objective?]]

Along the way, I also discovered Lin Yutang's book *The Importance of Living: A Lyrical Philosophy*.

### Writing

### Photography

### Walking

5:30-8:00 pm
Ela–Rambutan–Pili Drive

I had a really recentering and almost poetic evening walk, which produced fruitful field notes.

### Projects

### Others
