## I am grateful for:
1. My date with Lea last night at Jollibee.
2. Being able to finally write the research paper and seeing the beauty of my process in action.
3. This beautiful cold day.

## Affirmation

"I will finish the RRL and start writing the theoretical framework."

## Review

I continued writing the literature review.

Lea and I watched Insurgent.
