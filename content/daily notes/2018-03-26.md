## I am grateful for:
1. That tiny dog I saw at the jeep last Sunday. Made me reflect about the helplessness of many animals against human aggression. Pets are very much in a better position than meat animals. It's a problematic ethical problem. And the tiny dog reminded me of compassion.
2. That sense of kindness, mercy, and compassion that is in me and each of us actually. It might not be very logical and utilitarian sometimes. But its existence is a critique to our more rational selves.
3. Love

## What will I do to make today great?

1. Immerse in Dave's course.
2. Continue reading TISH.
3. Fix the bike

## Affirmation

I am in the path towards knowing what is true and what is right.

## 3 amazing things that happened today

1. Finished two parts of Dave's course. Some parts are difficult to read. But some definitely make sense.
2. I didn't expect Dondon to come. But come he did and we had a really good time.
3. Mini's email was really good.
