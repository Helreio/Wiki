I am grateful for:

1. Resolving the ride issue. I am set to go home to Pangasinan this weekend.
2. Claire for thinking about me for the rambutan.
3. Weston A. Price's work.

"I have the tools and knowledge to create an environment that helps me eat well."

Amazing

- I journaled about using the last four months of the year to address my nutrition.
- Processed some notes about expressing truth and navigating differences in belief.
- Finished watching Mandy.
- Walked to buy yogurt, get my rambutan and laundry.
- Finished conducting a monthly financial review.
- Had a Fruit Salad where we had some discussion regarding food.
