Amazing

- I journaled about what I will do when I get to Sta. Maria.
- I wrote a lot of permanent notes for HTTSN.
- I found a cheap ride to Pangasinan.
- Continued watching Mandy.
- Did two walks around UP: one after lunch and one in the evening.
- Received message from Claire that she got rambutans for me! Yipee!
