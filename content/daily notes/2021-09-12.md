I am grateful for:

1. The wonderful and emotional week. From leaving LB to traveling back to Pangasinan after 8 months and seeing all my loved ones again through navigating covid beliefs, seeing the abandoned house and bonding with my father and finally seeing Lea, the cats, the house, and LB once more. Wow. It was an intense experience.
2. Being able to share that brief moment with Tito Joel. He is not my favorite person in the world. But it feels kinda fulfilling to finally walk on a gray area I just used to tiptoe on.
3. Really, really feeling Kako once again and spending quality days with her.

"I am in control of my thoughts and emotions."

Amazing

- I journaled about what I am feeling after reaching LB and my insights from Pangasinan.
- Lea and I did some chores and went to Sunday Market.
- Lea and I watched Master of None episode about religion while having lunch.
- Wrote and published [[Lilim, 02(08) â€” Just to Avoid Death]].
- Spent time with friends and had lots of fun playing Uno.
- Went home while chatting with Claire.
