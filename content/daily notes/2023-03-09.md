## I am grateful for:
1. Being able to walk and go out this morning with my feet okay to see the world and move and move my soul along.
2. Knowing a vet who is kind, caring, and down to earth, who I can rely on for the needs of the little creatures in my life.
3. Cari. She's growing up so fast!

## Affirmation

"While this day will be busy, I will find quality time for rest and connection with myself and Lea."

## Review

I continued working on the Inclusion paper.

Watched NHIE at lunch.

I withdrew available cash from eToro to my BPI.
