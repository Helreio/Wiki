## I am grateful for:
1. Discovering Sean Tucker, another person I could research.
2. Learning how to use focus in LR mobile.
3. The courage and drive that I have to create.

## Affirmation

"I can become authentically me."

## Review
### Studies

### Writing

I started the draft for Lilim 03(05) and wrote an extra two pages of my journal about why walking and what I want to achieve from it.

### Photography

I journaled about Sean Tucker and his alleged philosophical approach to photography.

I then read the first chapter of his book *The Meaning in the Making* while listening to him narrating. I also watched his video on his social media philosophy.

I finished Mike James' free course. Then I watched his manual focus on LR mobile video.

I spent the entire afternoon (almost) just editing the Makiling shots. I noticed that I am slowly learning when to best use the tools available. I still do lack skill with colors, but I am generally happy with my basic editing skills.

### Projects

### Others

- Lea and I had dinner with Juwa and Yvette at Juwa's new house.
