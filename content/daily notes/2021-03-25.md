I am grateful for:

1. Being able to admit to myself that I made a mistake last night when I uttered those words to Lea. Even if I had a point, saying it the way I said it won’t make any difference.
2. The flapping of these leaves in front of me, which made me stop.
3. Learning more about the science of personality through Scott Barry Kaufman’s work.
