## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing that Claire is ok and strong enough to take everything one day at a time.
2. Being able to set goals for this month.
3. My walk with Lea last night including catching up with Ate Nancy.

## Affirmation

"I am here to support Claire."

## Review

I journaled about the podcast episode I listened to between the Riverside Interfaith Council and the Inland Empire Atheists and Agnostics and how it reaffirmed my desire to live in a pluralistic world. I also wrote a reflection on on Rem's overview of the Pathfinder's Commune.

I wrote: [[Amoralism does not prevent me from feeling strongly against certain behaviors]].

I installed Parallels Desktop on my Mac.

Lea and I continued watching Rhythm + Flow.

I prepared my answers to the questions for the first Tuloy Daloy group. In the evening, I went to the first meeting of the Tuloy Daloy group. We shared our current grief processes and explored different trajectories moving forward.
