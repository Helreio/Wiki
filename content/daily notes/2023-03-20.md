## Review

I continued working on the OVIC overviews for the entire morning.

While having lunch, Lea and I watched Never Have I Ever.

I continued writing the overivews after lunch and while having merienda.

In the evening I walked at Madamba.

I had dinner while watching more Never Have I Ever.

While washing the dishes, I listened to a few YouTube videos on autoethnography:

Then I reconciled our budgets.
