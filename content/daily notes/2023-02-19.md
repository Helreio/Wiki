## Review

I woke up to prepare for my call with Krys Tolentino.

I prepared an outline based on Lea's advice.

I called Lea to ask for more advice particularly on talking about rates.

Lastly I watched an online job intereview video and prepared for potential questions they will ask.

We had the call from 11 am to 12 nn. It was a successful call overall.

I ate lunch while watching Cobra Kai.

I started reading the journal article for the writing test.

I walked at UP: Velasco–Narra–Lantican–Pancho–Royal Palm.

I waited for Lea to arrive. I sat with the cats at CDC to wait for the rain to stop.

Lea and I had dinner at a Diner at Halcon that served steak. I rewarded myself by eating a ribeye steak.

We went home and played sequence for the first time. Lea won both games.
