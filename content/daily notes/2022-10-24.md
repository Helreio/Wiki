## I am grateful for:
1. Rem. The only true brother I have ever had.
2. Friends, who are all with us together at this difficult time.
3. Being alive. Being around family.

## Affirmation

"I will take care of Rem's memory."

## Review

I learned the results of Rem's autopsy. It was acute pancreatitis or bangungot. After reading this, I myself had a nightmare and experienced sleep paralysis as if I was Rem minutes before he left.

I browsed my entire photo library, collected every photo with Rem then chose the best ones that are not redundant and uploaded them in the Drive. Claire asked for a high resolution photo of Rem and I edited the two photos that were used for Rem's poster and for the portrait over his coffin.

I did a walk at the irrigation road and allowed thoughts to flow about my relationship with Rem.
