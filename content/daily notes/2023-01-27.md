## I am grateful for:
1. Arriving at Cubao safely.
2. Remembering: there is no failure, only feedback.
3. The opportunity to see JV and support his family later.

## Affirmation

"There is no failure; only feedback."

## Review

Traveled to Cubao.

Traveled from Cubao to Dagupan. Saw Julius at the bus.

Ate at Inasal.

Went to Bari and spent time with the gang.

Met Trisha.
