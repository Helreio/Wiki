I am grateful for:

1. Finally understanding how to track my investments vis a vis my income and expenses. That realization to me was priceless.
2. Transforming my relationship with money slowly. It’s been a wild ride but I am progressing and that’s what’s important.
3. Peace of mind.

“I will control my attention, my peace of mind.”
