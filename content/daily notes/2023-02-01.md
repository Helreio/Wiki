## I am grateful for:
1. Spending the afternoon with my family and cousins at Karen's place.
2. Having coffee with my cousins while looking at the sunset behind the mountains at Bo's Coffee.
3. Playing Underlords again! With Migs.

## Affirmation

"I will find a source of income to support me."

## Review

I finished the essay for Academia Research and sent it. I received the results a few hours later and I didn't pass.

I joined my extended family for lunch.

After lunch, we rested a bit then went to Footprints with Karen to get a massage. It was an okay massage, definitely better than the last one I got years ago.

We then went to CSI Lucao where we ate shawarma and talked for a bit.

Back at Binmaley, I had karaoke night with Migs and Cams. We talked about getting married and adulting.

I realized that in a few months, my relationships with my cousins will definitely change as they are transitioning into marriage life. I also realized that if Lea and I really want children, we may need to seriously consider having one within five years.

Champy had her prophylaxis successfully and Lea reported me everything.
