I am grateful for:

1. Lea. For giving me a colorful 2 years. The second year, we spent in close proximity together.
2. My gift to Lea ready to pick up at Maui's.
3. Finding Cesar Rodriguez's implementation of a spaced repetition writing system, which I can adopt in Craft.

"I am an efficient thinker."

Amazing

- I walked to Maui's place, picked up the mug and chatted with her and Ana.
- Finally set up the spaced repetition writing system and tried it out, generating data about how I can further customize it to suit my needs.
- Tasted Lea's tasty pork binagoongan.
- Watched Master of None.
- Started looking at my resources and checking out what I could process there.
