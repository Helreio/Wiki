I am grateful for:

1. Embracing my introversion. I did not choose to join the call this morning with Another Way, because I want to first watch the calls and see what happens there before I join. This is what feels good for me.
2. Yesterday’s fruit salad. Listening to Rem’s sharing was inspiring. Listening to Lea’s sharing was a positive sign. Listening to myself express myself was therapeutic.
3. Finally finishing my first consultation with the UP vet teaching hospital.

To do

- [x] Continue How to Take Smart Notes
- [ ] Accomplish NAs at Things

“I’m an introvert, and I’m great the way I am. My life is my message to the world and I’m going to make it inspiring in my own way.”

Amazing

- Wrote [[poems/ito ang pinakapangit na tula sa balat ng lupa]]
- Finally able to get into flow with my note-writing practice
- Started to have real progress in my conversation with Lea on her money situation
- Treated Lea and Claire for ice cream.
- Walked at UP.
