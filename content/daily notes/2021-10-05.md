I am grateful for:

1. The opportunity once again to work.
2. Being calm and relax this morning.
3. Being okay even if I am alone.

"I am happy."

Amazing

- I finished editing an interesting sci fic: Possum Man.
- Walked to UP to buy yogurt etc.
- Continued watching Mr. Robot.
- Got asked by Diwa about our vaccination stance and I said it firmly.
