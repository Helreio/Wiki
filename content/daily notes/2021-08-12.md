I am grateful for:

1. Last night's Fruit Salad.
2. Having Benjie in my life. He is like a father I never had.
3. Champy's lambing.

"I know how to communicate my truth through actions."

Amazing

- Journaled about the insignts I had from the last Fruit Salad and my thoughts on Buddhist philosophy on the Self.
- Helped Rem prepare a bouquet for Claire and delivered it.
- Went to Mommy's Corner at Calma Compound and bought 6 plates and the table. I got to know Monica more. She gave me a free glass!
- Had Avocado at Mango-go-yow and had a conversation with Lea at the ES Gazeebo.
- Tasted durian ice cream, langka ice cream, buchi, takoyaki, and lipote wine c/o Ome.
- Helped Claire with her pizza blowout and took photos.
- Walked with Diwa to buy at Ate Nancy and withdraw.
- Started watching Malice at the Palace.
