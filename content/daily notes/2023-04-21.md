## Review

I walked with Lea to Grove.

I joined my friends for breakfast under the tree near Sining Makiling.

I went to SM Calamba and spent some time at Booksale. I bought Song Lines by Bruce Chautwin.

I went back to Los Ba√±os and had lunch at Chowking.

I went home and slept for about two hours.

I played Underlords.

I went to Siento to eat dinner and do some thinking.

I watched this video about the differences of vision, mission, and purpose: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55Q5B8do06c
