I am grateful for:

1. Having a new fan on the other room. Lea and I won't have to share fan and we can work separately when she's here for maximum focus.
2. Finally processing my life system notes and realizing how much of a jump I made from being utterly clueless about managing my life to creating a system in place.
3. My life system. Now that I am reviewing it, I just feel so grateful for what I was able to build and the mental space that it created for me.

"I have a mind like water."

Amazing

- Translated Thoreau after a long, long time.
- Wrote zettels elaborating my life system ideas.
- Walked to UP to buy yogurt.
- Continued watching Kingdom.
