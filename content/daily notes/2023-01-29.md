## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing how Tito Lito was loved by the people around him and how Tita Lilibeth was supported by her family.
2. Hearing my Papa say I love you to me.
3. Bonding with Cams and Bobet.

## Affirmation

"Love is what will get us through everything."

## Review

I joined Cams, Bobet, and Kuya Nonong's family. We drove to Robinson's Calasiao to join to to buy stuff.

After this, we went to Bali-Bali for dinner. We listened to a band with a gay lead vocalist singing 80s songs. Moymoy sang Jopay the new version on live band.

We walked a bit at the baywalk while looking at the stars and admiring the moon.

We then rode a tricycle to Binmaley town to visit the perya. My cousins played a bit and won Php 120. We bought pancakes and sweetcorn.
