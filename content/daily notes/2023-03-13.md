## I am grateful for:
1. Bevs' example of how trying things out will lead you to an idea that eventually works out for you.
2. My friends - no matter how imperfect and complex they can be, I learn a lot from them, I gain courage, and feel that I belong to a portion of this big wide earth.
3. The residency program that I could apply for.

## Affirmation

"I'm an artist."

## Review

In my journal, I wrote how my one-page writing practice is helping me remember that my craft is important to me amid this project of fixing my livelihood system. I also wrote about the similarities between walking, writing, and living. [[Writing is walking is living]].

I continued my metalearning project for improving my editing and proofreading skills.
- I finished browsing the KOK Edit knowledge database for education and training. I discovered CIEP and other organizations offering training.

While having lunch, Lea and I watched Never Have I Ever.

After lunch, I continued cleaning the house by vaccuuming the rooms and the stairs.

I continued the metalearning project a bit while having merienda. I checked the list of trainings offered by editors themselves.

Then I went to a walk to Forestry. Lea accompanied me until Grove then I went by myself. It was a very grounding walk.

When I came back home, I ate dinner while watching Cobra Kai.

After dinner, I addressed a revision that Krys needs for defining disability.

I then spent about an hour reconciling our funds.
