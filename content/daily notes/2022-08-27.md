## Review
### Philosophy etc.
- I finished reading the Wikipedia entry on religious naturalism.

### Writing
- I wrote a lengthy Facebook post about why freelancing and entrepreneurship is more financially secure than a 9-5 job.

### Photography

### Others
- Travelled to Cainta Rizal with Lea and attended the first live event she hosted. I met Sariah and her group.
