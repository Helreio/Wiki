## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing Claire for the first time in about half a year.
2. Receiving gifts from Claire: the beautiful journal, the chocolate, the mug top.
3. Yesterday's food, from the shawarma to the pasta salad.

## Affirmation

"I am a philosopher."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I read the Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy entry on Thoreau (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thoreau/). It showed me how different I am to him philosophically, which was mind-blowing and depressing at the same time.

Wrote the following notes:
- [[A philosopher is necessarily a gadfly]]
- [[Photographic vision must arise from life vision]]
- [[Is visual voice simply choice of subject and environment?]]

I also read https://bigthink.com/thinking/objective-reality-2/ because I was asking myself whether it is really possible to be objective.

- Ate Godfather's pizza while watching Ted Lasso with Lea.
