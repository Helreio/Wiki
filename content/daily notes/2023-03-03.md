## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing Benjie, Joji, Bevs, and Embi yesterday and spending some time sitting on the grass.
2. Seeing Kris Ann after quite a long time and being okay being with her.
3. Finishing the first draft of Krys' paper and getting paid for all that hard work.

## Affirmation

"In everything I do, love shall lead me."

## Review

I listened and wrote show notes for SEP 255.

Lea and I watched the season finale of Teenage Bounty Hunters.

I did a monthly financial review by reconciling funds, adjusting budgets, and sending money to the couple fund.

While having merienda, I read and took notes on this article about Krista Tipett: [Healing a Nation After a Season of Vitriol - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/us/politics/healing-a-nation-after-a-season-of-vitriol.html).

I played Underlords.

I walked at Viado and Madamba then bought dinner.

Lea and I watched Allegiant while having dinner.

After the movie, I checked Lea's budget.

I played Underlords then prepared for bed.
