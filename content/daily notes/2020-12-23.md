   - I am grateful for:
      - Seeing Doji and Chikako again after learning that they were looking for me when I was gone.
      - Having parents who talk to each other in a better way.
      - Learning that I don't have to worry about the credit card issue and having a friend like Raschel who can assist me about it.
