## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing Kessy, Tom, and Halvie yesterday after more than 2 years. It was a bit wrong not to meet them earlier. But I am glad we saw each other again.
2. A new day, an opportunity to think about purpose and how that could infuse the work I do.
3. All the constraints, material and cultural, of living in the Philippines and dreaming and working from here.

## Affirmation

"I could make it work wherever I am in the world."

## Review

### Philosophy etc.

### Writing

I journaled about how I should put writing in perspective and not allow it to cloud the more important work: living.

I wrote a few notes:
- [[Thoreau prioritized content over style in his writing]]
- [[The writing I do in private is my most important writing]]

I read Thoreau and the Literary Excursion and the first chapter of Thoreau: The Quest and the Classics.

### Photography

### Walking

### Projects

### Others

- I committed to PDF Expert as my reader since it has a sync capability and it allows exporting highlights.
- Continued watching Trying.
