## I am grateful for:
1. Our amazing game night last night.
2. Flowing with others. Being in the moment. Realizing how much I need others. How I want to be with them.
3. A new day added to my life.

## Affirmation

"I am a person who needs and longs for connection."

## Review

### Studies

I journaled about a board game idea that should teach compassion and contemplation to players.

I started exploring Thayâ€™s life by reading a portion of the Wikipedia entry on him and his short biography in the Plum Village website.

### Projects

### Others

Played Werewolves with Pajal and Arnel.
