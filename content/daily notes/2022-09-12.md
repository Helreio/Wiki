## I am grateful for:
1. Finally understanding how to use YNAB and seeing how powerful it indeed is.
2. Seeing that Carly is relatively okay and seems strong and healthy.
3. A new day to continue life and explore what is yet to be discovered.

## Affirmation

"Everything will be okay."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I read some parts of Overlap by Sean Mccabe. I then journaled and took notes while reading. I wrote about what I am truly passionate about and my intention to provide value to the world and build a career I don't have to retire from.
