I am grateful for:

1. The last breakfast I shared with my family for now.
2. This vacation in Pangasinan. A rest and retreat. A reconnection and reminder. I'm now ready to go back and build the life of my dreams.
3. This chair where I spent most of my stay here.

"I have a wonderful family back here in Pangasinan - living in this new wonderful house they are recreating their lives in."

Amazing

- I had a wonderful breakfast with my family.
- I journaled at the field by myself.
- Said my goodbyes and had Tito Jo bring me to Tuliao. It was a nice ride. Looking at the fields was calming.
- Rode Kelly's car and saw Basista for the first time in years.
- Kelly's car got broken in the middle of sctex. We exited in Paniqui, Tarlac and waited for our rescue to arrive.
- After more than an hour of waiting, our rescue arrived and we were back in the road.
- I arrived at Los Ba√±os finally with chicken adobo waiting for me. Lea and I shared it.
- Continued researching for a good monitor for my macbook.
