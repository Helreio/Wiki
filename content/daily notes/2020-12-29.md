- 5MJ
   - I am grateful for:
      - My walks near the pond. It reconnected me with Nature. I want to go back to my pond when I get back home.
      - Migs. For reaching this age, a doctor, in relatively good health, happier than he was before, and integrated well back into my life. He is friendly, he knows how to take care of a friend, he is easy to be with.
      - My stay here. It was a good break. I wanted to go back to more stability as the end of the year (and the decade!) is drawing near. But this break is really something I need too.
   - To do
      - {{DONE}} Morning routine
   - "I will start the new year and decade well."
   - Amazing
      - LOTR 1 B2 C6
      - Journaled about my transfer to LB project.
      - I had a fun time with Migs, Bobet, Nelson, and Raymond yesterday until early morning a while ago. It has been a long time since we last did this with everyone.
      - I decided not to go home yet so I can spend time with my friends.
      - Learned a lot about what I can do to move my project of transferring to LB.
      - Met some of Mig's titas (Au and Lea)
