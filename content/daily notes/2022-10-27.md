## I am grateful for:
1. Meeting Kuya Iktoy yesterday. It reminded me of what I used to do and what I can do now for these people.
2. The calling for community. Rem is challenging me to get out of my comfort zone and embrace his gift.
3. All the love I've received yesterday.

## Affirmation

"I will never stop loving Rem."

## Review

I started reading [Why would an agnostic do interfaith work?](https://appliedsentience.com/2015/07/09/2937/)

I continued communicating with Ka-Iktoy. I researched some vegetables he can use against gout then sent them to him.

Diwa asked me to translate Interbeing Wedding. I sent Dampiang Diwa. She made an unconscious edit "Daop Diwa" which is probably better.
