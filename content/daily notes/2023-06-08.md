## I am grateful for:
1. This day before the workshop: an opportunity to finalize everything and truly feel confident.
2. Everything that led me to this and everyone I met that helped me to get to this.
3. My teachers: Rem and Sir Rofel for reminding me to always be myself, stay on my well, work from my source.

## Affirmation

"I go to the workshop to be free through writing and be of service to fellow writers."
