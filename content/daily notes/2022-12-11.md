## I am grateful for:
1. This insignificance. A reminder to always be humble.
2. Yesterday's editing learnings and flow.
3. Love.

## Affirmation

"Love is the best way to get through all of these."

## Review

In my journal, I wrote what would be the rought draft of [[essays/the night sky]].

I created the following notes:
- [[poems/pitamitam]]
- [[say limaran pakanodnonotan]]
- [[poems/sa dilim]]

I continued doing the editing exam at Paper True.

I read [Why I adore the night](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1560053265).

After lunch, I then started writing TLW 9.

I walked at Balong Dalan—Botao-Carusocan Road—Maticmatic-Maronong Road—Garcia Street in the evening. It started to drizzle along the way.

After dinner, I finished writing TLW 9 and published it.

I ask Czyka about the concerns of Sir Melchor regarding publishing at Kwago. Czyka generously answered our questions.

I walked again towards Maticmatic-Maronong Road around 9 pm while it was still raining.

While waiting for Lea to arrived, I finished editing the Paper True assignment and sent it.

I continued watching The Tree of Life.
