I am grateful for:

1. The adventure with Diwa and Claire yesterday.
2. Seeing Sara give birth and remembering my mother.
3. Being alive to experience the elevated day yesterday.

"If the elevation of the day is the highest form of art. Then being with friends is one of the most potent way to create that art."

Amazing

- Cooked pinakbet tagalog in a better way.
- I discovered a vlogger who did the hard part: review different proposals from insurance companies in the Philippines.
