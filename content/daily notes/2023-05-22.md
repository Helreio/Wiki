## I am grateful for:
1. The people who made Valerian. Contrary to Rotten Tomatoes reviews, the movie was fun and the acting of the characters I think was okay. It was a feast for the eyes.
2. Feeling less sleepy this morning. Hopefully, I could translate this into deep work.
3. Being alive for another day.

## Affirmation

"I am honest."
