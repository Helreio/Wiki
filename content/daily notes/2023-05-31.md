Continued working on Candent's Marketing Strategy. I prepared for the meeting.

Watched Grace and Frankie at lunch.

I started reading Elio Garcia's manuscript for ANWW20.

I did some basic market research for Candent.

Underlords.

Walked to Forestry. I sat down at a bench for a longer time and realized I need more time like this with nature, just being with nature.

Had Chadiz pizza for dinner to end May with a bang.

Had another meeting with Benjie to continue Candent's marketing strategy.

Underlords.
