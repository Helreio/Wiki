I am grateful for:

1. Being a lone wolf, not subscribing and sticking to one perspective, being open to everything else, relying on my own mental functions.
2. Getting feedback that I am not enjoying my work as I used to in the past. Either I look for another job or find ways to enjoy the work.
3. Befriending my new neighbor.

To do

- [ ] Continue working.

“I am the captain of my soul.”
