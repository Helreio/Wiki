## Review

Woke up by 6 am, prepared, and went straight to JV's house for the funeral. While waiting I chatted with Julius about how he coped with his father's death and his current relationship.

Then we walked to Bari until the Forest Lake memorial park where a short ceremony was held. Jay Vee gave a speech, then Tita Lilibeth. Listening to their speech was heartbreaking. Then we walked toward where the pit is and watched as Tito Lito was drawn down. White flowers were thrown into it. Then everyone started leaving, going back to the hall to eat.

After eating we joined cars going back to Bari. I spent a bit of more time with JV and his family, took a bath, then left for Binmaley.

A Dagupan, I walked a bit more from the bridge at Fernandez to Malimgas where I looked for the cheese donut place. I bought a couple, ate fried isaw, then ate bibingka. Then I went straight to Binmaley.

At Binmaley, I bonded with Cams and Bobet, slept for about an hour, then ate some more. I met Aldrich and Shane and learned that my sister is getting married.

The rest of the night is made of more booze time with Cams, getting to know Moymoy and Trisabelle (?), and singing on the karaoke.

I went home at Tita Vicky's place, called Lea, played some ML, then slept.
