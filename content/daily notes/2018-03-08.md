## I am grateful for:
1. Being healthy. I have not had any serious medical condition last year and my only visit to the doctor was with an infection. But aside from that, my resistance is a little more resilient.
2.  Being sane. I can't believe I am feeling more real. And its been a while now. Except when tapering my meds become troublesome, I don't have any symptom worthy of being insane. I am competent and able to perform what I want to do.
3.  This day. Another day given to me and the others to reverse the tide we created.

## What will I do to make today great

1.  Study logic.
2.  Plan your days.
3.  See if you can meet Kessy or JV + Goan.

## Affirmation

I am honest and humble. Searching for the truth with an open mind.

## 3 amazing things that happened today

1.  I read Chapter 11 one more time and finally I was able to clarify most of the things that I didn't understand at first.
2.  Tended my little garden again after quite some time.
3.  Didn't go out this afternoon but felt really ok being at home. No neighbors burned. No butterflies. No rats. I notice myself becoming less critical of mama and papa. This is great.
