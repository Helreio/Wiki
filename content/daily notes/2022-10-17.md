## I am grateful for:
1. Being here in front of the Carillion for, surprisingly, the first time.
2. A fun bonding time with Diwa and Ju last night.
3. The kitten Lea found. Looks like it came to her.

### Philosophy etc.

Wrote
- [[Our invisible Walden]]

I started studying the difference between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy. I started listening to a [podcast episode](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016x2jp) about the divide then read an [article](https://archive.nytimes.com/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/bridging-the-analytic-continental-divide/) about how to bridge the divide. I wrote a preliminary note on [[thoughts/continental philosophy]].

### Writing

I journaled about my morning walk with Lea, finding a kitten along the way, and reading *Kapag Natagpuan Kita*.

I read the foreword of *Kapag Natagpuan Kita*. I then tried to translate to Pangasinan Rofel Brion's poem Umaga/Morning. While translating, I discovered a [Pangasinan dictionary](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv9hvsfz) available to download online.

I continued reading Craig Mod's KIIII newsletter

Published the second issue of TLW on the site.

### Walking

I did a morning walk with Lea, hoping to read and journal outdoors. Instead, we found a kitten and Lea took it home. It rained after so I had to go home too.

I walked in the evening once more, at Pili Drive.

### Projects

### Others

- Performed a weekly review.
