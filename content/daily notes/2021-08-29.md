I am grateful for:

1. My time with friends and new acquaintances yesterday.
2. Our discussion about life work moves.
3. Being reminded of why I do my philosophy work, and how it should affect everything I do.

"I can articulate my beliefs in a gentle and right way."

Amazing

- I journaled about how I could be better at sharing my beliefs.
- Continued processing highlights from "How to take smart notes."
- I started writing about how my ideas about God changed.
- Continued watching Fan Girl.
- Started watching Money Heist part 2.
- Lea almost did it.
- Wrote and published [[Lilim, 02(06) â€” Familiar Comforts]]
