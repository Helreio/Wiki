## Review

Lea accompanied me to Agapita. After buying some baon, I rode the jeep to Calamba.

I rode the HM bus to Cubao then the Solid North bus to Pangasinan.

While in transit, I had a chat with Melchor Orpilla, a Pangasinan writer who has written a proposal for grammar and orthography of Pangasinan. I also finished reading Designing Your Life.

I arrived in Matic-Matic around 6 pm. A kind Kuya Oscar Bugayong had me ride with them in their tricycle.

I had dinner with my family then cut Chikako's nails.

I continued watching The Crown.
