## I am grateful for:
1. That grounding walk to Batis yesterday.
2. Reconnecting with Lea, feeling loved again, remembering all the good things in life.
3. This cool weather. The sky is overcast, but it is a rest from all those hot days of El Niño. A rest for the mind.

## Affirmation

"I can live as a writer-philosopher every day."
