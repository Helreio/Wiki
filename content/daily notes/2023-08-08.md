## I am grateful for:
1. Finding the book Better Boundaries Workbook. It speaks to me better. Makes me think for myself. I have found some resolution after just reading it for a while.
2. Yesterday's walk. I was able to write that vignette and see the train up close for the first time. I am starting to love that road.
3. Having parents who didn't micromanage us and allowed us to explore ourselves as children and be our own selves. It isn't ideal. But given everything, I will take it over a family that is too rigid.

## Affirmation

"It is healthy to prioritize my well-being."
