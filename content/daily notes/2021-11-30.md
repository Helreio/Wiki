I am grateful for:

1. Being able to buy kiat-kiat at Agapita.
2. The opportunity to see my friends today and catch up to them in person.
3. My walks.

"I will be present, fully present as I connect with my friends."

Amazing

- Went to Rem's place. The jeep's tire errupted a few yards near Rem's. So I walked.
- Saw Rem, Tita Cora, Gracielle, Joy, Jai, and Mamba
- Helped Rem prepare ingredients for Chicken Soy.
- Had lunch with Rem and Claire.
- Conversations about work, life work, poetry, proposing and marriage.
- Went home safely.
