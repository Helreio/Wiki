## I am grateful for:
1. Being able to understand what Claire is going through right now. Practicing compassion. Seeing what she is going through.
2. Trying out Elbi Commons for the first time. Their chicken meals are okay.
3. This silence once more.

## Affirmation

"Cleaning the house will be a practice of mindfulness."

## Review

After doing my morning routine, I cleaned our electric fans.

I had lunch while watching Peaky Blinders.

I then played Underlords.

By 3:00 pm, I walked to Sining Makiling to join Pagdiriwang. I experienced cooking in front of Freedom Park with Cha and the others.

We ate vegetarian pancit and tinuktok na tokwa. We then read poems. I read Ang Bahay by Rolando Tinio. We ended the celebration by singing and dancing Maui's song.

I walked at Aglibut-Pili-Rambutan-Ela before going home.

I played some Underlords.

I washed dishes then slept.
