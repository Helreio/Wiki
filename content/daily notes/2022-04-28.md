## Review
### Studies

I read Bruce Chatwin's essay "I Always Wanted to Go to Patagonia: The Making of a Writer."

I continued processing some notes still about purpose.

I looked at DIY MFA and discovered that its formula : writing with focus + reading with a purpose + building community is exactly the same advice CM gives to writers.

I started reading about reading with purpose and creating a reading list.

### Projects

### Others

- Went to Dagupan to see ate, Paeng, Via, and Briana go.
- Went to Booksale and browse through books. I bought a book with selections of Bruce Chatwin's writings. And a photo book about the meaning of life.
- Walked around town to taste my favorite turon, some hot donuts, and buko juice. I also bought boneless bangus pasalubong to Lea's family.
- Walked at Botao Carusocan road. Practiced being more mindful in nature and using it to trigger thoughts.
- Watched sex education. That episode was heartwarming.
