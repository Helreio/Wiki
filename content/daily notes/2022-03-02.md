I am grateful for:

1. Seeing Baguio intimately yesterday.
2. The establishments and things that have stayed the same.
3. Realizing by walking my life of dedication to a pursuit in the past - a life possible even until now.

"I can walk with dedication to a life of purpose."

# Review

## Studies

I finished reading "The History of Positive Psychology" by Froh: [https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Froh-2004.pdf](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Froh-2004.pdf). Its main thesis is that positive psychology owes a lot from humanistic psychology and yet it distances itself from it. He argues that only when positive psychology recognizes its past can it self-actualize.

I started reading “The Humanistic Psychology–Positive Psychology Divide by Waterman: [https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Humanistic-Positive-Psychology-Divide-AP.pdf](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Humanistic-Positive-Psychology-Divide-AP.pdf)
