I am grateful for:

1. Tantan's 7 years of existence. It was my privilege to see my very first nephew grow up into who he is right now. I miss the days when he was very little. I can feel what parents feel that they can't accept that their child is all grown up. I am happy that he has grown into a healthy and loving child.
2. This day. I can actually start working on my other creative projects as I wait for tomorrow.
3. A fun call with Lea last night.

"I will elevate the quality of my day."
