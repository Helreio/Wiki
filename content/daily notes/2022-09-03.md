## I am grateful for:
1. Finally taking home Poppy.
2. Finally understanding better how insurances work by talking with Nicco.
3. Last night's centering meditation. It has been a while since I last felt that. I need to do it more.

## Affirmation

"I am on my path to living a more secured life."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I read The Inward Morning and wrote [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-09-07-12]].

In the evening, I listened to a podcast by Andrew Brown about [navigating life without a blueprint](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1378024/6813751-s01-12-steps-not-steps-promises-and-the-art-of-metaphysical-hitchhiking). It was an amazing listen.

### Writing
- I started piecing together Uman August 2022.

### Photography

### Walking
- I walked along Royal Palm to Freedom Park on the road in front Baker Hall then walked at Pili Drive and back home via Ela.

### Projects

### Others
- I finished the first two parts of my monthly review.
- I updated Quartz.
- I wrote a letter for Claire and had it handwritten by Lea.
- Lea and I watched Argo.
