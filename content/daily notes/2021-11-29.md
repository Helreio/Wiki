I am grateful for:

1. A day by myself.
2. Being alive and relatively healthy.
3. The measure of freedom we are currently still experiencing.

"I am principled. I stand to my principles."

Amazing

- I wrote a message to Lea detailing my current stand on the vaccination issue and my challenge to her.
- I continued cleaning the house.
- I continued watching Arcane.
- I had a recentering walk at UP in the evening, realizing how much I enjoyed walks as a practice of appreciating beauty.
- Had a very fruitful convo with Lea where I was able to share my thoughts quite articulately.
