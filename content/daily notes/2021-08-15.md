Amazing

- Practiced patience with Claire and responded in a way that solves everything and strengthens our friendship.
- First time to taste Binakol (buko tinola).
- Had a really long and proper oracle reading with Care, who inspired me about choosing a path after church and surrendering.
- Tasted the carrot cake at Homespun.
- Funny: Claire asked me if I compare my weight before and after pooing.
