## I am grateful for:
1. Learning better about boundaries. I am able to understand better how to communicate them to the people I love.
2. Hearing those words from Lea last night about my writing. They mean a lot. To hear that I moved someone through my words is everything.
3. Reading those short stories from Anton Chekov. The first one especially was so great in detail. I was there. A picture, a motion picture was painted. The dialogue was also superb.

## Affirmation

"I know my boundaries. They reflect the life that I want. I protect them to protect the life that I want."
