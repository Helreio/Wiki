I am grateful for:

1. Lea being back here, truly feeling deeply in love.
2. Having to work for money.
3. The peace of mind, the composure, that I have now.

"I am in love."

Amazing

- I just enjoyed being around Lea, taking care of her, and being taken cared of.
- Had lunch at the new pares house at Lopez.
- Edited a really interesting screenplay.
- Saw the Great Barrington Declaration.
