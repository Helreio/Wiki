I am grateful for:

1. Champy for being so sweet.
2. The lack of vaccines. It is the only reason why vaccination is not mandatory. I hope it never will be.
3. Listening to Thomas Sowell and being reminded about the quest for truth. I can't wait to journal about this now.

"I defend truth."

Amazing
