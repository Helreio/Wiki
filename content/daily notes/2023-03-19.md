## I am grateful for:
1. A great sleep. I am well-rested and ready to take on the day.
2. Receiving an email from Cinque to do another round of OVIC overviews. This extends my contingency fund further giving me more time and space to play.
3. The outline that came to me last night while walking and the resolve to at least try writing an entry.

## Affirmation

"I am capable of finishing another round of overviews, finishing my work with Krys, and writing an entry for ANWW20."

## Review

Watched NHIE at lunch.

Worked on the Overviews.

Watched NHIE at dinner.
