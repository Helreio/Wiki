Amazing

- I journaled about primary purpose.
- I started reading an academic journal about the differences in the concept of the Self in Western and Eastern philosophy.
- I listened to a YouTube video talking about how the Buddha evaded metaphysical questions in favor of ethical teachings.
- I continued watching Money Heist.
- I used my PWD card to buy prescription meds for the first time and it was worth it. I saved P800+.
- I cooked sarciadong bangus for the first time in LB (I guess). I liked it. Lea loves it!
- We had a very wisdom-filled Fruit Salad session.
