I am grateful for:

1. The stories that Mama and Papa told us about their past. Even if they repeated the same stories (specially Papa), it was still fun to listen to them.
2. Claire's ginataang kalabasa.
3. Chikako for being healthy and here.

"The little things matter."

Amazing

- I decided to wait for the vlogger to finish his reviews before I decide and buy insurance.
- I walked and went to Claire's where I saw Tita Pet, talked to her, and get the kalabasa.
