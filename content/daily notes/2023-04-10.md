## Review

Wrote the following notes:

- [[Best WordPress themes]]
- [[Web hosting buying guide]]
- [[When I'm living a good day â€“ Clear]]
- [[Writing workshops and retreats]]

I continued thinking about my proposal for Candent.

Lea and I had lunch while watching Beef.

After lunch, I continued working on the proposal, writing a comprehensive audit of the site.

I had singkamas for merienda!

I played Underlords then walked to Madamba and Viado via Ela.

Lea and I had dinner.

After dinner, I did a weekly review then played Underlords.
