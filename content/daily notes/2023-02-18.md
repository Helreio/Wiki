## I am grateful for:
1. Receiving advice from Lea on how I could improve and optimize my LinkedIn profile.
2. Receiving feedback from Lea on how I could improve the cover letter I am writing.
3. Walking this morning.

## Affirmation

"I will make significant movements in my freelance business my freelance business setup."

## Review

In my journal, I wrote answers to Book Yourself Solid exercise on identifying my ideal clients.

I wrote a cover letter for the gig that Claire sent me and asked Lea for feedback then sent it.

In the evening, Kris Cabrera replied to me about the research writing role and arranged for a discovery call. I started preparing for the call by watching a video about discovery calls from the Freelance Tribe Movement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NWxkpskQIQ
