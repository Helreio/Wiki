## I am grateful for:
1. Ome for his generosity.
2. Lea, for doing her best to take care of me.
3. Having some energy to return to my morning routine and hopefully to accomplish some tasks today.

## Affirmation

"I am capable of moving on from regrets."

## Review

- Read stoic responses to regret.
- Journaled to process my regret.
- Did the essential oils protocol.
- I walked to Grove to get the ivermectin and to buy food.
- I confronted Lea about the reason why the videos she sent me were very short.
