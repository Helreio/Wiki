Amazing

- Ate ramen and takoyaki at issan ramen.
- Had a working date with Lea at Cafe Landia. Processed lots of notes
- I walked at UP. Realized that the rain can be an excuse for sitting down on one of the waiting sheds for longer.
- Inspired by Devine, I created a diagram of my categories of action.
- I continued watching Kingdom.
