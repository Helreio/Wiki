## I am grateful for:
1. Discovering the fish ponds near here. I saw a bato-bato perched on a long pole at the middle of the fish pond. It flew right above me hitting some leaves on the tree that gives me shade. Watching the waters calm my mind.
2. A really good sleep last night. I needed that to regain mental strength.
3. Seeing how my Tita Vick and Tito Francis is talking to each other makes me feel grateful that Papa and Mama (especially, Papa) is shows affection to my mother. Nevertheless, I feel challenged by this. How will I fare 10 years or more in a long-term relationship?
