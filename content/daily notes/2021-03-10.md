I am grateful:

1. The sun, the clear blue sky, the good weather.
2. Shorty for staying and accompanying me.
3. Alain de Botton

To do

“I am living a quiet but meaningful life.”

Amazing

- Went to Lipa with Lea. First time to go back to that place since high school. First time to go to a roadtrip with Lea since the pandemic.
- Saw a candle-making workplace for the first time.
- Met Ate Myrna, the restaurant-keeper who also makes pots, candles, and sculptures.
- Ate lunch at the candlelight cafe: chicken chezane, pasta, drinks
- Had lots of laughter
