I am grateful for:

1. Lea for the things she is willing to do for me.
2. This day that was given to me.
3. Tito Jun for being kind and concerned.

Amazing

- I journaled about the moderate-minded writer and the essay I didnt publish.
- I continued reading the moderate-minded writer.
- I processed some notes including HTTSN.
- I cooked ginataang sitaw at kalabasa using coconut milk I manually extracted lol.
- I finished watching Fangirl. It was ok but not something worth watching again.
- I started watching Mandy.
- I started looking for ways to go home to Pangasinan.
