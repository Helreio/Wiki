## I am grateful for:
1. Uwa's bravery. Not just for yesterday morning, but every single day of his life.
2. Witnessing Ms. An's return to ceramics, her love to it, her kindness and humility, and her joy.
3. Last night's hearty and story-filled dinner.

## Affirmation

"I am home. I really am home."

## Review

Lea and I went to Sunday Market to buy food.

Back at home, I continued reading Ocean Vuong and taking notes.

We had lunch while watching The Kominsky Method.

After lunch, I listened to Lea's podcast interview while working on the Ili pubmats.

I had siesta then continued doing the pubmats.

I played Underlords.

In the evening, Lea and I walked to Grove. We withdrew money, bought ingredients for sinigang na hipon, bought cat food, then had dinner at Second Floor Diner.

We walked a bit in UPLB then went home.

We watched Booksmart (a tearjerker dramedy).

I wrote some ideas about my walking workshop before going to bed.
