I am grateful for:

1. Arriving home safely yesterday and seeing that the cats are okay.
2. The opportunity to finally make sense of the vaccine.
3. Lea's love and understanding.

"I am brave. I could stand up to something I feel deeply about."

Amazing

- Started doing closer research on the Covid vaccine and saw a lot of info I've never seen before.
- Ate batil patung for lunch.
- Lea and I made tacos for dinner.
- Started watching Game Over, Man!
