I am grateful for:

1. Andy's reminder, example, and inspiration for what constitutes a serious daily creative practice.
2. This quiet Monday morning.
3. The opportunity to pay attention to the things I value the most.

"I am dedicated to the practice of the mind."

Amazing

- Tried making the most out of my morning. I journaled and studies until 12 noon.
- Vacuumed the entire house for the first time.
- Walked to UP briefly.
- Watched American Hustle with Lea.
