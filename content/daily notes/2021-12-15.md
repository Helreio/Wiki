I am grateful for:

1. Sleeping last night with no pajamas and socks and I had no flea bites whatsoever!
2. The study session yesterday. It was really fun.
3. Mama's improvement in managing her diabetes.

Fieldnotes

The goodness of a life should never be judged by external conditions that are outside the control of the person. It should be judged by how that person responds to these external conditions. No matter how much bad happened to a person, he still lived a good life if in those moments where he was in control, he did his best according to his values and goals.
