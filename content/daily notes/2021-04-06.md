I am grateful for:

1. Being able to enter UP to buy yogurt and contiue my nutritional regimen.
2. Scott Kaufman for triggering me to rethink my purpose.
3. Being able to hold ground and not open the internet until I do journaling for the second straight day.

“It’s okay if I lose friends in FB. We need to make spaces for ourselves. I need to feel comfortable doing the same. But it’s not the most important thing in the world.”

Amazing

- I was starting to apply Be the Gateway, but it asked me what narratives do I believe in and this led me to reading Transcend chapter on Purpose.
- Received laptop stand and used it.
- Walked to Public Market via the back way and blocked by soldiers.
- Watched video about my current Macbook Pro and convinced to upgrade it instead of buying new.
- Watched Homeland.
- Shared to Lea some of the things I learned from reading Transcend and Be the Gateway. I also shared my own insight which I wrote at my talakahon a while ago.
