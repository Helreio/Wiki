## I am grateful for:
1. Being exposed to Lea's world and being inspired to help her even more.
2. Being able to share to Lea about what I am currently studying about the philosophy of religion.
3. Surviving the first week of living with Lea in a long-term arrangement.

## Affirmation

"Be who you really are no matter what."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about the possibility of my life work having a religious element.

I wrote the following notes:
- [[Things I had in my past religious life I can incorporate in my current life]]
- [[A comparison of my past religious life and my life today]]

I then processed my highlights from the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on [[Religion]].

I browsed the Facebook page of the Unitarian Universalist Church of the Philippines and saw how it, indeed, looks like a typical church. It made me cringe and convinced me to stick to what I am doing: constructing a personal religion.
