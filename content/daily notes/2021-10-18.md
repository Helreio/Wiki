I am grateful for:

1. Being treated well by Tita Remy.
2. Fun bonding with Josa and Lea's sibs.
3. Reading about Montaigne's life work.

"I am a philosopher and essayist."

Amazing

- I journaled about Montaigne.
- I read two chapters from Montaigne's biography.
- I processed the last diary entries on my sexuality.
- I processed the Evernote notes on moving on from a breakup.
- I watched the first episode of Squid Game.
- I walked to UP.
