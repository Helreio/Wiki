I am grateful for:

1. 2020. A very challenging but wonderful year. It is both difficult and enriching. It will be one of the most exemplary years of my life. I learned a lot. I grew a lot. And yet there is so much more to do.
2. The relatively quiet celebration of New Year last night from this part of the world. I would wish a more engaged celebration. But I have dogs with me. And I feel for them.
3. This new year, my state of mind as compared to last year's new year, when the tinnitus really bothered me, almost forcing a panic attack—something I never had for years. That night was difficult. I slept with earphones on drowning the noise. I am grateful I have habituated from it.
