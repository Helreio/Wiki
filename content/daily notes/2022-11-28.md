## Affirmation

"I am on my way to finding the ideal day job."

## Review

I journaled about the process of finding the next day job. I wrote the characteristics of the job I am looking for. I reflected on the quote by [[thich nhat hanh]]: "[[the feeling that any task is a nuisance - thich nhat hanh]]."

Transferred the poem [[poems/kung paano tayo magpapatuloy]] in my forest garden.

Published [[tlw/007]] in the website.

Lea and I watched The Crown while having lunch.

I fixed Git in my computer by reinstalling Xcode Command Line tools.

I did a weekly review.

Encountered the work of Bernadette Mayer, ["Memory"](https://www.bernadettemayer.com/memory-1?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)

I watched The Crown while having dinner.

Lea and I walked to 7 eleven to buy booze and chips then went home to drink.
