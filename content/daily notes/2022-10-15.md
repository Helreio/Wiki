## I am grateful for:
1. This beautiful sunny Saturday. An opportunity to re-walk Rofel Brion and to celebrate the launch of his new book.
2. Ate Nancy and his crew for making me feel welcome. A warm place to be in.
3. The Rings of Power for a wonderful season 1.

## Affirmation

"I am a poet celebrating a fellow poet's achievement."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

While traveling, I read some articles from Austin Kleon's newsletter:
- [Starting from scraps](https://austinkleon.com/2022/10/12/starting-from-scraps/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)
- ['It felt like a funeral'](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/oct/11/it-felt-like-a-funeral-william-shatner-reflects-on-voyage-to-space?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)

At the launch, I talked with Rem about lyrical philosophy, his current state with iching, why Los Ba√±os did not birth creative wellness, why academia is the cause for why there are no art scenes in many places in the Philippines.

### Writing

While journaling, I read a few poems from Rofel Brion's book *Nang Matagpuan Kita*. Inspired by his mala-haiku style, I tried emulating it. I wrote a poem about my frequent love affair with Champy: [[poems/rests]] or [[translations/mga pahinga]] and GP Roperos translated it into Spanish, [[translations/descansos]].

I re-listened to the [podcast interview of Kevin Chan to Rofel Brion](https://www.kevinnchan.com/2020/11/24/radio-ep-8-rofel-brion/) and took notes under the note [[contacts/rofel brion]].

In the afternoon, I went to Casa San Pablo to attend Rofel Brion's book launch, a most exciting event that provided me with a much-needed creative boost.
