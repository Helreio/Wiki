## I am grateful for:
1. Austin Kleon. I have said it before but will say it again. He helps me feel like what I am doing is okay. He gives me permission to play.
2. This last day of work.
3. Freedom.

## Affirmation

"I will make the most of the next 25 free days."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

While doing my weekly review:
- I read Ben Hewitt's That Good Feeling and through him, listened to Zach Bryan's Burn, Burn, Burn, which I like.
- Found Minor Feelings by Cathy Park Hong per Craig Mod.
- Read a post from Tammy Strobel's new newsletter: [Digital Simplicity](https://tammystrobel.substack.com/p/digital-simplicity)
- Through Tammy's post, I discovered [Die with Zero](https://www.diewithzerobook.com/welcome?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email), a book that is now in my reading list.
- I also subscribed to The Pause by Krista Tipett.

I thought about managing [[My reading inbox]]. I consolidated all notes with reading lists in them into a single note ([[My reading list]]). I will be filtering this list and removing books I won't read. All books I will read, I will download ebooks then put into my reading inbox on Mac. I might look for a way to convert Instapaper posts to PDF so they go to the Mac folder too.
