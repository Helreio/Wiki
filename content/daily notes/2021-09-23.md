I am grateful for:

1. Fruit Salad for allowing me to have a space to cultivate my ideas in palatable form.
2. The flow I went to discussing life management system last night.
3. Watching the symposium and expanding my understanding of the virus issue.

"I am an expert in knowledge management."

Amazing

- I read the exchanges between DCE and EMA.
- Watched the second part of the Symposium where the PCR test was proven to be ineffective.
- I walked in UP forestry.
- I chatted with Sarah about vaccination.
