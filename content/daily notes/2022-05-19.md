## I am grateful for:
1. Me inching closer into getting a health insurance.
2. The walking shorts I saw and bought yesterday.
3. This day. An opportunity to pursue my purpose and mission.

## Affirmation

"I know how to articulate, communicate, and protect my boundaries."

## Review
### Studies

I journaled about the highlights of my recent trip to Lopez, Quezon.

Wrote: 
- [[Rural Philippines and the mystery of inner life]]
- [[Freedom will never be fully optimmized]]

Published Lilim 03(01) on the blog and shared it on my story.

### Projects

**My Writing Life**

Continued reading Desert Solitaire.

I applied for a student discount in Ulysses and got it.

**Insurance**

I checked out AIA All in One.

I listened to a few episodes in Afford Anything about life and health insurance. I also read one article about the subject. I learned that insurance is actually bankruptcy protection for the worst case scenario, and so if you think of it that way, you can opt to get just a health insurance that is cheap rather than one that is expensive, while saving your own health.

### Others

- Continued watching Better Call Saul.
- Warriors beat Mavs in Game 1.
- I wasn't feeling good, so I decided to take a walk.
