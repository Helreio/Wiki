I am grateful for:

1. Having Lea around.
2. Having the cats around.
3. Life challenges and distractions.

"I will approach the problem calmly."

Amazing

- Journaled about how I will address the iphone's signal problem with emotional maturity.
- Went out to buy some goods.
- Continued watching and taking notes on my skin care project.
- I started watching Craig Mod's live stream of packing.
- In Fruit Salad, we started watching Daniel Pink's Masterclass on sales and persuasion.
