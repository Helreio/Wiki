I am grateful for:

1. Another recentering walk yesterday.
2. Relatively no bites last night. Had a better sleep.
3. The opportunity to meet Lea's friends.

"I'll be showing who I am in front of these strangers."

Amazing

- Lea and I ate lunch at a turo-turo.
- Lea and I traveled to Manila. I set foot in there for the first time since the pandemic started. Almost two years ago.
- Met Chef, Riane, and JA.
- Had a great time playing fold-it, ticket to ride, and citadels.
- Ate delicious shawarma.
- Watched Suicide Squad 2.
