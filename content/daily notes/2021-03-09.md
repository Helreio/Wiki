I am grateful for:

1. This new desk, quite possibly the most important part of my workspace. I am happy with its simplicity. It allows me to connect with nature outside.
2. Diwa. For trusting me with her personal space while she is away. I feel like this seals our friendship. It levels it up.
3. This free day. I want to make the most of it.
