I am grateful for:

1. Mindfulness, stoicism, CBT, and everything that I have learned about preserving the peace of my mind for so many years.
2. The opportunity to practice what I learned through this encounter with Diwa.
3. Everything turning out well.

“I have an amazing circle.”

Amazing

- I sent a message to Diwa expressing my feelings after receiving the message. She responded really well.
- Started looking for a web development course and found freecodecamp. I started studying through their platform.
- I went to the market and grocery to buy some supplies.
- I started a weekly review.
