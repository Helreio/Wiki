## I am grateful for:
1. Receiving the good news from Krys that the proposal was sent and there will be no more revisions to be made.
2. Finishing two overview updates yesterday.
3. Getting some more clarity on how I will write the essay entry.

## Affirmation

"I am brave"

## Review

I continued working on the OVIC overviews.

I also continued working on additional revisions for the Inclusion paper.

While having lunch, Lea and I started watching Making a Murderer.

In the afternoon, I finished working on the OVIC overviews.

I had merienda while reading [[Walking as a Way of Knowing - Amoroso]].

I then played Underlords.

I walked to Forestry and spent around 30 minutes sketching ideas for the [[Entry to ANWW20]] on my journal.

When I got home, I continued reading Walking as a Way of Knowing while having dinner.

I played more Underlords, then I prepared to sleep.
