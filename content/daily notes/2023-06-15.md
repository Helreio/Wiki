## I am grateful for:
1. Witnessing my younger sister get married.
2. Introducing Lea to my extended family members.
3. Wherever I am right now in my life.

## Affirmation

"I am free. I am happy. I am peace."

## Review

Woke up early to prepare and attend Bernice's wedding ceremony.

Weird to see faces of people I left at Baguio (Zay Araos and Janet Domingo).

Found our way to Adriano's.

Enjoyed the food and company of relatives.

Went home to sleep.

Continued reading On Writing Well.

Started watching Solaris.

Migs drove Lea and I to Naro, a superb restaurant.

Drove around Lingayen before arriving home at Binmaley.
