I am grateful for:

1. Learning that Andy Matuschak actually uses Bear to edit his Evergreen notes.
2. Finally sending that message to Mama telling her that I plan to transfer to Laguna this month. It marks a step forward into my plans.
3. The freedom that I currently enjoy. Not everyone has this freedom to actually write down what they are grateful for in their lives. And yet I can. That is amazing.

To do:

- [ ] Continue writing highlights of the months.
- [ ] Write my Highlights of 2020 in narrative form.
- [x] Try exporting some notes from Roam to Bear.

“I am afraid but that’s okay. It means that I am going towards the right direction—towards growth.”

Amazing:

- Explored Bear Notes. Transferred all existing Roam notes into it, formatted them, and organized them into PARA using tags.
- Tita Nok gave me the wire for free as well as the face shields.
- I finally told Mama about my plans to transfer to Laguna.
- First time to buy food at Macy’s eatery. Brent cooked the veggies.
- Listened to Lea talk about the questions she uses to review her year.
