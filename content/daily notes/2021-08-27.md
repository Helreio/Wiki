I am grateful for:

1. Maui for thinking about me.
2. My recentering walk last night. It reminded me how much I need to walk and use it for creative regeneration too.
3. Good Boys. It was really a fun movie.

"I have a meaningful life."

Amazing

- Journaled about why I am doing philosophy.
- I got to taste Lea's pork sinigang.
- Finished Scribendi. Free at last.
- Started watching Fan Girl.
