## I am grateful for:

1. Chikako
2. The experience of walking on a vacuumed house
3. The reminder about my priorities

## Affirmation

"I can fix my sleep."

## Review

- Walked to Forestry for the first time after a while.
- Continued watching HIMYM
- I dreamt that something bad happened to Kako, asked how she is to mama, she didn't reply fast, but when she replied, she sent cute photos.

STUDY LOG

- I decided to focus on writing the Talahardin structure note as a minimum viable study process and integrate processing ultralearning and HTTSN later on.
- I journaled about how writing walking narratives fit in my morning writing routine and my workflow in general.
- I read the foreword of Thinking While Walking by Bunzl and wrote notes on some highlights. I also thought about walking more and how to make good use of walking narratives.
- I articulated different options of sharing frequency.
- I started processing “A Mind Like Water” outline.
