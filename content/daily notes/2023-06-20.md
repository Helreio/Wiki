## I am grateful for:
1. Discovering Elementor, which is making my work a lot simpler.
2. Being with family yesterday lunch and visiting San Jacinto and Manaoag.
3. An insightful journaling session about what I would do next with walking, couples by insights I had while walking in the evening yesterday.

## Affirmation

"I will be free soon."

## Review

Continued working on Ili's website design.

After lunch, I traveled to Binmaley to bond with Migs.

Bonded with Migs and Raymond and Mitch and their kids: karaoke and wine.
