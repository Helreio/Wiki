## I am grateful for:
1. Maui, for existing, for welcoming me into her life and circle, for the inspiration she brings to all of us, for the beauty she sees and gives to us.
2. Yesterday, for being one of those days that I won't ever forget.
3. My friends, my circle. Despite being in this liminal space, I still feel part of something.
