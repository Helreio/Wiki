## Review

We started the day with [[ANWW20 Jehu Laniog]] then [[ANWW20 Hunny Laurente]] and [[ANWW20 Jesa Suganob]].

We then had a graduation ceremony.

After which, we read some of our works. I read [[Isang Tahanang Tatawagin Nating “Bukas”]].

We drank together at Heaven. Had more convos with Elio, Sir Vince, and Martin.

Went back at Ateneo past 12 and had the room again for myself.
