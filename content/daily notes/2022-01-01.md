# 2022.01.01

I am grateful for:

1. A really lovely evening with Lea and her family. Seeing all those fireworks. Having all those food. I am thankful.
2. Discovering Jamstack and finding a clearer direction in this project. I am even more convinced that developing this skill is something I want to do.
3. 2021 for everything, every amazing thing that year brought me.

I did a redo of a Scribendi order.

We had brunch outside Lea’s house.

We played anomia again.

I did my monthly financial review.

I walked at UP: Velasco-Narra-Juliano-Royal Palm.

I wrote my daily review report.

I listened to Tame Impala’s album Currents. It was really good!
