## I am grateful for:

1. My freedom, of course. This will be a lengthier freedom. I am grateful to go back to where the stars are.
2. Seeing Rem, Ome, and Bevs yesterday. I am grateful for being around my friends no matter how busy they are.
3. My peace of mind. My truest most precious possession.

## Affirmation

"I am an explorer of the deepest oceans of the soul."

# Review

## Studies

- I journaled about my creative family tree, which starts with Thoreau at the center.
- I also wrote about how often I should publish my writing vis a vis the daily creative work that I dedicate myself into.
- I also wrote about the importance of always letting the structural talk to the individual, when thinking about anything. In my current case, when deciding what to write.
- I also wrote about how I could incoporate narratives into my Talahardin.
- I started reading Thoreau’s A Week.
- I read a series of blog posts on using zettelkasten to analyze and write fiction ([https://zettelkasten.de/fiction/](https://zettelkasten.de/fiction/)).
- I also started reading Thoreau’s essay “A Life Without Principle” ([https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1863/10/life-without-principle/542217/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1863/10/life-without-principle/542217/)).
