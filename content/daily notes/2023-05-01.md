## I am grateful for:
1. Everything that happened in April. It was a month of community, joy, getting out of our comfort zone, and being as present to each other as possible.
2. Froi's reassuring advice about what I could expect from the ANWW20 and the mindset I need to bring to it.
3. Having started the proposal for Candent and the possibility of sending it now.

## Affirmation

"I will make the most out of this dayâ€”suck all the marrow out of it."

## Review

After my morning reading and writing routine, I worked on the last pubmats for the Ilihan workshops, which earned me P1,200.

I also started layouting the Candent proposal in Canva.

We had lunch while watching Ted Lasso.

I continued working on the Candent proposal. I tried to form a proper project strategy and timeline.

I played Underlords then walked to Pili Drive. I discovered a new trail, the other branch of the NLAI walks that led me back to Rambutan Road.

Back home, we had dinner while watching Ted Lasso.

After dinner, I performed a monthly financial review.

I played some more Underlords then washed the dishes.

I prepared to sleep.
