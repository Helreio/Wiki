## I am grateful for:
1. Bringing Lea at WhyNot Coffee. Seeing her enjoy the food a lot and me myself experiencing their waffle with chicken.
2. Arriving here at Naguilayan safely despite the long ride.
3. The entire ANWW20 experience. I still feel beyond grateful.

## Affirmation

"I am a creative writer."
