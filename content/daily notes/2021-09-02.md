I am grateful for:

1. Being able to share about what I am currently doing in life and career, particularly about my position on food.
2. The insights I had while processing my diary entry on beliefs.
3. Seeing chikako so lively and happy.

"I speak my truth without imposing it or hurting anyone."

Amazing

- I journaled more about how I'm going to use the newsletter better.
- Processed notes on purpose and intuition.
- I started watching Driveways.
- I wrote [[2021-08 Monthly report]].
- Diwa sent her condolences for Doji's death.
- Lea and I watched In Good Style.
