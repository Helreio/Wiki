I am grateful for:

1. Seeing the potential of walking in Laguna.
2. Seeing those weird dragonflies that fly like butterflies and those birds that has a similar color and who flew just above my head.
3. Realizing that continuing exposing myself to Gian isn't a good way to spend my minimal time.

"I am a good collaborator."

Amazing

- I continued writing the HEAL piece.
- I tried the laundry service nearby. Superb!
- Went out to look for some clothes.
- First time to withdraw funds using my ING card. No fees!
- I pulled the trigger and bought an iphone 11 pro.
- I realized I want to start taking better care of my skin. I started researching the basics.
- I bought a cleanser and tested for my skin type. I'm an oily type.
