## I am grateful for:
1. Being away from Pangasinan and not having to deal with these stuff. Now I just have to get it out of my head.
2. Yesterday's work. It actually feels good to be able to do my job well.
3. Being able to fix the pvc pipe.

## Affirmation

"I have the ability to avoid giving a fuck to unimportant stuff."

## Review
