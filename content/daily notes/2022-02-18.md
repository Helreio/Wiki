# 2022.02.18

I am grateful for:

1. A good sleep last night.
2. The opportunity to rethink about my purpose, vision, and mission.
3. The opportunity to articulate who I am now and what I stand for.

"I know who I am and what I want to do. I just have to articulte it."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about what I am going to write in my about and home pages.

## Projects

### VinceImbat.com

I wrote a minimum viable copy for both my home and about pages.

I finalize the posts to publish in the new site and downloaded the drafts from the old site.

I edited the file sizes of the images to optimize my site.

I added a favicon on my site (just a head shot).

I then uploaded my site to cloudflare and pointed my domain to it.

I also deleted the site in bluehost.

I fixed the Mailerlite forms in my site.

I also studied how to use email forwarding to use a custom email add. I used the Forward Email service.

I also used Zuolanâ€™s technique to set up custom domain in my Talahardin in Craft. To make this work, I deleted the redirect in Bluehost.
