## I am grateful for:
1. Being able to hold my attention in place this morning. No internet since waking up 7:30.
2. Because I was able to avoid the internet, I was able to write my morning pages and there was an insight worth writing a note about at the end.
3. Tammy Strobel, for reminding me that writing a newsletter and practicing personal essay writing does not have to be difficult. She did attend a workshop in the past. But her writing just feels effortless.

## Affirmation

“I engage my audience in a way that feels good.”

## Review
