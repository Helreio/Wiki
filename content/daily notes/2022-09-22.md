## I am grateful for:
1. The opportunity today to see my friends.
2. Getting quite far in my reading of The Gift and getting a clearer understanding of Lewis' stance.

## Affirmation

"I will keep my heart, mind, and schedule open today to accomodate friendship."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about how [[The art of living is my gift]].

I continued reading The Gift, particularly the chapter on Walt Whitman.

### Writing

### Photography

### Walking

### Projects

### Others
- Traveled to Las Pi√±as to bond with friends. We had lunch at a Thai restaurant. Then we went around the subdivision. We then stayed at Dear Joe to watch the sunset and have convos. Then had pizza at YOLO Diner.
