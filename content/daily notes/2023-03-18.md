## I am grateful for:
1. Being inspired to at least try if I could apply at the Ateneo Writing Workshop.
2. Learning about Sir Rofel's workshop, an opportunity to get closer to him and build a relationship further.
3. Being able to articulate my thoughts to Claire in writing.

## Affirmation

"I am brave to do something closer to who I want to be everyday."

## Review

In my journal, I wrote about how a poem can be misinterpreted, or better, expand through new meaning it gets from readers. I also wrote about how I can focus my editing and proofreading improvement project.

I continued my metalearning project for editing and proofreading improvement. I discovered Gramlee and Polished Paper.

Lea and I had lunch while watching Never Have I Ever.

I received a new set of overviews from Cinqu√©, which I accepted.

I then started reading about autoethnography through the article [View of Autoethnography: An Overview](https://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/1589/3095). I continued doing so while having merienda.

I played Underlords.

I walked at Pili via Ela. While walking, I came up with a sketch of the [[Entry to ANWW20]].

Then I met Lea at Cadapan for dinner.

I played some more Underlords then did some chores downstairs.

I fixed the clog at the bathroom sink!

Before meditating, I sent a response to Claire's question about what could give Diwa and Bevs assurance inside Tungko.
