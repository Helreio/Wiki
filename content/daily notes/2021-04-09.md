I am grateful for:

1. These continuous influx of insights about what kind of creative work I want to do and how I could do it. I am having insights I never had in the past while in Pangasinan and while I didn’t have a method like Zettelkasten to support me.
2. The space that I have right now - both time and physical space - that is so conducive to my creative pursuits.
3. Meeting Ome, experiencing his work, and being affected by his passion.

Amazing

- I finished reading "Be the Gateway".
- I started level 1 PS for Be the Gateway.
- Watched Master of None S1E3.
- Watched The Midnight Sky.
