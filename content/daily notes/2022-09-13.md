## I am grateful for:
1. The insight to continue focusing on what I know I will enjoy doing but introduce a business concept to help make it sustainable.
2. All the inspirations that came my way all these years.
3. A new day to pursue my dreams and goals.

## Affirmation

"I will pursue my dream intentionally and mindfully."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about how I can transition into a business closer to joy.

Wrote the following notes:
- [[Rewalking highlights the contrast in space]]
- [[thoughts/business ideas adjacent to my interests]]

### Writing

Received email from TLDTD that their fifth issue with my poem is coming out on September 18.

Included a poetry idea in my forest garden to deveolop: [[poems/nadulas]].

### Photography

### Walking

- Walk with Lea to batis.

### Projects

[[projects someday/career planning]]
- I started exploring alternatives to retirement, particularly building a career you don't have to retire from. [[Scott Young]]'s article [Fantasizing About Retirement? Here's How to Build a Career You Won't Want to Quit](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/05/20/fantasizing-about-retirement-heres-how-to-build-a-career-you-wont-want-to-quit/) came to my radar. Through the article, I came into contact again with his course Top Performer, which he runs with [[Cal Newport]].
- I explored Top Performer. Through it, I learned about the [[Career capital theory]].
- I listened to four podcast episodes by Scott Young, which gives some preview of what is in Top Performer.
- I also read some reviews of the course, which made it more valuable:
	- [Review by Mike Mallow](https://medium.com%2F@medium.com/@mwmalloy/top-performer-how-to-be-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you-fe61fa16255e#.n5w3bkxfs)
	- [A thread at Quora](https://www.quora.com/If-youre-a-programmer-whos-taken-the-top-performer-course-by-Scott-Young-and-Cal-Newport-was-it-worth-the-500-cost?encoded_access_token=74438ba512ff48e48d7d6546e63c266f&force_dialog=1&provider=google&success=True)
	- [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/q0p248/comment/hfcp4xe/)
- I also read [Lessons Learned from 5 years and 5000+ Students in Top Performer](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2021/10/01/top-performer-2/)
- I looked for alternative books and found (again) the book *Designing Your Life*. Interestingly, both this book and Top Performer suggests interviewing people who have the career you want and extracting their stories.

### Others
- Continued watching Community.
- Ate at Goto Have It for the first time with Lea.
- Did my weekly review.
