I am grateful for:

1. Lea and our conversation this morning.
2. Fixing the Scribendi problem last night.
3. The monitor for working.

"I prioritize the things that truly matter."

Amazing

- Ate lunch at Food Garage.
- Keyboard arrived but still wasn't able to use the setup because of the adapter problem.
- Walked to Grove and Agapita.
- Watched Red Notice with Lea.
- Finished editing the last essay for this month.
