## I am grateful for:
1. This reminder that I need to simplify my life.
2. The opportunity to look back into the past and write about it.
3. Being a better version of myself, giving Ton the benefit of the doubt, seeing the good in him, trusting.

## Affirmation

"I strive to always see the good in others first."

## Review

I was able to make significant progress in revising the essay for Palanca.

I started playing with Rem's website. First, I tried creating a site via Hugo.

Lea and I met Dan and Kris Ann for lunch at Selina's then merienda at Taza Mia. We then walked to UP, first at Kris Ann's college, then to Sining Makiling, and then to OTOP.

I continued walking by myself to Madamba then Viado.

I played with using a free hosting by x10hosting to host Pathfinder's commune while having dinner. I used this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKqjRz9zoog
