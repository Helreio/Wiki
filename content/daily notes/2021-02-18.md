I am grateful for:

1. Not being hopeless in terms of what I can do to solve my throat problem. I deeply believe I can still do changes to correct what has happened.
2. Being able to articulate my thoughts and questions last night in Rem’s workshop on loving-kindness.
3. Finally reaching out to a potential peer.
