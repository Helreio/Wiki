I am grateful for:

1. Meeting Bevs, Maui, and Yano yesterday. I went home more inspired to live my life. Bevs asked me questions and seem to be really interested. The others not much. But their lives and stories were inspiring.
2. Meeting the dogs: Alpha, Tuldok, and Dos. They all had their own origin stories before arriving in their current lives. I am so grateful that they found these loving keepers. They deserve the life they now have.
3. Learning that there are possibly better options for where to live here in LB. Another project to think more about this year.

“Better days are ahead of me in terms of my life work. Better days.”

Amazing

- Lunch: Mungo balls
- Just worked.
- Rode the jeep from LB to Calamba and watched the way. Saw Pansol and Bukal.
- Walked from Halang to Lea's house. I got lost along the way.
- Worked at Lea’s house and had dinner (nilagang baboy).
- Tricycle driver made a mistake and brought me to the wrong terminal. I had to walk towards the correct one. It was a learning experience.
- Went home, sat in front of the jeepney, and realized how far LB really is from Calamba.
