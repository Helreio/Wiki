## I am grateful for:
1. Champy finally receiving medications that will hopefully make her feel better.
2. Having some extra resource to afford this additional expense this month.
3. The several opportunities for me to make money this January.

## Affirmation

"Things will get better! There will be brighter days ahead."

## Review

This was the first no-rain sunny day of the year. It was a gift! I wrote about it in my journal as well as my morning walk with Lea and appreciation of the neighborhood.

I started reading a new chapbook: Rofel Brion's *May Nagsabi Sa Akin*.

I played around the fonts for my Obsidian and changed the accent color to pale coral.

I then jumped right into researching and updating the esports overview piece. This is what I did for the rest of the day.

At lunch, Lea and I watched two episode of the Russian Doll including its season finale. It was a good watch.

In the afternoon, I walked at Viado—Madamba—Argañosa—Pili—Aglibut—Dawis—Ela, bought dinner, and watched an episode of Katla.

I then fetched Lea at Meister's and went home with her together. We fixed our newly washed clothes and used the burrito to give Champy 1-TDC.

Claire gave tea from Canada while Diwa and Ju gave us blended cat food to use to give Champy her meds.
