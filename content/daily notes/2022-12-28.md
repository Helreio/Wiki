## I am grateful for:
1. Spending time with friends last night, engaging in invigorating conversations and playing Ticket to Ride (finally!).
2. My new office and room filled with lots of natural light.
3. This opportunity to move my projects.

## Affirmation

"2023 is going to be a great year!"

## Review

In my journal, I listed my current active projects that will stay active until the end of January. I specified the goals for Lea's LMS. I also thought about projects I could start by the second half or end of January.

I created the following notes:
- [[translations/singa karuman labat]]
- [[poems/ang mapakinggan mo]]

After reading it from Andy Matuschak's daily routine, I bought the Forest app and used it. I find the experience really motivating. It builds momentum.

I discovered the term [[dead week per fitzgerald]] from Helena Fitzgerald via Austin Kleon. It refers to the days between December 25 to New Year.

Lea and I had lunch (ginataang manok) while watching an episode of Community.

In the evening, I walked to Forestry in one of those grounding walks. The wind felt really good and my mind was relativel sharp. I captured a few seeds along the way.

Back at home, we had dinner while watching Oro, Plata, Mata, a brilliant classic Filipino film.
