I am grateful for:

1. The discipline to conduct these reviews. Even if they take time and they don't always produce the best emotions, I know they help me in subtle ways.
2. Lea for taking care of my cats.
3. Emily's work and the insights I learned from her masterclass so far.

"I have a deep understanding of myself."

Amazing

- I finished pruning my Talakahon.
- I rode my bike to Tebag and out in Matic Matic then I explored the irrigation road behind Balon Dalan.
- I finished watching Rurouni Kenshin 1.
- I finished watching Emily's masterclass.
- I applied Emily's masterclass to Lea.
