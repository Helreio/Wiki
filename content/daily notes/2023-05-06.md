## I am grateful for:
1. The friends I have now. I seldom feel the loneliness I felt in Pangasinan and even in the first year I was in LB. I am more connected and integrated in my community.
2. This morning. A few hours to read, write, and move some projects.
3. Cari

## Affirmation

"I will be fully present to Benjie and Joji later. I will offer my presence and attention mindfully to attend to their needs."

## Review

We had lunch.

We met Maui and Yano at Micha's to get their padala for Benjie.

We asked Maui to suggest what to buy as pasalubong.

Then we traveled to Alabang. The trip was relatively easy.

Benjie met as at Alabang Star Mall. We chatted along the way.

At Candent, we met Gabriel, Ate Irene, and Kuya Ronnie.

Joji was there and we bonded over coffee and chips for a while before resting.

Then we went out around 7 pm for dinner.

We had dinner at Altrove. That was where I got approval of the proposal from both Benjie and Joji.

We then had dessert at Dylan's Patisserie

After dinner, we retired to our bedrooms.
