I am grateful for:

1. This view. As long as I don't find a place that gives me this view, I am not living. I have been in a state of flow here. I know I can achieve that here despite all the possible challenges. Tita Edna is good. She can be reasoned with.
2. Last night’s thought-provoking conversations about love and its metaphysical status. Rem’s work on this is developed. His thinking of this is rich. I still think he is a colleague. He reminded me of the real work I intend to do in my relationship with others, my practice of amoralism.
3. Jomer’s help last night.

To do:

- [x] Morning writing practice
- [x] Continue summarizing How to take smart notes
- [x] Check Karlo’s house
- [x] Buy ingredients for the recipe of the day.

“It’s time to create love.”

Amazing

- PS1 How to Take Smart Notes - Literature Notes
- Checked Karlo’s apartment as well as Tita Teresita’s apartment. The surroundings were quiet and good.

- Talked to Lea (told her about the P50 rule, facing this as a challenge, love, etc.)
