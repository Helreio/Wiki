I am grateful for:

1. Being able to work in Scribendi, a job I can control my time and how much work I do. Plus the work can be absorbing too, gives me a way to put my mind somewhere else.
2. Being in a situation where I don't have to fall in line just to get food. I know people need this very badly at these kind of times. Seeing that in front of my eyes makes me feel empathy to them but also grateful.
3. My family being relatively okay back in Pangasinan despite everything happening there.

"I am very blessed."

Amazing

- I finished my last Scribendi assignment.
- Watched Alias Grace.
- Cooked bangus in ampalaya leaves.
- Ate the lelot balatong that tita anet gave me yesterday.
