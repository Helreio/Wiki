I am grateful for:

1. Seeing my family again after two months.
2. Bringing Lea here and having her welcomed by my family really well.
3. Ju agreeing to feed the cats until Thursday.

"I am loved. I feel loved."

Amazing

- Lea and I walked to alog and journaled under the mango tree.
- A smaller goat peed in front of Lea then pooped. I saw its penis. First time to see a goat's penis. It's weird.
- Started pruning my Talahardin. I was able to improve some notes using the principle of atomicity.
- Introduced Lea to Tito Joel and Tita Jessica.
- Walked with Lea at irrigation road.
