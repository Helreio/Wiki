I am grateful for:

1. This amazing morning pages session. I was able to transform those perplexing news back home to a deeply rich meditation and reflection. This one is so powerful I might write about this on my next Lilim.
2. Freedom app for successfully blocking my ios sites until this time. Tomorrow, I will completely block messaging apps and sites until lunch.
3. Successfully uprooting myself from that place in Pangasinan. And replanting myself here where I have a better chance of growing as a person and an artist, while being close to some people who also care about me.

"I am a compassionate human being."

Amazing

- Walked at UP to buy yogurt. Saw the cats and the kapok tree's cotton flying in the air.
- Fun fruit salad conversation with Rem who expressed some of his inner processes.
- Learned a lot about investing: itâ€™s better to invest in the world market, golden butterfly portfolio.
