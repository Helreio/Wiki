## Review
### Studies

I journaled about how Hunger Games is a liberal democracy propaganda novel and film. I also wrote about which comes first, amoralism or anarchy? Finally, I wrote a few notes on anarchy and resolving differences through private property.

Wrote the following notes:
- [[Excessive publishing turns writing into product rather than process-based]]
- [[Action is driven by a preference or value]]
- [[The Philippines lack a mass intellegentsia]]
- [[vignettes/a morning walk at a fishpond in sta. teresa]]
- [[vignettes/a walk around the town of lopez quezon]]
- [[in search of the internment camp in los ba√±os]]
- [[vignettes/an afternoon at binhi]]
- [[The sentinels of Makiling]]
