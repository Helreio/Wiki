## I am grateful for:
1. Julius for agreeing to visit the cats while I am not there.
2. DIY MFA for providing me with a roadmap I will follow in the coming months.
3. The rain yesterday for making everything cool right now.

## Affirmation

I am a nature writer.

## Review
### Studies

I journaled a narrative about the difficulties of living a writing life in the Philippines in the rural areas especially when doing so publicly.

### Projects

[[projects someday/career planning]]

I continued to improve my reading list.
I read [[Sick of Nature - Gessner]] and got an idea on what to look out for in the nature writing genre. According to Gessner, the nature writing genre could be too spiritual. It has lost a pursuit of quest that is apparent in [[thoughts/walden by thoreau]].

By Gessner's recommendation, I started reading [[desert solitaire â€” abbey]], about three chapters. I like its down to earth nature. The books is also a collection of vignettes that come together into a narrative story. It gave me an idea on how possibly to organize a book. That said, I haven't gone far from the book to know if it is really philosophically good.

I started writing a note on the genre of [[Nature writing]].

### Others

- Rode my bike to Botao, then Botao-Carusocan Road, then went to my favorite trail at Matic-Matic.
- Continued watching Ozark.
