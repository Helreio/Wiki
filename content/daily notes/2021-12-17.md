I am grateful for:

1. My slow, insight-generating, perspective-changing walk at Pili Drive yesterday.
2. Lea standing up for me on her mother.
3. The joy that reading and processing APOW has brought to me the past days.

"I take things easy. Try and look for feedback."

Amazing

- Continued reading and processing APOW.
- Continued watching HIMYM.
- Decided to walk to Alligator Lake.
