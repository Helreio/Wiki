## I am grateful for:
1. Having Rem around.
2. Rem and my walk at UP last night.
3. The conversations and the holding of spaces.

## Affirmation

"I remember the things that are important to me."

## Field notes

## Review
### Studies

I journaled about what I learned from conversing with Rem. I also wrote about the need to listen to people with different beliefs, and how the writing life is simply listening and conversing.

I finalized Uman April 2022 and published it in the blog and in the newsletter.
