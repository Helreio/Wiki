I am grateful for:

1. Being able to stand instead of sit the entire morning yesterday. I did it, I can do it again.
2. Being able to walk yesterday even with a bad weather.
3. 100r and the creative challenge.

"I am patient. I will take things slowly and make progress on the things important to me."
