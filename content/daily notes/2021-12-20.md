# 2021.12.20

I am grateful for:

1. My first weed experience lol
2. Being able to manage my OCD by myself to the point that it is no longer debilitating.
3. Being alive today.

"I will understand myself more."

# Review

## Studies

- I journaled about my projects for 2022, converting the website into a wiki, and a strategy of sharing.
- I used index cards to make sense of the order of my projects.
- I started updating my life goals: created separate notes for goals per year then created a new note for 2022 goals. I also created a note for unsure and long-term goals.
- I relistened to Devine's interview at Future of Coding.
- I started modifying my daily routine to include daily reviews.
- I continued reading and taking notes in the article on transitioning to opensource: [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.makeuseof.com/tag/guide-living-free-open-source-life/amp/](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.makeuseof.com/tag/guide-living-free-open-source-life/amp/)
- I updated the note on conducting daily reviews: [[My daily review routine]]

## Projects

- I updated the website to contain only links to my previous works and indicate that it is in transition.

## Others

- Lea and I had lunch and merienda at the cafe at Vega. She had tuyo in oil and I had chicken and okra sisig. Both of us had the magestic omelet. Lea also bought a blueberry cheesecake we shared.
- I motivated Lea to pay off her credit card debt once and for all.
- I walked at Pili Drive.

# Fieldnotes

What is the mission?

- To come up with a personal philosophy of living

What is the philosophy? (Rules)

Backstory?

We don't know how to live because we lack models. We don't share.

(If you are not ready to publish a page, no need. Do sharing cautiously, slowly, iteratively)
