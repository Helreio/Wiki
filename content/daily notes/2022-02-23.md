## I am grateful for:
1. This calming spot.
2. The realization that I need to pause once more to see if Deep Philosophy is for me. The content is promising but I need to modify it once more to fit my needs.
3. Finding that long path, which I will walk at when I get the time.

## Affirmation

"I am a philosopher who contemplates."

## Review

### Studies

I journaled about my thoughts with Ran Lahav’s deep philosophy which was heavier in empirical knowledge than rational knowledge. This convinced me that I have to really understand this rational and empirical problem to really know if both forms of knowledge are equally weighty or if one validates the other. Also, it will tell me how to incorporate contemplation into my philosophical practice—what its real role to my life work is as a thinker.

I read and took notes on rationalism vs. empiricism: [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/)

### Others

Went back to working at Scribendi but had very few orders.
