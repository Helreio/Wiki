## I am grateful for:
1. Being here now, spending my time with Lea, working on what really matters.
2. Finally getting my Pag-ibig MID number.
3. This journey of getting to know who I am and what I ultimately want to do.

## Affirmation

"My relationship with Lea is my most important relationship right now."

## Review
### Studies



### Projects

**My Writing Life Project**

I journaled about what I learned about POV from DIY MFA. I also thought about how I can further bridge the gap between writing and living.

I continued reading DIY MFA, particularly the chapter on dialogue. I learned about tags and stage directions, which were new to me. I didn't know about stage directions and didn't know that tags is a thing in writing. I learned that dialogue in literary writing should be concise and shouldn't include ummmm, hmmmm, errr, which are typical of spoken language.

### Others

- I helped Lea do her second monthly financial review.
- I watched Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2.
- I watched the final episode of Sex Education Season 2.
- I performed my own monthly financial review.
