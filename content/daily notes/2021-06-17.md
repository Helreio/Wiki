## I am grateful for:
1. Being challenged once again to step up my creative game, to do the important work that has to be done.
2. Feeling a lot better. I am now able to shift my attention from the problem to the existing projects that I was distracted from.
3. Having all these projects on my plate, as of being entrusted these talents. No one will do them, and so I will.

## Affirmation

"I am entrusted with these talents. I will take good care of them."
