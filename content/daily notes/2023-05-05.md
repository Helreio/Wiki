## I am grateful for:
1. The more than one month of Maui's exhibit, which will be remembered more perhaps because of the Ilihan workshops.
2. The wonderful poems read yesterday.
3. Home

## Affirmation

"I will find my well and go back to it and there I shall find the strength and confidence I am looking for."
