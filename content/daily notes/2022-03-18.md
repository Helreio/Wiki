I am grateful for:

1. About 5 days of stay with my family here in Sta. Barbara. Just being around them.
2. Learning that I have a healthy personality and I am blessed with qualities that make me good with cognitive exploration.
3. The opportunity to see my family in Baguio again tomorrow.

"I am a natural cognitive explorer."
