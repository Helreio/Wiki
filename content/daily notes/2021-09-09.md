I am grateful for:

1. This moment with Chikako. Looking at the fields while writing my journal and a cute dog beside me while I am also taking a binaural video.
2. CBT. It will help me correct these automatic thoughts that color my judgement.
3. The wonder that is the platonic realm.

"I think healthier thoughts. I know I judge people fast, but I could pause and rethink my judgements."

Amazing

- Journaled about what I am feeling about Rem.
- Improved my index.
- Learned more about structure notes.
- Created a structure note for zettelkasten.
- Rode my bike to Botao then irrigation road.
- Watched Money Heist.
