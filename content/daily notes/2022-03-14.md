## Studies

I journaled about the goals of my life work, particularly looking for models of studying outside academia. I even wrote a draft email to send to key individuals who might be able to give me leads of Filipinos who are doing intellectual work outside academia.

I created a new project, “Philosophy Outside Academia,” to capture resources about this project. I then started re-reading the “Don’t Go Back to School” chapter on Benjamen Walker, the radio host who taught himself philosophy. My most important takeaway from Walker is that grad school has a very specific way of learning that accomodates a very specific person—that person is ideally a specialist who focuses on a single subject. The more generalist and adventurous will be judged as not good enough. I also learned from him that it is possible to learn a subject matter competently, and even be better outside academia, on your own. I also learned how public production and conversation can be very important in a philosophical career, and as a way to learn philosophy independently.

I also read the Introduction of the book, which featured Kio Stark’s own experience on dropping out of grad school. She dropped out because the method of learning didn’t work for her and was boring. I also read the Resources section of the book.

After this, I reviewed Steve Patterson’s career. I re-read an article that features an interview about his work ([https://medium.com/@zslayback/this-guy-says-you-don-t-need-a-phd-to-be-a-professional-philosopher-f03afd459ed](https://medium.com/@zslayback/this-guy-says-you-don-t-need-a-phd-to-be-a-professional-philosopher-f03afd459ed)). This was the most helpful among the three resources I consumed today about Steve's work. His workflow of reading—shower + thinking—writing dump—revising might be helpful to me.

I then watched his video on why he is not in academia ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzD-tjzXagM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzD-tjzXagM)). Finally, I listend to a podcast interview with him ([https://www.goingdeepwithaaron.com/podcast/77-steve-patterson-freelance-philosopher-running-from-academia](https://www.goingdeepwithaaron.com/podcast/77-steve-patterson-freelance-philosopher-running-from-academia)).

In the afternoon, I took a long walk and made a few realizations.

- If I subscribe to the error theory in thinking about my life purpose, then I could choose any purpose now and change it anytime. My minimum viable purpose now will be self-actualization and transendence. I will conduct a research whether this is a worthy goal. I then listed projects under it.
- I also wrote a work strategy worthy of consideration, which involves me conducting small personal development projects and documenting those.

## Projects

## Others

- I discovered a new trail along Matic-Matic to Maronong Road. It was a silent trail for about half of it. Then the other half was occuppied by houses.
- I started watching Narcos.
- I had a very meaningful conversation with Lea about areas where we think we are underappreciated.
