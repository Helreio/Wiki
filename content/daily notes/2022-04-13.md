I am grateful for:

1. Revisiting Austin Kleon's work and getting some much needed motivation and inspiration.
2. Sara's very generous treat.
3. My conversation with Lea last night.

"I can incorporate play in my work."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about what I want to bring into the world: beautiful non-fiction books that combine narrative, philosophy, culture, and history. This was me finally committing to what I want to give the world—the best way I think I can self-actualize and transcend.

I elaborated on how I could create intermediate packets and turn them into blog posts, newsletter, and books. I also wrote what needs to happen daily, weekly, and monthly for this to work.

I started a list of books that combine travel and philosophy.
