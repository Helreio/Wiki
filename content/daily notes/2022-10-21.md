## I am grateful for:
1. Walking in the early morning along Binloc beach a while ago, watching those waves, seeing those images and taking them.
2. Playing with Lea with the waves a while ago.
3. Having a good time with my family while eating at B&B.

## Affirmation

"I will make needed adjustments to improve my daily philosophical and contemplative practice, to be closer to Nature, and to carve out as much solitude and listening to myself as possible."
