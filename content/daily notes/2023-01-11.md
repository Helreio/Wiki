## I am grateful for:
1. The opportunity to establish a more stable source of income.
2. The holiday season that has passed, bringing people together, families stronger, and leaving a saunterer like me with lesser people around during my walks.
3. All the large trees that have fallen down. For the lives they have lived and for the new lives they bring forth into the world.

## Affirmation

"I am a tree. In this short life of mine, I bring forth more life."

## Review

In my journal, I drew a sketch of Ka-Icktoy.

I wrote the note: [[poems/sampung tanaga para kay jv]].

I read Craig Mod's brillian piece [Archetypes Revisited](https://craigmod.com/roden/075/).

I started watching a Skillshare course on proofreading by one Nitay.

While having lunch, Lea and I continued watching Russian Doll.

After lunch, I continued studying Nitay's course and did so even while eating merienda.

After merienda, I took the Proofreading Pal timed test and sent it.

After taking the test, Lea and I walked towards Pili Drive. There, we  clarified how much she is going to pay me to help her fix her systems.

Back at home, I prepared a salad dinner for the both of us. I ate dinner while watching the last episode of Katla.

After dinner, I went through my friends list and unfriended some.

While washing the dishes, I listened to the first episode of On Margins. Craig Mod talked with Jan Chipchase.
