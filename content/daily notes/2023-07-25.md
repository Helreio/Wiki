## I am grateful for:
1. Yesterday. It was a day with almost everything I need. After days (weeks?) of feeling like I don't have a lot, I finally have Lea, saw my friends, did good work, eat good food, walked, read a good book, experience the world, see my family, and had a good sleep. It's weird that I was feeling weird the entire day yesterday. I will use the energy today.
2. Feeling needed by my friends in an exciting way.
3. Seeing that the kitten despite its condition was around a clowder.

## Affirmation
