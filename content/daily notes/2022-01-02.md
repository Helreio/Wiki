I am grateful for:

1. The first day of the year.
2. Seeing that mama is okay.
3. These beautiful dancing leaves.

"I am blessed."

# Review

## Studies

I read and highlighted APOW Chapter 12 (Energy). I also continued processing my highlights on Chapter 11, which was about Thoreau. I wrote notes on how Thoreau’s economics is similar to the YMOYL idea that money = life energy. I also wrote a note about the difference between profit and benefit and how the things that we can’t outsource are the things we need to spend more time on. I also wrote about how wealth and poverty is a similar game (material accumulation) and that conscious frugality attempts to get out of this game.

After processing two diary entries, I started doing my monthly review using my updated monthly review. At the end I aggregated a report and revised it for its public version. Since the October monthly report was missing, I repeated that too.

## Projects

### Design vinceimbat.com

I watched a video from Flux about why we shouldn’t start in a UI for code website development platform like Webflow in designing a site ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AImZD4nLytw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AImZD4nLytw)). It basically advocates that we separate design from development, because design needs to be as open as possible. We try out different things. When we are in development mode, it is best when we focus on just getting the design as accurate as possible.

I also watched the lesson on how to edit photos ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbQxX7v_dfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbQxX7v_dfo)).

### Develop vinceimbat.com

While walking, I realized that I will have to learn a lot about design before really being able to get to the site I want. But I can’t wait a long time for that. I need to launch a MV website as soon as possible, which has basic functions but non-optimal design. This led me to decide to prioritize finalizing a basic content plan, getting my content from Wordpress and migrating that to a Jamstack site via Hugo and Netlify. By the end of January, I need to be able to have a place to publish and a workflow. When that has been established, that’s the right time to learn design.
