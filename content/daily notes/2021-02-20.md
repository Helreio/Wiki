I am grateful for:

1. Experiencing the hospitality of Aina personnels yesterday. I like how they treat walk-in customers.
2. Starting to drop weight again after going back to a low-sugar diet.
3. This day. The last day of my freedom for a while.

To do

- [x] Start reading "How I cured my silent reflux”.
- [ ] Start writing the second piece of my depression story.
- [x] Send email to Amazon to ask for a kindle unlimited refund.

“I will be unapologetically me.”

Amazing

- Had lunch with Lea at Satya Graha.
- Finished reading “How I cured my silent reflux”.
- My Kindle Unlimited refund was accepted.
- Walked with Lea.
- Cooked stir-fried mungo sprouts, cabbage, carrots, banana flowers, salt, and cumin.
- Tasted the no preservative wheat bread and the roasted peanut butter. Yummy!

Tomorrow

- Start working in Scribendi.
- If Scribendi work is not available, start looking for alternative sources of income.
