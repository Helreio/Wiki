I am grateful for:

1. The courage to reply to Tita Bebot that I am happy with my life right now.
2. Finally being able to go to the nearest BPI branch to solve the credit card problem.
3. This new day that was given me.

"Today, I will choose growth."

## Studies

I journaled about facing my fears. I focused on thinking about my fear of talking to someone at a video call.

I started revisiting my highlights with Transcend and bolding them.

In the afternoon, I felt like I needed a break so I went back to Austin Kleon’s work. I first listened to his interview at the Couragemakers ([https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lISbB1RoW52iKV784t0Fq?si=946dad19dc0b426e](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lISbB1RoW52iKV784t0Fq?si=946dad19dc0b426e)) then I also started listening to his interview at Art2Life ([https://open.spotify.com/episode/6lBt3BtPhfv20wAsJMc1Qr?si=28a15c6507df4fc6](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6lBt3BtPhfv20wAsJMc1Qr?si=28a15c6507df4fc6)).

I also went and read his newsletter last Sept 24, 2021 ([https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/10-good-books-i-read-this-summer?s=r](https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/10-good-books-i-read-this-summer?s=r)). Through this newsletter, I discovered the book "Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals" which I will definitely read. I also discovered new films to watch: The Cure and The Tragedy of Macbeth. I also started listening the soundtrack for Sexeducation.

The most important piece of writing I read through him is perhaps “Don’t be afraid to disappear” ([https://austinkleon.com/2021/09/20/dont-be-afraid-to-disappear](https://austinkleon.com/2021/09/20/dont-be-afraid-to-disappear/))

## Projects

## Others

- I called an electric fan repair man to repair my desk fan. I paid P250 (P40 tip) and had a good conversation to him about how he learned his skill, how to take care of fans, and bike robberies. There are really still a lot of good people out in the world.
- I finished watching Narcos Season 3.
- I continued watching Master of None.
- I sent my Tuloy-Daloy blackout poems to the Google Drive.
