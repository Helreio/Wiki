- I started playing around YNAB and trying to see whether I could organize our three budgets in it. I realized we couldn't. And I also saw how it could be pricy in the long-term, so I looked for alternatives.
- I discovered a tutorial on [applying YNAB using Google Sheets](https://michaelsaves.com/budgeting/ynab-budgeting-method-free-google-sheets/).
- I also saw someone create a [YNAB in Notion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/u2gphk/i_recreated_my_ynab_in_notion/)
- I then watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMO9UeeZ3Qc) that compared YNAB with Mint.
- All available options didn't work out well with me. One big hurdle was that I don't think I was completely ready to give up my current financial system which helps me review my finances monthly and track my savings and investments.
- So I ended up exploring how I can use Dollarbird with YNAB. I realized Lea and I can both continue tracking our personal expenses, while I add tracking our couple fund expenses. In the Dollarbird app, category limits exist which is great for budgeting. Meanwhile, I would update our budget via Google Sheets.
- I explored a few resources on semi-retirement. I read [The Ultimate Guide to Semi-Retirement](https://www.moneyflamingo.com/semi-retirement/). I also listened to a podcast episode, which mentioned the same semi-retirement FIRE alternatives mentioned in the article. I discovered that there is a name to the strategy I am living, which is the part-time FI strategy. I tried using two calculators to check how far off I am from FI. With my current rate of savings and my investments yielding a conservative 4% yield, I will retire in my 60s, which is  a bad proposition. This made me realize that I should maintain low expenses while increasing my income.
- All of this thinking reminded me of why it is important for me to find a passion business that would allow me to earn more but is more enjoyable and that I would love to do it longer. It also reminded me to find a second source of income and more, ideally, passive.
- I checked the performance of my ETFs just to convince myself to hold on.
