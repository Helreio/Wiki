I am grateful for:

1. The parts of my upgrade arriving. Now I can move on with this exciting experiment.
2. All the hope that these responses from the Pinoy Stoics group are providing me. There is a way for me to connect with my ideal audience. And they exist.
3. Gian for possibly opening a channel for me to talk about my skepticism of Covid in general.

"I have people like me and I have the power to engage with them and spend more time with them and serve them."
