Amazing

- I continued writing Lilim 007.
- I bonded with Lea and her siblings. Tasted a really delicious pizza.
- I found Spex Appeal and got free advice on how to move forward with the iphone issue.
- I felt blue and anxious. I am going through a stoic test right now.
- I learned from eToro that I am a few dollars away from being a Silver member.
- Talked with Lea about lots of stuff related to the iPhone issue: like things to be grateful for despite monetary losses and how we should react to one or prepare for one.
