I am grateful for:

1. My fever being gone.
2. Being able to confront Lea last night.
3. This new day to heal myself.

"I will achieve apatheia."

Amazing

- I continued to watch Mr. Robot.
- I was able to process my diary.
- Ate Tomyum from Likhaya.
- Some food arrived from Diwa. Yay!
- Ate dinner with Lea at Mint + Snow. The best!
