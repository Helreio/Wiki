I am grateful for:

1. Finally able to install a curtain on my office. I could start sleeping here as there will be less fleas here. Next thing that hopefully arrives soon is my chair.
2. Meeting Lea's friends and getting a handle on their dynamics.
3. Just being back home. I know I still have a fleas problem to solve but at least I can have some time for myself to do my most important work.

"I am comfortable in my own skin."
