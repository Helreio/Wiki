I am grateful for:

1. Being able to ride that genesis bus yesterday at the first available ride as a chance passenger.
2. Seeing Lea, going on a date with her, and just helping her think clearer about her career trajectory.
3. Learning patience and facilitation in dealing with Lea.

"I am patient."
