## I am grateful for:
1. The mentors that the universe has provided me. People who not only cheer me on but tell me exactly what I need to hear.
2. The ability to pause, contemplate, and develop wisdom.
3. Just being alive and experiencing all of these.

## Affirmation

"I am wise."

## Review

Walked Lea to Grove then bought some groceries and food.

Re-read my manuscript at ANWW20 pdf to check on layout and mistakes.

Sweet Tooth at lunch.

Tried migrating Pathfinders Commune to the Tungko Bluehost account but realized basic plan does not include add-on domains.

Worked on Candent marketing strategy. Created individual parts of the strategy in Google Docs. Learned how to do a SWOT analysis.

Underlords

Walked at Ela–Rambutan–Pili and followed a family with dogs. Wrote the poem [[poems/fog]]. Continued walking to Freedom Park and started reading Tokyo3 but stopped as mosquitos were biting me.

Sweet Tooth at dinner.

Underlords

Washed dishes while listening to some podcast then switching to listening to [Laura Dassow Walls' lecture on Barry Lopes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PDcxOdx0tU&t=1480s).
