3. The peace we are currently enjoying in the Philippines.

## Affirmation

"This day, I will be a step further into my journey."

## Review

I spent a long journaling session writing about how I can combine my areas of responsibility with my five categories of action in my life work. I came up with six new areas of responsibility. I also wrote about the steps one can take to strengthen these areas slowly using the metaphor of the walk. And then I wrote about the similarities of the metaphor of the well and the metaphor of walking.

I added the following notes:
- [[we feel belongingness to people we share metaphysical and epistemological beliefs with]]
- [[poems/ang maglakad mag-isa]]

I responded to Claire about her questions regarding the use of antidepressants and sleeping pills.

I continued watching Peaky Blinders.

I continued writing the minutes of Tuloy Daloy's first meeting.

I walked to Pili Drive.

I bought ingredients for lunch (Sinigang na Salmon Head) and chatted with the Ate Nancy gang regarding prices and children.

I had dinner by myself, eating maki while watching the season 4 finale of Peaky Blinders.

I walked to Agapita to fetch Lea, and we walked back home together.

I sent the minutes to Tungkomunidad.
