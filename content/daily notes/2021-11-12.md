I am grateful for:

1. Lea's safe arrival to Calamba.
2. This beautiful Friday morning.
3. My breakfast conversation with Papa and Bernice.

"I am a humble and devoted student of life."

Amazing

- I journaled with Chikako in front of the alog and flowed.
- I continued pruning my talahardin.
- I started watching Emily's masterclass on sex and communication.
- I walked and rode my bike in Irrigation Road.
- I continued watching Rorouni Kenshin.
