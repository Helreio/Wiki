## Review

Papa and I walked at Matic-Matic. We had a really good conversation. I felt my father wanted to catch up.
When me and Papa arrived, Lea and I had breakfast with my family: tinolang manok.
I meditated and journaled about the previous day.
Saw Kuya Dennis, Ate Ivy, Balong, and Ishmael.
Papa brought me and Lea at Tuliao where we waited for a jeep to bring us to Dagupan.
Had lunch at Silantro.
Bought some food and necessities at Nepo.
Checked in at Soulful Bliss.
Lea and I had a siesta at the beach front.
We had merienda at the beach front.
Lea and I journaled using the prompt "Dryspell/Tagtuyot" then we read each other's essays.
We then had a walk at the beach.
Bought some food for dinner.
Had dinner.
Watched House of the Dragon.
