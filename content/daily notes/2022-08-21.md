## I am grateful for:
1. The tasty vietnamese spring rolls last night.
2. Tantan's sweetness.
3. Being alive.

## Affirmation
"I am living a beautiful life."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about why buiding a philosophical life is similar to building a writing life. Both involve tending with one's writing, reading, and community. I journaled ideas for my [[projects someday/community]] project.

Created the following notes:
- [[Religion and spirituality sometimes teach that feeling bad is something good]]

I finished reading [[Gabriel Marcel]]'s introduction to [[thoughts/the inward morning by bugbee]]. I discovered that Marcel also has a journal, the metaphysical journal.

### Writing

I transferred the vignette on [[vignettes/the ube halaya stores at san pablo]] from my diary to my forest garden.

### Photography

Wrote a note on [[Sean Tucker]]

### Walking

I walked to Robinson's, picked up the laundry, and walked to UP just to accomplish my 10,000 steps.

### Projects

[[projects someday/community]]
- I checked [[Patrons in pursuit]] and listed potential people I can connect with.

Health insurance

### Others

- Watched 22 Jump Street.
