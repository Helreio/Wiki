Amazing

- Started organizing highlights into clusters in How to take smart notes.
- Moved in at my new house. Met Kuya Randy and Lou Ann. Our meeting was okay.
- Saw friends at Likhaya.
- Talked with Marky while eating at Ensalada.
- Talked to Lea again and tried to help her make sense of whatever sheâ€™s going through.
- Angel, owner of Satya Graha, reached out to me to ask Ate Mona to report tomorrow for an interview. It feels really good to make this happen. I am able to help Ate Mona then I am able to connect with the owner of Satya.

Tomorrow
