I am grateful for:

1. Realizing my psychological weaknesses - how much inner work I have to do.
2. My mama, who made lots of sacrifices and showed love for me over the years. I will show up now and help her out.
3. Yesterday's time with my soulmate and her family. It lifted up my spirits.

"I will settle things within me and then I will be a better person for my loved ones and people at large."

Amazing

- I journaled about my projects for November.
- I started reading zettelkasten advice from Zettelkasten.de and taking notes.
- I finished watching Mudbound.
- I did a monthly financial review.
- I talked to Lea even more deeply about ou sexualities.
