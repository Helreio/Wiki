## I am grateful for:
1. Meeting Tita Sabel for the first time as a conscious adult.
2. Walking with my parents yesterday and having a conversation we wouldn't otherwise have. It definitely is solved by walking.
3. Spending some time with Tita Loida, Tito Larry, Badette, and Denden. With Kobe, the dogs, and cats.

## Affirmation

"I am never alone in this life."
