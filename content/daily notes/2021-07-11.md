I am grateful for:

1. Meeting new people and friends yesterday.
2. Tasting Takoyaki and mushroom bulgogi.
3. Being able to pull some humor yesterday.

"I am funny. I am a good and even essential contributor to any gathering."

Amazing

- Met Care and experienced essential oils healing.
- Celebrated Ju's birthday.
- Experienced a clearing ritual for the first time.
- Published Lilim 11 and discovered that this was the kind of essay I enjoy writing: personal story plus reaearch plus take away insight.
