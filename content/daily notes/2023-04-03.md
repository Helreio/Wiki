## Review

I read "Si Donya Lina" in May Nagsabi sa Akin.

I handwrote [[Isang Tahanang Tatawagin Nating “Bukas”]].

Watched The Kominsky Method and Slam Dunk at lunch.

Started Weekly Review.

Chatted with Bevs about her performance at the gig.

Walked at Ela—Pili—Madamba—Viado. While walking I had insights about how to conduct the walking workshop.

Watched John Wick 2 at dinner.

Reconciled funds.
