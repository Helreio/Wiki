## I am grateful for:

1. Arriving at an overarching principle for my choice of life plan: Creativity and spirituality.
2. Yesterday's conversations with Lea about our odyssey plans. They have expanded what is possible and provided me with lots of ideas.
3. Being alive today and having rested, ready to continue thinking about the future.

## Affirmation

"I am a spiritual creative."

## Review

I journaled about the two main themes of activities I flowed into throughout my past: creativity and spirituality. I remembered the I Ching reading I had that told me to talk to "great men." I know that I need to start conversations with people, but now it has become clear to me that those "great men" are the religious and spiritual giants available around me to talk. I drew a sketch for my odyssey plan of this creative-spiritual life. Then I consulted the I Ching for the question, "What kind of day job should I look for to support my spiritual and creative life?"

Lea and I watched the season finale of Ancient Apocalypse while eating tinolang manok for lunch.

I wrote, edited, and published [[tlw/007]].

I walked to Data—Sierra Madre Ext.—Sierra Madre—Onyx—Ruby—Velasco—Aglibut—Sandoval—Narra—Gapud—Kanluran—Doña Aurora—Heliconia—Juliano—Royal Palm—Lopez—Santos.

After dinner, I finished TLW 7, and washed the dishes. Then, Lea and I watched I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore.
