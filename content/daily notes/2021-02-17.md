I am grateful for:

1. Finding Ona Sapiel and his Ethical Juan Podcast. I'll connect and try to start a conversation.
2. Stoicism, for not only teaching me how to manage my emotions but also connecting me with people like me.
3. That walk with Lea yesterday. It felt really good, to just be present with her.
