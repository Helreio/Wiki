## I am grateful for:
1. Being able to be present while around family last night even when it was awkward for a while.
2. This opportunity to commune with myself and write this week's newsletter.
3. Seeing Lea with the cats.

## Affirmation

"Writing this week's newsletter shall be a fulfilling experience."

## Review

I journaled about what I saw while walking at Matic-Matic-Maronong Road, [[poems/what I have]], processing some higlights from Living Philosophy, [[Experience first explain later]], [[Historical explanation precedes experience]].

Wrote, edited, and published The Long Walk 3.

Walked to Matic-Matic-Botao Road under flashes of lightning and thunder.

Watched Peaky Blinders.

Learned that Rem died.
