I am grateful for:

1. Finally able to get all my things from Sta. Maria.
2. My conversation last night with Lea about money.
3. My progress with training Nics to be a better editor.

"I am in a much better place in my life."

Amazing

- Got inspired to build my minimalist workstation after watching the video in YouTube.
- I went to Robinson's Calasiao to buy a couple of things in the grocery and hopefully to visit Booksale. But it closed already.
- Went to SM Dagupan and bought a dumb phone - a P1 cherrymobile. I missed having one of these.
- Had a haircut for P50 at a cheap barber's place.
- Saw FI ES AR and wrote a post.
- Went to Malimgas to buy boneless and puto.
- Had some street food in front of CSI.
- Wrote journal late in the afternoon.
- Had a bike ride then walk late afternoon and early evening. The moon was shining brightly during my walk.
