I am grateful for:

1. Finding out about Dr. Levy. I now have a resource to check further out.
2. My 1.5-hour convo with Lea last night. They are always exciting and fruitful even after 2 years.
3. The opportunity to work with the script writer again. Feeling excited.

"I desire inner peace."

Amazing

- Finished editing another script. It was fun.
- Continued watching Mr. Robot.
- Finished listening to Dr. Ley's interview.
