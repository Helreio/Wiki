I am grateful for:

1. A safe trip back to Pangasinan.
2. Getting Tita Remy's support: she even had Lea bring some pasalubong.
3. Just bringing Lea here in Pangasinan.

"I am loved."

Amazing

- Traveled with Lea to Pangasinan.
- Had lunch at Robinson's. Avocadoria is gone ðŸ¥².
- Rode jeeps to Bliss.
- Rode trike to Soulful Bliss.
- Met Ate Betty and checked in inside the hanging house.
- Took a bath in a bathtub! Our favorite part of the house!
- Went to Tondaligan to eat at Matutina's.
- Rode a trike back to Bliss but got lost so we looked for our own way.
- Chatted a bit with Ate Betty about our vaccine stands.
- Watched Yesterday with Lea over beer and chips. A great film.
