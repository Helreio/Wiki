I am grateful for:

1. Seeing that my family in Pangasinan are okay and that they are getting better with their health.
2. David Sedaris' work and inspiration.
3. My past thoughts and lessons learned.

"I am wise."

Amazing

- I journaled about the kind of writing I want to do.
- I published [[Lilim, 02(12) — What’s “Next” in Your Life?]].
- I continued processing Evernote notes.
- I went to Auntie Pearl's Pizza and ordered two 12" pizzas with free drink and pasta.
- Started reading The Art of Solitude by Stephen Batchelor. I was introduced to Montaigne's life: how he became a philosopher and essayist.
- Went to Calamba, finally met Tita Remy properly, and celebrated Tita Luz's birthday.
