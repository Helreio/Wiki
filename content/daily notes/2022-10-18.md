## Affirmation

"Today will be a meaningful walk."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about how I can make my mornings even better.

Started reading Logic and Voice by Hammer.

Started reading Tractatus.

Listened to:
- [Analytic vs. Continental Philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GjmJMkRCHY)
- [Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ33gAyhg2c)
- [Brian Leiter on the analytic/continental distinction](https://philosophybites.com/2011/12/brian-leiter-on-the-analyticcontinental-distinction.html)

### Writing

Tried translating Emily Dickinson's poem on exultation.

Reviewed my highlights on the foreword of [[Kapag Natagpuan Kita = Once I Find You â€” Rofel Brion]], added notes about Rofel Brion's writing style, Noelle de Jesus' translation process, and wrote [[Translation by collaboration]].

Transferred [[Kabuwasan]] and [[vignettes/dimla]] into my forest garden.
