I am grateful for:

1. This last day of an interesting month of April. My first hot summer month in LB.
2. Having a wonderful girlfriend who is slowly easing into spending some money for me.
3. Seeing the response of people to my writing about the beautiful cat I saw the other day.

“I am a consistent writer who will show up writing about what is important for him.”

Amazing

- I played around Mailchimp, Moosend, and Mailerlite to find a service I can use for now. I think I will settle for Mailerlite for a bit.
- I wrote [[2021-04-30 Yesterday, I…]]
- I walked to UP to buy yogurt and to walk.
- I tried different ways to administer Shorty's medicines. Mixing it with her food seems working.
- Wrote for 15 mins with Lea about comparison.
