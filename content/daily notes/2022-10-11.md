## I am grateful for:
1. Learning more about the life and works of Henry Bugbee.
2. Seeing that my dogs back in Pangasinan are doing all okay.
3. This room that has given me the silence I have always needed to work.

## Affirmation

"What matters most is how the philosophy is lived."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I continued reading The Inward Morning and wrote [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-09-28]]. Here Bugbee explains why he thinks believing to understand is problematic. 

Wrote the following notes:
- [[Benefits of navigating difficult conversations]]
- [[poems/kalsada haiku 1]]
- [[poems/how to live haiku]]

### Writing

### Photography

### Walking

I walked Velasco—Narra—Royal Palm—Freedom Park—Pancho—Viado—Juliano—Roxas—Pili—Rambutan—Ella

### Projects

**Reading inbox**
- I finished including Zotero meta data of books I read.
- I also deleted books I don't intend to read from my reading inbox.

### Others

- Lea and I watched House of the Dragon.
- Lea and I watched Athlete A.
