I am grateful for:

1. That article that Diwa sent. It not only started me thinking about my vocation, it also made me think about anarchy, methodological individualism and the discourse on colonialism.
2. Maui's invitation for cooking at Satya from 11-1 pm.
3. Being able to breath easier.

"I am a storyteller."

Amazing

- Received an invitation from Maui for an event at Satya on Saturday.
- Wrote about my thoughts about the article Diwa shared. I also posted a long reply to her post.
- Reviewed classical laws of logic and wrote permanent notes about them.
- Continued watching iPS.
- Listened to Ezra Klein's interview with Alison Gopnik about the intelligence of children.
- Canceled appointment with Ace Ark because of thunderstorm.
