I am grateful for:

1. Claire and Rem's treat at Spice Jar. Food is great. Atmosphere and ambiance is great. Wonderful conversation as usual.
2. Seeing a hawk yesterday. It is probably my first time to see one gliding. Or if ever I saw one, it was a long time ago, or I didn’t see it glide.
3. This place (as compared to Santa Maria). Yes there is noise but not so loud and disturbing. Yes there is smoke but very infrequent. And I am far from people I don’t want to see.
