I am grateful for:

1. Being able to express to Lea what I want in our relationship.
2. Having a girlfriend who is brave.
3. The time I have and the work I want to do.

"I will define my work for the coming days as clearly as possible."

Amazing

- I journaled about my understanding of the relationships among happiness, presence, and purpose.
- I translated [[Kaliskis na Ulap â€” Mga Salin#07-24-1852 Tingin nila bulakbol ako]].
- I read Lynn Tillman's essay "Blue shores".
- I finished my monthly review.
- Bought food etc. then walked around Agapita and Demarces.
- Continued watching Money Heist.
- Had a nice conversation with Lea about how we make choices in our life system.
