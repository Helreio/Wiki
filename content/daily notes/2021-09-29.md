## I am grateful for:
1. Being able to reflect on and articulate my feelings and thoughts about my sexuality.
2. Editing that very interesting screenplay.
3. Lea's assurance that I can be myself in this relationship, I can be the contemplative that I am. And she'll be okay with it.

## Affirmation

"I am adept at being at peace with my thoughts and emotions, briddling them if need be."

## Review

- I achieved my quota a day earlier.
- Edited two recommendation essays for a researcher and got inspired with the dedication to do research.
