## I am grateful for:
1. The wise, grounding, and firm words from Sir Rofel that drew me back to my roots, back to my home, back to my Ili.
2. Taks's specific advice about how to make comments.
3. How Maui handled opposite opinions for recommendations.

## Affirmation

"I am going back to my well."
