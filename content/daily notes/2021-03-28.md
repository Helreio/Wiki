I am grateful for:

1. Being able to stay calm yesterday while everyone was panicking. Being able to stay okay despite the guard pissing me off once again.
2. The good news that Lea got the job. I am sincerely happy and relieved. I hope this one works for her well.
3. This yummy okara pandesal I am eating right now.

“I’ll be okay despite the ECQ.”

Amazing

- I had fun with Lea the entire day.
- I walked to Grove with Lea to buy food and cat stuff.
- I watched “The 40-year-old Virgin” with Lea.
- I realized that the most important category of action in my work is [[thoughts/living]]. Because it is living itself.

Tomorrow
