## Review

Froi sent me a recording of Rem's answer to his question of why Tungko. He sent me the entire recording and a shorter recording. I listend to the shorter one.

Lea, Diwa, Marky, and I commuted by ourselves to the second eulogy. I invited Uwa and Abbey to perform a ritual for the eulogy on such a quick notice. They accepted. Lea and Diwa did their best to figure out how to setup the sound system. We started at around 7 pm.

I met Sir Ton Delgado and was amazed with how he applies tai chi with magic. He asked me to be his assistant in his magic trick.

Debs and Cris arrived.

While the eulogy is happening, I talked to Uwa and Abbey outside and thanked them for making it in such a short notice.

After the eulogy, I introduced myself to Czyka Tumaliuan and met her daughter So. I also talked to Gene.
