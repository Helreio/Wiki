## I am grateful for:
1. Lea's birthday. She is now 32 and I met her when she was just 28 years old.
2. Champy for showing more signs of being okay. I feel optimistic about her progress so far. Hopefully, it will be consistent.
3. The rest that I experienced yesterday in front of Freedom Park.

## Affirmation

"I will find a way to continuously connect to bliss despite challenges."

## Review

I read [Meemmberrrshhiippss! â€” Roden Newsletter Archive](https://craigmod.com/roden/078/).

I started my metalearning project for improving editing and proofreading by going through resources that Tara Whitaker recommends.
- I searched for APA and CMOS for sale at Book Depository.
- I browsed rates and courses at ACES. I also extracted ideas for my customized curriculum from their courses.
- I checked for all the book recommendations of Tara.
- I browsed rates and courses at EFA.

I reached out to Jen Gonzalve.

After Lea cooked Mac and Cheese, we got ourselves prepared and walked to Freedom Park via Grove to have a birthday picnic. We first went by Micha's Bakeshop. I bought myelf a Super Puff while Lea got herself two cupcakes.

At the picnic, we talked, ate, and played Sequence.

We went home to feed the cats and sleep.

After sleeping, I had merienda while I finished my monthly review and continued my metalearning for the editing and proofreading improvement project.

After this, I played Underlords.

Then I watched Lea do a quick live.

After this, I did some more walking at UP.

When I came home, Lea and I had dinner while watching A Bad Moms Christmas.

I washed the dishes after while listening to [a podcast episode from the Modern Editor Podcast](https://tarawhitaker.com/episode-22/).

I also listened to a few YouTube videos about how editors became editors:
- [How to Become an Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrriVbFPifs)
- [4 Types of Editing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CfhwWFxRGw)
- [How I Became an Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6DSbf13iio)

I went to sleep after.
