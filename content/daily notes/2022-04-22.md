## I am grateful for:
1. Learning about the connection between Annie Dillard and Thoreau and being excited about the prospect of understanding how they did their work and how I can create something similar.
2. Getting a free upgrade to a deluxe room.
3. The opportunity to go see Baguio this year for the third time.

## Affirmation
"I am a student of Thoreau."

**Obsidian migration**

I decided to pull the trigger and migrate my notes from Craft to Obsidian. I wanted to feel more autonomy and think better while looking at my notes.

I started by migrating all my daily notes. I also converted all my 5mj into daily notes. Through the Calendar plugin, I can jump to any past daily note similar to Craft. But since I converted the 5mj to daily notes, I can also jump to them through the calendar.

### Others

- Woke up early to ride Genesis to Tarlac then Baguio.
- Saw policemen outside the terminal. I thought they would find Genesis' undercover trip.
- We had a bit of comotion at Tarlac while transferring to the joybus. I managed my temper well.
- Lea and I had late lunch at 50's Diner.
- We checked in at Azalea, rested, and waited for Lea to finish working and doing a live while working on my Notes.
- We had dinner at what would be one of my favorite places to eat moving forward: Extremely Espresso Cafe.
- We walked back to Azalea and I gave Lea a scare by showing her the hunted hause.
