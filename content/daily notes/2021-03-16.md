I am grateful for:

1. The sun for returning.
2. These two consecutive early morning journaling sessions. This workspace is starting to do its magic. The quiet. The solitude. I am able to hear my voice again.
3. A good night sleep.

To do

- [ ] Finish weekly review.
- [x] Decide whether to commit to Learning Another Way.
- [x] Bring Shorty to the vet.

“I am a self-directed learner and facilitator.”

Amazing

- Experienced how hard it could be bringing a cat to the Vet.
- Experienced amazing service from UP Vet Hospital.
- Learned that Shorty has a bacterial infection underneath her skin and fungal infection over her.
- Finally got shorty vaccinated with anti-rabies and dewormed her.
- Got closer to Shorty.
- Bought other things Shorty needs, realized what it feels like to save someone from a really bad state into a better state.
- Committed to Learning Another Way.
