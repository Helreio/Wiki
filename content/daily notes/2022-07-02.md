# 2022-07-02

## I am grateful for:
1. My safe and relatively flawless travel yesterday.
2. Seeing my family once more and being okay with them and seeing they are all ok.
3. Meeting Lilo and sleeping with Kako last night.

## Affirmation

"What I want, I already know. I just have to listen to myself."

## Review
### Studies

### Writing

I wrote about my morning in my journal. I then wrote about how writing elevates the moment and why I may not be able to live according to Elizabeth Gilbert's admonition.

### Photography

### Projects

### Others

- Started doing my monthly review by writing my monthly report for June. It made me realize that I may have failed in finishing the projects and goals I set for this month, but I did a lot and learned a lot.
- Continued watching Pachinko.
