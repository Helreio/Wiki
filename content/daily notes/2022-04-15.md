## I am grateful for:
1. Lea's feedback that I sound like myself more when I speak in Filipino. This has convinced me to try writing in the language more. I've tried everything to find my voice and haven't had much success. It's time to try something different.
2. Allison Fallon for her advices in writing.
3. This new day.

## Affirmation

"Magaling akong magsulat sa Filipino."

## Review

### Other

- Watched Paddleton with Lea (5/5).
