# 2022.03.04

I am grateful for:

1. Mama's procedure finally happening later.
2. Being back to my comfort zone here in LB.
3. The fact that I am thinking more outwardly these days, which means I am more integrated in my relationships, which means I feel less alone.

"I will be able to give Lea a memorable birthday."
