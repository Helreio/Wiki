## I am grateful for:
1. That beautiful walk I did yesterday. I missed those kinds of walks.
2. The walk narrative I am starting to write.
3. Discovering that part of Pili and seeing the moon emerging out of the mountains.

## Affirmation

"I live a beautiful world, and I live a wonderful life."

## Review

I read a really interesting chapter on May Nagsabi sa Akin that used the second person: "Tayong Tatlo."

I spent around two hours just piecing together my walk yesteray at Maahas road.

I finished watching the season 5 finale of Cobra Kai.

I continued writing my proposal for Ili.

I accomplished other needed information for the Ili workshop.

I walked to Forestry.

I had dinner while watching Peaky Blinders.

I continued working on the Ili proposal. I learned the importance of including wireframes in the design process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktMFQpY78-I
