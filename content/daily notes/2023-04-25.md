## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing Dos and Tuldok yesterday. Hugging Dos like I was hugging Doji again.
2. Yesterday's successful morning writing session.
3. Figuring out how to make redirects in Hugo.

## Affirmation

"I am a good writer."

## Review

I spent less than an hour working on the new Ili pubmats.

I had lunch while watching Peaky Blinders.

Then Lea and I watched the first episode of Ted Lasso Season 3.

I started fixing the vinceimbat.com website.

I walked to Forestry.

I had dinner while working on the website.
- I learned how to change the font size correctly.

I sent a message to all potential participants to the walk.

I played Underlords.
