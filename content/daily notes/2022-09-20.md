## I am grateful for:
1. An interesting and productive consultation at KonsultaMD yesterday. I had what I needed from the comfort of my house.
2. An opportunity today to be with friends for fun.
3. Feeling better in terms of my headache.

## Affirmation

"I will make the most of the two hours I have."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about the many facets of the gift and how we can practice it today in a modern world.

Continued reading The Gift.

Wrote the following notes:
- [[Maximize focus to maximize effort]]
- [[Are habits fully unconscious?]]
- [[A gift strengthens an existing relationship]]
- [[The closer the bond between two people the less natural it is to commodify exchanges]]
- [[Academia can become exclusivist because it has a gift economy]]
- [[The komun is a gift practice]]
- [[Lewis Hyde]]

I started collecting ideas for the [[Gift workshop]]
