I am grateful for:

1. Finally handing over P4,200 to Tita Edna for my rent this month. This signals my commitment to this place, the beginning of settling down and focusing on my projects.
2. The wonderful time at Sunday Market yesterday. It feels so good to finally have these experiences and with the people I adore so much too.
3. The good people like Tita Edna, whose empathy towards other people can really be felt and seen. They are models for people like me for whom helping other people don’t always come natural.

To do:

- [x] Morning writing routine
- [x] Continue annual review
- [x] Buy household needs
- [ ] Do Weekly Review

“I am in a wonderful place.”
