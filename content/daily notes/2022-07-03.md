## I am grateful for:
1. My journaling session at the field yesterday. One I waited for two months to be able to do again.
2. My monthly review yesterday, especially writing the monthly report. It showed me objectively how much I have achieved in the past month.
3. The walk yesterday, which made me thought of a lot of things and clarified where I want to go especially in my life work and walking specifically.

## Affirmation
