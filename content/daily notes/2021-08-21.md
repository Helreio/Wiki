I am grateful for:

1. Lea for being around.
2. Learning more about how we can improve Kako's health.
3. Nobody (2021)

"I am able to identify who I want to follow and serve."

Amazing

- I journaled about my audience and rationalism.
- Translated [[Kaliskis na Ulap â€” Mga Salin#01-18-1860 Nakikiramdam sa mga kalooban ng kalikasan]].
- Finished researching about Kako's health and sending Mama preliminary instructions.
- Took Lea out for a date. Had the best takoyaki around.
- I did not eat bread after dinner.
- Continued watching Money Heist.
