I am grateful for:

1. Available Scribendi assignments I can accomplish to achieve my financial goals for this month.
2. The past 20+ days of exciting freedom: studying my field, fixing my diet, etc.
3. Rem’s advice and my decision to continue asserting myself in a respectful manner.

To do

- [x] Start Scribendi

“I can be assertive in a respectful manner.”

Amazing

- Realized I do want to do something else.
- Walked at UP. Too many police force.
- Rejected a very difficult task in Scribendi and was okay about it.
- Talked to Lea.
- Wrote [[vignettes/milk]].
