## Review

I started working on the Ilihan Workshops pubmats.

We had lunch while watching Beef.

I walked.

In the evening, I reviewed the Tribe video about conducting a [[Discovery call]] to prepare for another call with Benjie.

I also read about the difference between graphic design and web design.

I had a call with Benjie and Joji.
