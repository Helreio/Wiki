## I am grateful for:
1. Rem and Rein agreeing to look at my poems for publication. And for Rem for sending that 30-min critique video.
2. Getting clearer with what I want to do with my photography.
3. Mama's balatong and sapsap recipes.

## Affirmation

"I am going to enjoy this day and make it productive."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled to release and process my recent anger practice opportunities.

### Writing

I finished reading *Open City*'s chapter 1.

I listened to Rem's feedback on my poems and made some adjustments based on them.

### Photography

I created presets on developing photos in Lightroom Classic. I then started writing notes on my Talahardin detailing these developing processes.

I understood aspect ratio and pixel sizes because of a problem while developing a 1.91 x 1 photo with white border in LrC.

I watched Sean Tucker's feature on Dan Baker (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaHvSXRdp0s&t=124) and learned about how one's choice of place could determine one's visual voice.
