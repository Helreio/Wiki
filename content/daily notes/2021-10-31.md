I am grateful for:

1. Tita Remy for being nice to me.
2. Having a family in Calamba I can go to when I need to feel more connected.
3. My continuously deepening relationship with Lea.

"I am an honest and fair partner."

Amazing

- I journaled about my feelings regarding bypassing Lea's privacy. I also started reading for advice regarding it. My current conclusion is that I need to process this first by myself before telling it to her.
- I went to Sunday Market to buy pasalubong and food for the next days. I bought relyeno for myself and sourdough for Lea's family.
- I rode a tricycle to Lea's house with a young girl beside me. I went home with a young girl again. Were they the same father and daughter duo? No. But what a coincidence.
- I tasted Lea's brunch (fried rice, egg, and longganisa).
- I tasted Tita Remy's bilo-bilo.
- Lea and I watched "I'm Drunk, I Love You."
- Lea and I made tuna pie.
- Lea and I walked in Villa then went to the Food Park where we took pictures then bought fruit teas.
- Lea and I walked home and had dinner with Tita Remy and Jacob. I got to interview Tita Remy about how she fixed the problem with her land.
