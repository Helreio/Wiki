## I am grateful for:
1. The strength to go through all of these.
2. This coming together of thoughts and insights about religion and spirituality.
3. This moment.

## Affirmation

"I trust that Lea will finally be able to stand up for herself and set boundaries."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about how religion and spirituality are still very relevant to my life work especially after learning that my project has a religious nature to it. Using this new insight, I journaled about how I will go about cultivating the five areas of my life work.

### Writing

I transferred the following vignette to my forest garden: [[vignettes/the dirt roads are my kissas]].

### Photography

### Walking

Walked at Pili Drive and at the fields there.
