I am grateful for:

1. Another lovely day with Lea. I was just focused on making sure I took good care of her and paid attention to her needs.
2. Jack's bravery and articulate sharing of his journey.
3. September. A one hell of a month.

"I am capable of moving on from a mistake. I am resilient and can focus on getting better based on the mistake."
