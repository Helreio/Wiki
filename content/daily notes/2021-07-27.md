I am grateful for:

1. Stoicism once again for informing me what to do at these situations.
2. Doji for coming into my life and being part of nine years of it. That's about 1 third. He is the defining dog of my 20s. His death signal the end of my 20s and the beginning of an entirely new chapter of my life. I will forever miss him.
3. The stoic challenges that happened before this that prepared me for the emotions of this situation.

"I am resilient."

Amazing

- Continued working on Scribendi.
- Started watching Money Heist.
- Walked to bridge before Pili Drive at UP.
- Listened to some podcasts about pet loss grief.
- I cried after a misunderstanding with Lea triggered my grief emotions for Doji.
