## I am grateful for:
1. Reconnecting with my quest for purpose.
2. Understanding how purpose, vision, and mission interacts with each other.
3. This day and this morning that I could use for introspection.

## Affirmation

"I live a purposeful life."

## Review

I reviewed my purpose and revised it: [[thoughts/my purpose is to live deliberately]].

To do so, I read [To Live Deliberately: Thoreauâ€™s Philosophy Remains Relevant | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/meditation-modern-life/202011/live-deliberately-thoreau-s-philosophy-remains-relevant).

Lea arrived and we had lunch while watching TKM.

After lunch, we immediately prepared and traveled to San Pablo to attend Max's and Ria's birthday.

En route to San Pablo, I read recent chats on the Quartz Discord.

After the birthday party, Lea and I walked to SM San Pablo to see it. We had milk tea at Gong Cha.

Then we walked from SM San Pablo to the jeep terminal. It was a fun walk that involved a lot of pun jokes.

We bought some ube before riding the jeep home.

From LB junction, we walked again home. Lea had some refreshments at 7 eleven.

Back at home, I played Underlords and watched some NBA highlights to rest.

After taking a bath and before sleeping, I spent some time on my forest garden, tweaking [[My life plan]]. I transferred some notes to [[Unprocessed notes on creating]].
