## I am grateful for:
1. The joy of hearing disco and bossa nova music last night.
2. Walking Binmaley baywalk.
3. Being in a perya again for the second time after quite some time.

## Affirmation

"I will make progress in writing the essay."

## Review

I continued writing the essay for Academia Research.

Before 3 pm, I went at Kuya Nonong's house to meet Rainier and join the others for samngyupsal. We drove to Calasiao at Yugenee to have unli samgyupsal and shabu-shabu. The food was okay.

After the early dinner, I stayed a bit at Kuya Nonong's house but went back home early.

Back home, I did my weekly review.
