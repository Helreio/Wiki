## I am grateful for:
1. Last night's reminder that I should be more strategic with how I use my time. That belief means starting even if I am not yet ready.
2. Finishing a big chunk of the Ili website work yesterday.
3. Lea and Mama for listening to my admonition.

## Affirmation

"I am a writer."

## Review

Walked: Data–Ruby–Halcon (and back)

Journaled on my current work life. Checked [[private/2023 personal narrative vision|2023 personal narrative vision]] and see what still resonates with me and what needs adjustment.

Lunch + Criminal UK

Walked: Data–Ruby–Velasco–CEM–Capinpin–Aglibut–Royal Palm–Mondonedo–Argañosa (to go to El Circulo Cafe, but it was full and take-out only)

Went to Lotus Cafe instead by jeep. Not so good.

Journaled about my current work life situation.

Continued reading [[thoughts/overlap by sean mccabe|Overlap by Sean McCabe]].

Sat on a bench at Velasco with Lea before she left for Sacred Space.

Walked: Velasco–Narra–Juliano–Royal Palm–Lopez–Halcon–Ruby–Data

Dinner + Continued reading Overlap

Finished SEP 273.

Continued reading Overlap.
