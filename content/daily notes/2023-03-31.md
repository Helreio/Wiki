## I am grateful for:
1. The opportunity to hold my first walking workshop this coming month.
2. Positive feedback I got again on my photos.
3. Being trusted by Bevs.

## Affirmation

"I am a student of walking"

## Review

Continued working on [[Entry to ANWW20]].
- Formatted the paper into MLA.
- Accommplished the application form.

Watched the Kominsky Method at lunch.

Continued working on the entry.

In the evening, Lea and I ate at a carinderia outdoors then went straight to Jacques to attend Bevs' gig.

After the gig, I finalized the entry and sent it to Ateneo.

Then I worked on SEP 259.
