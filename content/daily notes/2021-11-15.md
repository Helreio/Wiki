I am grateful for:

1. Letting go of the old Macbook Air and giving it to Bernice officially. It is less ideal but I want to give back to my family and this is the least I can do.
2. Love. The things we do for our family, friends, and strangers.
3. Letting go of Masterclass.

"I am a loving brother."

Amazing

- Journaled at alog with Kako.
- Had an hour of training with Nics.
- Went to Sta. Maria and got all of my important things there. I won't have to consistently go there every time I go home.
