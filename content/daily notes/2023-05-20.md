## I am grateful for:
1. Having that hard conversation with Benjie about the contract.
2. Trusting Lea, willing to let go of ₱6500 for the sake of building a foundation for our partnership moving forward.
3. The incredible experience of walking in pitch black darkness in UP.

## Affirmation

"I have great friends."
