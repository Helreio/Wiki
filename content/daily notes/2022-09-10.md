## I am grateful for:
1. My really fun walk with Lea a while ago.
2. Coming to terms with the fact that it will be really good for me to establish other streams of income.
3. My sunlife insurance being approved.

## Affirmation

"I will build a financial life that supports the life that I want."

### Projects

[[ynab]]
- I helped Lea fixed her ideal budget.
- Then we budgeted her earnings from Sariah.
- I started thinking about ways for me to increase my income.
	- I started watching [Ali Abdaal's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5y69v1RbU0&t=1019s) about his different sources of income.
	- I listened to 25 ideas for passive income (The Personal Finance Podcast).
	- I listened to a podcast about how to decide whether a passion should be converted into a business or not (Career Change Podcast).
	- I also started watching Charm de Leon's [11 source of income](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRoGiho8fik&t=227s).
- Thinking about increasing my income led me to think about how all of these relate to what I want to do with my life.

### Others

- Lea and I watched Eat Pray Love.
