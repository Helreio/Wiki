## I am grateful for:
1. Lea for bathing Champy. I hope she feels better after that.
2. Realizing how much I need to do to optimize my subjective experience.
3. Exploring new trails yesterday.

## Affirmation

"I will feel more today."

## Review

- I journaled about my talahardin improvement and being more intentional in what I am feeling during journaling
- I started processing my project inbox for Talahardin and created a structure note
- I started Elaine Welteroth's masterclass
- Walked at the new path behind Balon Dalan while thinking about ideas from Elaine
- Started watching Bodyguard
- Shared to Lea Elaine's thoughts then we talked about spirituality. She listened to an interview with Sadghuru and we just became existential.
