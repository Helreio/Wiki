Amazing

- I finished answering the [[private/2020 Past & Coming Year Questions]].
- I ate oatmeal for lunch.
- I finished watching Patay na si Hesus.
- I slept for 1 hour.
- I walked at UP. I covered the left side. I walked past several dormitory, boarding house, and apartment compounds. Then I passed a bridge, a temporary settlement for laborers, then the path to IRRI. I walked vigorously for about an hour.
- I went to Centrro to buy wheat bread and garbage bags. I also bought food: tinolang manok and macaroons.
- I ate dinner while watching The Crown.
- I talked to Lea from 8-9 pm where we talked about how she could save for her emergency fund while assuring that she still have money to meet me weekly.
- I continued writing my PVN.
