I am grateful for:

1. The rain a while ago in the early morning. Perhaps the reason why the laborers are not coming today.
2. The soundscape last night when I stopped in the baseball field. I realized how much I miss my nature escapes in Pangasinan, how much I'm free to listen for as long as I want.
3. Ate Mau reaching out to me and telling me she misses me.

"I am a contemplative."

Amazing
