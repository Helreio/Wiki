I am grateful for:

1. Being with Lea and her family and having a good time with them.
2. Being able to make Tita Remy laugh.
3. The thought-provoking read of A Philosophy of Walking

"I am a walker."

Amazing

- Continued using Talahardin cycle to read and process APOW.
- Continued watching HIMYM.
- Vaccuumed the house once more.
- Walked at Pili Drive for the first time in a while. Applied what I learned from APOW.
- Saw Ome at Grove while he is in Tungkuan. Showed myself to the group and had a quick photo.
- Convo with Lea.
