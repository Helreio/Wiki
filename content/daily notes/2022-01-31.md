I am grateful for:

1. My recent interest on Thich Nhat Hanh. It is renewing my contemplative practice and life work.
2. This meditation practice that just culminated. Thank you.
3. Lea's family for welcoming me and making me feel that I am indeed part of the family.

"I am a contemplative."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about my life work based on my recent realizations on understanding and compassion.

I wrote a new note based on a journal entry about the uses of prioritization.

I finished reading APOW and processed Chapters 9, 13, 14, 15, and 16. I wrote notes about the following;

- Walking teaches compassion.
- Walking is a mindfulness practice.
- Walking could be a pilgrimage.
- Walking is an experiential introduction to emotions
- Cynics

I continued reading Thayâ€™s longer biography in the Plum Village website.

## Projects

## Others

I continued watching HIMYM.

I walked at Pili Drive and Freedom Park in the afternoon to evening.

I started watching Smaller and Smaller Circles.

I became the number 1 KO Underlords player in the world.
