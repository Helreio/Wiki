# 2022.01.03

I am grateful for:

1. The previous month of December - a month of discovery.
2. Surviving a second year of this pandemic madness, while still thriving.
3. This new day added to my life - relatively healthy - ready to take on the challenges of today.

"I am focused on the eternities."

# Review

## Studies

I continued processing my highlights in APOW Chapter 11 (Thoreau). I wrote a note on how to avoid exoticism when walking.

## Projects

### Annual Review

I did a daily review and weekly review at the same time as I was thinking about my monthly review and annual review.

I journaled an initial list of what I am grateful for.

I compiled my 2021 Annual Report.

I started writing a complete gratitude list for 2021.

## Others

Created and shared a canva Facebook post on a Thoreau quote that I translated: “Walang saysay ang pag-upo upang magsulat kung hindi ka pa tumatayo upang mabuhay.”

I watched this video from Alec Soth about his latest book A Pound of Pictures: ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVoCUEngsg&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyVoCUEngsg&t=1s)). His perspective of photography is really profound and these videos are motivating me to learn videography soon.

I was a little rattled by the stricter guidelines Covid policies in NCR particularly for the unvaccinated.

Walked to Lopez and bought ingredients for the sopas.

Watched On the Edge of Seventeen with Lea. Fun movie!

Had a dissociative experience.
