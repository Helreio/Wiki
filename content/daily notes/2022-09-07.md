## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing and being with my friends yesterday. It was a nice talk and opportunity to practice tolerance once more.
2. Learning that Lea was hired by Sariah.
3. Feeling that I am about to close another goal I have postponed for a long time already: getting insured.

## Affirmation

"I remember my original intention. I do not forget."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about how the goals I wrote in my Personal Narrative Vision are slowly coming true.

Wrote the notes
- [[Give yourself the freedom to change your mind]]
- [[Focus on systems not goals]]
- [[poems/say andukey ya akar]]
- [[Self-reliance influences our approach to insurance]]
- [[Not knowing spurs imagination]]

I continued reading the Inward Morning and wrote [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-09-23]].

Encountered the quote: [[Examine what is said not the one who says it â€” de Mello]].

### Writing

### Photography

### Walking
- I walked at Lantican (towards Forestry) and Pancho.

### Projects

Insurance
- Pushed through with my application and received a temporary insurance coverage.
- I experienced revealing a condition (my punctured eardrum). I was advised not to declare it.
- I told Nicco I won't continue with PruLife and we were civil about it.

### Others
- Canceled Kindle Unlimited.
- Lea introduced me to Community which I started watching.
