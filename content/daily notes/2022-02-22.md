I am grateful for:

1. Being able to let go of my avoidant behavior and helping my friends.
2. Being able to hold space for Lea last night.
3. Another 24 hours of life given to me.

"I will find the right action."

# Review

## Studies

I bought Ran Lahav’s book Deep Philosophy and started reading it. I realized that his approach is heavier on the contemplation side that the analytical side of philosophy—too heavy that he puts more importance on depth understanding, a form of understanding beyond reason. This made me a bit less interested to his approach. But the best thing that came out of this encounger is that I am inspired to think deeper about the difference between rationalism and empiricism.

I also discovered this article which I will read soon, about the historical explanation of the separation of philosophy and contemplation: [https://brill.com/view/title/38845](https://brill.com/view/title/38845)
