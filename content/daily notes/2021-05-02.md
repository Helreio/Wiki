I am grateful for:

1. Being able to express myself to Claire about nature and environmental issues.
2. Being able to express myself to Lea about the money issue and feeling that I am heard.
3. To be in this situation where I have the things that I currently have and the loved ones that color my day.

"I am a steward of Nature."
