## I am grateful for:
1. This meditation practice, which has grounded me for so long and which has served as a sanctuary for when times were tough. And now, they are tough.
2. This reminder to honor my boundaries, to honor who I am, and to love while still honoring them.
3. Freedom for making my morning more focused and intentional.

## Affirmation

"I can love someone without sacrificing who I am."

## Review
### Studies

I journaled some more ideas about walking that I could include in Lilim 03(05).

I started processing highlights and annotations from Ultralearning and created these new notes:
- [[Nine universal principles of ultralearning]]
- [[Ultralearning â€” Young]]
- [[Concept handles, after Alexander]]
- [[Use positive note titles]]
- [[thoughts/use complete declarative or imperative phrases in note titles]]
- [[Treat note titles like concept handles]]
- [[How to write good note titles]]

I also modified:
- [[Self-directed learning]]
- [[How James Clear used ultralearning to improve his writing]]
