I am grateful for:

1. Being able to course correct in terms of my weight loss management. I didn't realize my height wasn't actually accurate.
2. My conversation with Lea last night. I was able to deliver my request to be mindful of how much we spend on meryenda.
3. Being able to course correct on my plans to start a Patreon page. The workshop is making me realize that I really do need to start things the right way in terms of building an audience.

To do

- [x] Morning writing practice
- [x] Continue watching the Patreon workshop
