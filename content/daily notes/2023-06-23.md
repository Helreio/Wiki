## I am grateful for:
1. Kako and Kitkat
2. Being home alone here in Sta. Maria (note: I wrote Sta. Maria but this was meant to be Cablong. My unconscious misses Sta. Maria) this beautiful morning.
3. The movie last night, which was kinda decent.

## Affirmation

"Believe."

## Review

Worked on Candent's Target Customer Segment. I learned a lot about Filipino celebrities with children who have special needs.

Started doing competitive analysis for Candent.

Watched Lost Ollie ep. 2 at lunch.

Did SEP 271.

Rode my bike along Matic-Maticâ€“Maronong Road for the first time in quite a while.
