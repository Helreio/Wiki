## I am grateful for:
1. The hand and foot spa experience last night. The soles of my feet were scrubbed for the first time in my entire life.
2. The first essay from the book Wilderness and the Heart. It was about walking as motivators to Thoreau and Bugbee.
3. Being back in LB and feeling more authentic and myself again.

## Affirmation

"I live in the present moment."

## Review

I journaled about the first few highlights I took on the essay "Answering the Call of the Wild: Walking with Bugbee and Thoreau" by Daniel W. Conway. This inspired me to write a poem: [[ang unang liwayway]].

I created the note [[poems/namumulaklak]].

I read [Things I Like About Christianity](https://steve-patterson.com/things-i-like-about-christianity/) by Steve Patterson.

I reached out to Goan.

I continued reading the OVIC overviews.

While having lunch, Lea and I watched Teenage Bounty Hunters.

I played Dota Underlords.

I finished reading all the OVIC overviews while having merienda.

I walked at Pili Drive.

While having dinner, Lea and I watched Wakanda Forever.

I washed the dishes then prepared to sleep.
