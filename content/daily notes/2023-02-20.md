## I am grateful for:
1. Doing well during my first discovery call.
2. An invitation to apply at a Rotary fellowship.
3. The courage to go outside my comfort zone and grow.

## Affirmation

"I will ace the research writing test."

## Review

I immediately started with the writing test for my application as research writer for Krys Tolentino. For this project, I created the following notes:
- [[Inclusion experiences of persons with disabilities in the workplace]]
- [[Trends and opportunities in research on disability and work]]

While having lunch, Lea and I watched two episodes of Community. The final episodes for Season 3.

I finished the test until 7 pm after which I sent it.

Lea and I had dinner. After dinner, we played two games of Sequence.

After playing, I walked at Ruby–Velasco–Carabao Park–Lopez–Halcon.

I then washed the dishes while listening to an episode from The Modern Editor Podcast about 5 things the podcaster should have done when she was starting out.

After washing the dishes, I checked my right ear drum. I thought it was peforated but it wasn't.

Then I learned that I got the research writing job. Lea and I celebrated.
