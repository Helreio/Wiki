## I am grateful for:
1. The realization at the walk yesterday: my calling is religious. Therefore, I need to focus on that while I experiment on the side.
2. Being generally healthy about my boundaries even if I still need to do some work.
3. The reminder that it is important that I find a day job soon.

## Affirmation

"I will find a day job."

## Review

Walked: Data–Ruby–Halcon–Lopez (and back) to send Lea off.

I began evaluating my creative routines vis a vis my goals and modified them.

Lunch + Peaky Blinders

Continued working on Ili's website.
- Got into problem about pushing the staging site into production.
- Realized that using WP Staging was a bad idea if I don't buy the Pro version.
- I basically destroyed the site.
- Luckily, there was a system restore in Hostinger.

Walked: Data–Ruby–Velasco–Ela–Rambutan–Pili
Back: Pili–Rambutan–Ela–Lopez–Santos–Diamond–Banahaw–Pearl–Ruby–Data

Dinner + Set up a local staging environment using Local by Flywheel.
