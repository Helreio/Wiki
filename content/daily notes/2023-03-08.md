## I am grateful for:
1. Receiving my pay from Bookbright which provides me with some buffer for the next two months.
2. My productive call with Krys. I feel more comfortable with her now and feel more motivated to make the paper better.
3. Being here where I am today.

## Affirmation

"I tolerate differences. I am kind."

## Review

I continued working on the Iclusion paper revision.

Continued watching NHIE at lunch.

Watched Chris Rock's Selective Outrage over dinner.
