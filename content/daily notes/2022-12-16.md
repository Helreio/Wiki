## I am grateful for:
1. Being alive.
2. Feeling anger, annoyance, lack of confidence. These are children of my mind. They are part of who I am.
3. Accomplishing that show notes yesterday. Unlike editing, it was something I actually enjoyed. It wasn't that much work.

## Affirmation

"I am not my livelihood. I have done a lot to transform my life, my inner life, and that is where my real work is. That is where I should worry whether I am doing well or not."

## Review

While journaling, I reviewed the metalearning process that Scott Young laid out in Ultralearning. I started by articulating my motivations for studying copywriting. I then wrote the agenda for my interview with Lea and the questions I wanted to ask her.

I browsed through available works at Upwork.

Lea and I had lunch while watching Dash and Lily.

After lunch, I interviewed Lea to extract action steps I need to take to learn copywriting in a way that serves Sariah's needs moving forward.

While having merienda, I finished writing the shownotes for LLP E02. The episode was interesting. It was about the power of the pitch.

Lea and I walked until Grove. We bought Bactidol and shawarma. Lea went ahead to buy groceries while I continued walking at Pili Drive.

When I returned, we watched Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix while having dinner.

I played two games of ML (1-1) before going to bed.
