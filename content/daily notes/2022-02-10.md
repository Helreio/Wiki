# Review

## Studies

I journaled about a possible solution to publishing my notes as a website as well as a minimum viable design for my main website which will point to the notes.

## Projects

### Learn web development

I paused studying CSS through Angela’s course and decided to tinker today. The problem I am trying to solve is how I can publish my Talahardin through a custom domain.

I went through a lot of solutions:

- My initial solution, which I also journaled about, was to have a collection of markdown files, use a markdown editor to edit them, and use a static site generator + github + CDN to publish them.
- Following this model, I tried looking for a solution where I could keep my notes in Bear then publish them in Github. This didn’t work for me.
- Then I realized that I should look for a solution that does not require me to migrate all my notes to a new app (i.e., use Craft docs).
- I encountered Vessel which solved my problem among other functionalities. But the software seems to be an abandoned project.
- That’s when I learned about the solution by Zuolan at [https://zuolan.me/craft_custom_domain_en#ee5117211b244ee182ba6ad71d5fa053](https://zuolan.me/craft_custom_domain_en#ee5117211b244ee182ba6ad71d5fa053). I tried applying it, even transferred KNU to Cloudflare just to do it. But it didn't work out. And so I continued looking for other solutions.
- While doing all these, I learned better how to work with domain names and servers. I learned how to create subdomains. We can only do so where the domains are hosted (not registered).
- I went back to Evernote and checked if it could support backlinks. I know that there is an Evernote app that lets you create pages directly through notes and edit them there. But without bidirectional linking, I can’t go back to Evernote.
- I searched the Zettelkasten forum for answers. Sascha was against publishing notes online. Christian shared how Andy Matuschak does it, which mirrors the model I thought about, but of course is not detailed. Both of them suggested DokuWiki, which is a solution that does not require coding.
- I also discovered neuron: [https://neuron.zettel.page/](https://neuron.zettel.page/)
- I discovered Zettlr.
- Bearblogr
- Emanote: [https://emanote.srid.ca/](https://emanote.srid.ca/)
- I also watched a free alternative to Obsidian Publish: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7r3Agdk8M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ7r3Agdk8M). This made me realize that using this free alternative for obsidian has more friction and I may not be able to use it. So I'm sticking to Craft.
- I looked for other Craft-based solutions at the Slack community of Craft and found this: [https://craft-website-demo.netlify.app/](https://craft-website-demo.netlify.app/). I transfered KNU back to Netlify. But upon application, I realized that what this solution does is simply to cloak the domain. This isn't what I want, so I abandoned the solution.

I downloaded Coins.ph and sent Php 10,000 in it.
