## I am grateful for:
1. My conversation with Benjie last night. I enjoyed the candor, honesty, and patience in going through the process.
2. The opportunity to help Diwa with her project and practice my photography at the same time.
3. Feeling a sense of joy after seeing Kitkat, which reminded me of the joy I do feel around family no matter how imperfect, a joy I am not sure I am ready to lose.

## Affirmation

"I will find my freedom soon."
