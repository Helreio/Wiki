## Review
### Studies

### Projects

**My Writing Life Project**

I journaled about my baseline writing, reading, and community achievements so far.

I continued improving Lilim 03(03).

Continued reading DIY MFA.

I read the story "The Yellow Wallpaper." It was a great example of character development. I learned about the TADA method. Show thoughts, actions, dialogue, and appearance. You can manipulte these elements depending on the kind of character. In the Yellow Wallpaper, the woman has more thoughts and dialogue, while the wallpaper has actions and appearance. We can see this by using the character compass.

### Others

- Watched Better Call Saul.
- I had an exchange of conversation with Rom about his new book and the process he went through to release it.
