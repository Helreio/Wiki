I am grateful for:

1. Lea's questions yesterday.
2. Lesser fleas last night.
3. My long talahardin session yesterday.

"My purpose is to savor every thought and sensation that makes me come alive."

Amazing

- Continued working on Talahardin development.
- Walked towards IRRI housing and back. I felt really good walking under bamboos.
- Went to Diwa and Ju and chatted for an hour. Kamustahan and vulnerable convos.
- Met Janges
- Continued How I Met
