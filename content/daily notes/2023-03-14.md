## I am grateful for:
1. The opportunity to talk with Maui and Yano and help them with their vision. And more importanlty just hangout with them.
2. Yesterday's progress in my metalearning. I am starting to notice the most important areas for me to focus on.
3. The walk that I had last night and the thinking it gave about writing the book about LB.

## Affirmation

"I am capable of establishing a good sleeping habit."
