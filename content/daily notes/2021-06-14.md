I am grateful for:

1. Every good and fun thing that happened yesterday. I love my life.
2. My fate. I love my fate.
3. The realization that this was the first challenge I had regarding loss of money. In the past, my losses were loss of potential earning income (AMA problem) and being separated from a large sum of my money for a long time (refunds in Shopee). Now I am actually in a real situation where a loss of a large sum of my money might actually be a fact.

"I love my fate."

Amazing

- Walked to pick up my laundry and buy merienda.
- Tasted Catchy Pan's Lemon Pepper boneless bangus.
- Sent message to the gang telling them how grateful I am.
- Receive message from Rem inviting me to an agenda-less catch up.
- Walked around UP. Checked what is in Do√±a Aurora road.
