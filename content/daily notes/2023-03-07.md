## I am grateful for:
1. A wonderful picnic yesterday at Freedom Park to celebrate Lea's birthday. We had great food and a chill weather.
2. Learning that I will be receiving my pay tomorrow from Bookbright. The pay secures at least two months more helping me focus on learning editing in the coming weeks.
3. Kako being okay back at home.

## Affirmation

"My life is wonderful. I love it just the way it is."

## Review

In the morning, I prepared for my call with Krys by taking a closer look at her feedback. Our meeting went really good. I was able to understand what is expected of me. Later this day, I prepared a detailed todo list of things I need to accomplish before the deadline on Saturday.

While having lunch, Lea and I continued watching Never Have I Ever.

I played Underlords before going to a walk.

First, I walked with Lea to Grove. Then, I walked toward Forestry. I walked at Pancho and climbed over the large tree that fell down. From my vantage point, I was able to see the full moon over the sky above the mountains of Laguna. It made me connect to who I want to become.

I felt a bit odd, which I think was the effect of the medicine taper.

In the evening, I had dinner while watching Cobra Kai.

I then started revising the research proposal by rewriting the Overview.
