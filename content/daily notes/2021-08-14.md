I am grateful for:

1. The opportunity to see my friends again today and to experience pottery for the first time in my life.
2. The Shopee problem resolving itself.
3. My body telling me things have to change.

"I am in control of my body."

Amazing

- I journaled about what I am currently feeling.
- Went to Satya and bonded with people.
- Talked to Alex for the first time.
- Did pottery for the first time.
- Tasted garlic vine on peanuts.
