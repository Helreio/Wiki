I am grateful for:

1. Seeing my friends again after three weeks.
2. Being remembered by Diwa. She asked me how I am and my cats and opened up about her depressive episode.
3. Having Lea around. It just makes things a little more interesting in the house.

“I am a really, really good friend.”

Amazing

- Continued improving my understanding of what I want to do.
- Updated my daily routine and workflow.
- Wrote and shared my first Yesterday, I post on social media.
- Brought Shorty to the vet.
- Had a date with Lea. Tasted the fries and halo-halo at Agapita.
- Walked around.
