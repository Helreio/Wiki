I am grateful for:

1. Knowing that Claire is okay and getting better.
2. Seeing that Benjie looks fine and hearing that they'll come by August.
3. Having Lea around.

"I will better express myself."

Amazing

- Finished watching iPS.
- Went at the batis and went down for a few minutes with Lea.
- Ate again at Japanese restaurant.
- Watched a wondeful movie, "The Intern".
