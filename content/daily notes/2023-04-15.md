## Review

Lea and I woke up early to support Uwa on his tea meditation.

The tea meditation helped us find our center and celebrate Uwa's bravery.

We went back home to have lunch, work a bit, then sleep.

Then we returned to the gallery for the clay workshop.

I joined Ms. An and her sister-in-law, Ms. Vina, during the workshop, where we listened to each other's stories. I witnessed Ms. An's deep love to ceramics.

We also met some new acquaintances from Calamba and Cabuyao, as well as Cayo, an artist from LB.

To cap the day, we had a brief workshop on Pangalay lead by Maui.

Then we had dinner with Cris Garcimo at Bonito's.
