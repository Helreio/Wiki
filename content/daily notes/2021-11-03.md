I am grateful for:

1. Being able to sleep earlier than usual and not feeling sleepy right now.
2. Finding a place to stay in that allows unvaccinated guests.
3. Discovering the knowledge cycle process.

"I will make the most of November by making progress in the things that are critical and important for me."
