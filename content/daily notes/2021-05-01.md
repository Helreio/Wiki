I am grateful for:

1. The attention I am getting from the Yesterday, I posts, which I know I shouldn't expect a lot on. But as a writer, it feels good to feel like what I'm putting out in the world resontes with someone else.
2. Being able to administer Shorty's medictions finally. I really hope this all ends soon for her, so she can live a better life and be healthier.
3. Walking inside UP after a long time.
