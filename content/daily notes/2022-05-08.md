## I am grateful for:
1. My walk yesterday. It really was up to me to look closer and make my walks meaningful.
2. Finishing to upload the books for sale and selling some to Rem.
3. Trying out no screens by 10 and sleeping earlier and better. 

## Affirmation

"I could articulate my needs clearer."

## Review
### Studies

Processed a lot of journal entries.

Wrote notes for:
- [[vignettes/kalachuchi]]
- [[Maintain a feedback loop between the structural and the individual]]
- [[poems/kung paano maglakad]]

While outdoors, I wrote an articulate note about why experience is a more important method in learning how to live. I included the insight in the structure note for [[thoughts/how to live]]

### Projects

**My Writing Life Project**

Continued reading A Pilgrim

**Insurance**

Started extracting my notes on insurance and creating an MOC note for them. I also created new notes and prompts to be returned to later.

### Others

- Settled issue with Lea.
- Went to Siento. Amazing!
- Walked at UP.
- Finished watching Master of None season 3. Amazing.7
