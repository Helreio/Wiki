I am grateful for:

1. The advocate arriving today. Finally, I hope this all ends.
2. This day. An opportunity to continue my monthly review, start my projects, and be with Lea.
3. Having the resources to help Mama and Kako.

"Just start."

Amazing

- Finished my monthly review.
- Cooked sarciado.
- Continued Arcane.
- Took a walk at UP. They lighted the belen and prevented people from passing at the middle.
- Had an epiphany about tweaking my writing process: combining walking and thinking in a newsletter.
- Discovered Fredric Gross, author of A Philosophy of Walking.
