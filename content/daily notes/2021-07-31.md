I am grateful for:

1. Being aware of what has happened in the organization.
2. Earning around 46k for next month.
3. The courage I had back then... to leave, which I am only truly completing now.

"I am brave. I built a wonderful life outside that organization."

Amazing

- I was able to return to my morning routine.
- I journaled about my realizations after watching the documentary.
- I processed two diary entries and wrote some notes.
- I went to Likhaya's second launch.
- I went to the poetry session at Satya.
- I had hot choco and long conversation with friends.
- I started watching Malcolm Gladwell's masterclass.
- I had a very lively and fun conversation with Lea.
