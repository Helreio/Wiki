I am grateful for:

1. These insights coming from Craig Mod about identifying what work to do and what actions to take.
2. The endless pursuit of listening to yourself, identifying what makes you tick, what turns you on, what is the best use of the little time you have in this world.
3. Being in a position where I am able to think about these questions and just embrace the unknown.

"I am intentional in protecting my mind and making the most out of my time."
