I am grateful for:

1. Seeing ate Mau and her family, knowing that they're ll alright despite the challenges.
2. Being with Lea visiting the Laguna lake yesterday.
3. Ginhawa's anniversary.

"I am a loving tito."

Amazing

- Journaled about my life work.
- Tried to help Lea have her laptop repaired.
- Processed Evernote notes.
- Lea slept here for one more night and we just did slept.
