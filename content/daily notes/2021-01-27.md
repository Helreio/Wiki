I am grateful for:

1. This psychological conundrum, for helping me see where I may have a problem. There are fears that I have. There is inner work I need to do.
2. This opportunity to help Maui and start a “real” connection with her.
3. My life. Everything I have to go through since leaving college in 2013. This was my life. This is my life. I need to really, really love every single piece of it.

To do

- [x] Daily Writing Routine
- [x] Take a photo of your workplace and send to Ime
