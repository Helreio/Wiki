## I am grateful for:
1. Yesterday, a day spent with Lea. I allowed myself to spend my time around her needs and listen to her.
2. Finding the patience and nonjudgement to listen to Lea and focus on finding solutions.
3. Being able to continue working on the Palanca essay.

## Affirmation

"Everything will be alright."

## Review

I continued rewriting the Palanca essay.

I read [The Last Days by Ali Millar review – a rebellious Jehovah’s Witness memoir](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/24/the-last-days-by-ali-millar-review-a-rebellious-jehovahs-witness-memoir) . Through the article, I also discovered the film Apostasy.

I decided to put a epitaph before the essay about the forty-year wilderness wandering of Israelites.

Had lunch while watching Grace and Frankie.

The dining table arrived and I set it up along with a chair.

I had merienda while reading a proposal for social media management.

Underlords.

Walked to Pili Drive under rain.

Had dinner while watching Promising Young Woman.
