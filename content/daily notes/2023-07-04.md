## I am grateful for:
1. Finding that Homepage layout and that YouTube channel to help me layout Ili's site.
2. The film "The Lives of Others." It really stays with you.
3. Just being with Lea and having her with me, making my existence a little less lonely.

## Affirmation

"I am a mentally and emotionally tough person who can go through a stressful situation and persevere."
