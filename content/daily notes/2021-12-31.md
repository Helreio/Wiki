## I am grateful for:
1. My conversation last night with Lea. It made me realize a few things about what I truly feel about helping Mama out.
2. Mama and Papa reaching this age. I am profoundly thankful.
3. The simple exercise that is thinking about my budget and the realization I had from it.

## Affirmation

"I am giving. I know how to feel good when giving."

## Review

### Studies

I journaled about budgeting my food, reasons why I might keep the apartment, and talking to Lea about contributing with the rent.

I continued reading APOW (Chapter 11). I processed Chapter 8 and wrote a note about silence in walking.

### Projects

#### Web Design

I continued watching the Flux Web Design course. I watched the video on finding inspiration. According to Ran, we need to find inspiration in two places: in the field of web design itself and in other fields or disciplines. Within web design, he suggested visiting Awwards or Lapa Ninja for inspirations. I browsed these websites to look for inspirations. He suggested using Invision boards to collect and organize these inspirations. He advised on looking for inspiration outside web design to make sure that oneâ€™s design has never done in the past. He suggested looking at books, music, films, etc. and collecting visual artifacs that we can use for inspiration.

I also watched the video on tools to develop a site. Ran offered a very helpful way of looking at the available tools. Web development tools lie on a spectrum. At the far end are tools where one needs to code the site from scratch. At the other far end is designing a site using templates and modules (Squarespace, Wix). At the middle are tools that give you more flexibility but does not require you to code because there is a UI for code element (Webflow, Editor X).

I read the comments of the video and checked the other tools that other designers use. I saw Oxygen, and others. But the most interesting for me was the Jamstack. Jamstack is not an editor but a workflow. It stands for Javascript + API + Markdown. It combines the pros of static sites and dynamic sites into a revolutionary system in web development that is cheaper, more secure, and faster. I visited the following sites to read more about it:

[For fast and secure sites | Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)

[WTF is Jamstack?](https://jamstack.wtf/)

I watched a few videos and realized that this is most probably what Craig Mod does in building a website. This was also the style used by that person with the Hugo tutorial I was watching in the past. I followed along this article: [https://www.jeremymorgan.com/blog/programming/how-to-build-jamstack-site/](https://www.jeremymorgan.com/blog/programming/how-to-build-jamstack-site/) (until I can no longer follow it) to give me a taste of the process. I also read: [https://www.jeremymorgan.com/blog/programming/static-site-hugo-netlify/](https://www.jeremymorgan.com/blog/programming/static-site-hugo-netlify/) which convinced me to build a site using Hugo and Netlify.

I opened a Github account. It really has a cool onboarding process. I also updated Brew and Git in my computer.

I also discovered other site builders like Wowchemy, a sitebuilder based on Hugo.

### Others

I listened to one of the best synthpop albums of all time.
