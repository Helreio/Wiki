## I am grateful for:
1. The world I can see and my ability to see it.
2.  Mama for doing all the laundry.
3.  The opportunity to study.

## What will I do to make today great.

1.  I'll try to go through some of my ideas, see if I can make a resolution on some things.
2.  Review transition plan, see if it still holds.
3.  Find a way to connect with yourself.

## Affirmation

I am on the path. I just need to define it clearer.

## 3 amazing things that happened today

1.  Read Who's Your City? Thought-provoking. I am forced to think about my future. But of course, given that I will still change, in the near future. Nothing will be final.
2.  Inspired by the story of RJI.
3.  Amazing how I cant think of anything amazing to say.
