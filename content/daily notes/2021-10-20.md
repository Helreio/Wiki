I am grateful for:

1. My friends for understanding our need to go to Quezon.
2. Kerwin for getting back to me.
3. Being alive today.

"I am a contemplative."

Amazing

- I journaled about the collage approach to writing and a few points about what kind of writing I want to write.
- I continued reading Montaigne's biography.
- I mopped the floor downstairs while listening to a podcast interview with Michael Malice.
- I watched Squid Game with Lea.
- I cooked pork adobo and ate it with Lea.
- Fruit Salad: I got to share about my recent discoveries on writing and Montaigne.
