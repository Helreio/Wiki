## I am grateful for:
1. Having a bus to ride for Lea.
2. Being able to walk this morning and see sights along the way.
3. The opportunity to mind walk today.

## Affirmation

"I will make the most out of this day."

## Review

Walked from Matic-Matic to house after sending Lea home.
Took photos of farmers laying ilik on the road, Matic-Matic bridge sign, the river, an interesting ad on a tree, and a mother duck with her ducklings.
Meditated then journaled about yesterday.
Wrote daily reviews for previous days.
Developed a poem draft I wrote at Binloc entitled [[poems/what I have]].
Extracted a seedling from [[Kapag Natagpuan Kita = Once I Find You — Rofel Brion]] note: [[thoughts/noelle de jesus translation process]].
Finished reading [[thoughts/living philosophy by edward mooney]] Chapter 6.
Reviewed notes from Chapter 2 of Living Philosophy and wrote a few literature notes with potential of becoming evergreens. I particularly enjoyed writing about experience first before explanation, which relates to [[Show, don’t tell]].
Read the latest Photo Meditations newsletter entitled ["Beginner Mind"](https://photomeditation.substack.com/p/beginner-mind) right before the golden hour. When the golden hour arrived, I took more photos.
Rode my bike to my favorite trail at Matic-Matic, then walked.
I went to Tita Nelly to have dinner with my cousins and family.
Called Lea to see her and the cats.
