I am grateful for:

1. All the voices challenging the mainstream narrative on covid.
2. Lea, for doing this with me hand on hand. I feel so close to her right now.
3. Life - the mysteries, the joy, the emotions, that make this one hell of a ride

"I am sentimental and sensitive. And that's what anchors me in life."

Amazing

- Continued watching Mr. Robot.
- Amazing evening with Lea.
