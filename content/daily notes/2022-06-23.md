## I am grateful for:
1. Being in a better place after years and years of struggle.
2. The labong and santol recipe yesterday.
3. Three more days before I go back to work - more opportunities to deepen the meaning of my life.

## Affirmation

"I have the power of making each moment worth it."

## Review
### Studies

### Writing

I journaled about what the rain last night triggered.

Continued reading Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.

I transferred my thoughts on Kissa by Kissa from my diary to [[Kissa by Kissa â€” Mod]]

Finished reading Kissa by Kissa at Homespun. It made me realize that I want to focus on writing walking narratives.
