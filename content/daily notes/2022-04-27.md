## I am grateful for:
1. Finding the 567 resort yesterday, paying good price, and having a great time with my family.
2. All the laughter. For the first time, in a very long time, even if Bernice and Papa are not talking to Ate long, I felt like I had a normal family yesterday.
3. Nature writers who have blazen our path.

## Affirmation
I am a nature writer.
