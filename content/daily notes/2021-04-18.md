I am grateful for:

1. Lea for being very positive about life despite all the challenges she is going through. She celebrates the positive and it is something I need to do more.
2. Kerwin for providing me with something I have needed for a very long time: a constant intellectual companion.
3. Seeing that the dogs at balitbitan are relatively okay.

“I will use my strengths to be happy today.”

Amazing

- Wrote notes about my intellectual history
- Wrote notes from Square One axioms
- Replied to Kerwin and set the stage for discussion
