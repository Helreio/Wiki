## I am grateful for:
1. This true alone time I have for myself.
2. Meeting new friends yesterday esp. kuya Rom and kuya Allan.
3. Really feeling better now in terms of my headache.

## Affirmation

"I will make the most out of this solitude."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about the mountain streets of LB and how [[Rewalking the same space opens the possibility of closeness with it]].

I wrote the following notes:
- [[Commodity exchange facilitates freedom and individualism]]
- [[Art is a gift]]
- [[Ways we can practice the gift today]]
- [[Gift communities are typically small]]

I continued reading The Gift.
