## I am grateful for:
1. Rem's inspiring feedback on my poetry in general.
2. Learning and creating IG presets at LrC.
3. Yesterday's walk.

## Affirmation

"I will see the world."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about how to develop voice and vision in both writing and photography.

### Writing

I continued reading Open City.

I discovered Martijn Doolaard, building a cabin in the Italian Alps who also had two books about riding a bike for a year: https://youtube.com/c/MartijnDoolaard

I also discovered this cool mosaic sticker artist: https://youtu.be/I9X6VqkVaIQ

I continued reading A Life Without Principle.

### Photography

I finalized my other linked notes in [[Develop photos in Lightroom Classic to share to Instagram]].

I finally ordered a Canon M50 Mark II via Shopee after watching several videos the entire afternoon on how to choose a good camera and reviews about the model. What ultimately convinced me to buy was the price in Shopee which was 10k less that in Photoline and Canon store itself.

I then updated my note in my obsidian about [[How to choose a camera]] based on the videos I watched.

### Walking

### Projects
