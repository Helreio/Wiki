I am grateful for:

1. Being at home and not having to think about food. I can just focus on studying and making the most out of my time here.
2. The rain yesterday. It made everything cooler. Made this place feel better. The frogs croaking reminded me of the mornings I woke up in Sta. Maria.
3. The transcend book for articulating the things I need.

"I am on my path towards self-actualization and transcendence."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about what health is. I also wrote about the problem I am having with using the spaced repetition writing system I have implemented in Craft. I thought about using tags to organize my Inbox by interests easier ([[Tags can be used to help process the writing inbox in lieu of a spaced repetition writing system]]).

I also defined what a [[convergence tool]] is.

I continued updating my life management system, particularly articulating what the reviews are meant to do. Now, I just have to think really deeply about project management.
