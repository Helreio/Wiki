I am grateful for:

1. Lea arriving
2. A sunnier morning
3. Fourth day working and I might be able to end it here

"I am no longer alone."

Others

- Lea and I ate lunch at Mint + Snow. It was my treat to her for paying off her credit card debt once and for all.
- I continued watching HIMYM.
- I received a 1 star review in Scribendi, scored 82/100 but still failed because it was a valid complaint. That's okay as long as I got paid. But even if I don't, I have enough earnings anyway.
