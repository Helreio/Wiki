## I am grateful for:
1. This commitment to create this space, a four-hour space, without social media and email, so I could just commune with the children of my mind.
2. Walking, for teaching me how to live deliberately.
3. Poetry for teaching me how to look at the world better.

## Affirmation

"I am a walking human being."

## Review

I reported a misdelivered item from Shopee.

I started writing my "script" for the walking workshop.

I then continued working on the pubmats.

We had lunch while watching The Kominsky Method Season 2 finale.

I played Underlords.

I started my Weekly Review while having a snack, and wrote:
- [[You are the example - Clear]]
- [[Let no one think it is an easy way - Milner]]

Lea and I attended Tita Glo's lecture about the history of Ilihan in the Philippines.

After the lecture, I continued walking around the campus.

Back home, Lea and I had dinner. Then I tried migrating Pathfinder's Commune but faced a hiccup so I stopped.

I played Underlords.

Then I reconciled our funds.

Then I prepared to sleep.
