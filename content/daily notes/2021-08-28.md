I am grateful for:

1. Having something to look forward to today - seeing friends after two weeks.
2. The freedom once more.
3. Another week of no social media. I have done well.

"I am compassionate, kind, and understanding of people who think differently."

Amazing

- Finally saw how people think in Ju's group. The hidden reason behind Hugpungan.
- Tasted one of the best sandwhiches I ever tasted and its vegetarian!
- Met Marky's friends.
- Tasted vegetarian Filipino spaghetti.
- Talked about our career moves and plans.
