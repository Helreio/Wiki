## I am grateful for:
1. Being able to resist temptation. Remembering my purpose. My peace. Reading the stoic advice to avoid places of temptation.
2. Yesterday’s fun grocery, pad thai, and other adventures. It was proof that I am happy with Lea, and that I need to value what I have with her.
3. This beautiful sunny day. Looking forward to my walk later.
