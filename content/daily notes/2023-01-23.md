## I am grateful for:
1. Meeting Rio and Mac, and experiencing their hospitality.
2. Returning to Casa San Pablo and seeing Sampaloc Lake once more.
3. Realizing a few important stuff about parenting and adulting.

## Affirmation

"I will make big strides in my life design project today."

## Review

I journaled about our full weekend, visiting Dampalit Falls then San Pablo. I listed my top values and expenses for Champy's prophylaxis.

I wrote [[vignettes/a walk to dampalit falls]].

I re-took the values test to finalize the list of my values.

I reviewed my [[private/2023 personal narrative vision]] and included it into [[My Pivot Plan]].

Lea and I continued watching Maid while having lunch.

After lunch, I went to LBC to send Lex's book orders.

I did my Weekly Review.

I walked at Viado.

I started contacting Dr. Maying for Champy's prophylaxis.

During dinner, I watched Cobra Kai.

I then reconciled our finances.
