I am grateful for:

1. The care and attention that Dr. Carlo showed yesterday to Shortyâ€™s case.
2. The antibiotic doing its work on Shorty.
3. The emotional education I am getting the past few days.

To do

- [x] Finish Weekly Review.
- [x] Use Mycocide to wash Shorty.
- [ ] Bring Champy to the vet.

Amazing

- First time to wash Shorty using Mycocide. It was challenging.
- Brought Champy to the vet, bought medicine at Furbabies.
- Had a very fulfilling conversation with Fruit Salad.
