I am grateful for:

1. That iPhone 7 plus for serving me for 3 years.
2. This particular experience. I learned how intricate cp repair is. I better get it repaired by someone else next time if I want to continue using a smartphone.
3. Yesterday's time with Lea. I was able to articulate my goals for 2022.

"I am capable of doing a good decision in terms of making a purchase."

### iPhone

I decided to change the trajectory of this entire project by:

- Buying a second-hand iPhone 11 Pro Max from a credible source.
- Selling the iPhone 11 Pro once and for all.

My main reason for doing this decision is that I need to move past the issue and pursue my original goal, which was to have a single quality phone with a good camera that I would be using for years to come, much like I did with my iPhone 7 Plus.

I will now move forward with selling the 11 Pro and continuing to study how I can take even more care of my new iPhone.

Here are some things I learned from this project:

- Always buy the lowest storage of a phone then just use iCloud for your storage needs. See: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un5S2N5is90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un5S2N5is90)
- Turn off low power mode when charging phone.
- I like this video about questions to ask before buying something new: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wampa0EF7Gs&t=227s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wampa0EF7Gs&t=227s)
- I like this video about when to buy a new phone: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pHCumGHgwk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pHCumGHgwk)

## Others

Lea and I ate at The Sandwhich Guy

I continued watching HIMYM. Season 8 episode 17 (ashtray) is probably my most favorite of all episodes.

Listened to Lorde’s album “Melodrama”

Lea shared her coaching call with Sariah, which inspired me to drill even deeper into my projects and the changes I want to see in my life this year.
