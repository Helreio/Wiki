I am grateful for:

1. Reading Dave Ursillo once again. I was lost ang looking for a guide when I first came across his blog. The authenticity continues to amaze me. Yes he can be self-centered. But he is doing it unapologetically and that is what's amazing.
2. This space. For providing me with somewhere I could start to grow and do my work. I know it is not the most ideal, but it is cooler and quieter than other parts of LB.
3. That photograph that Tita Nok sent me. It reminded me of a beautiful distant past that I would pay everything I have just to experience again.

To do

- [x] Journal
- [x] Review life work system and try to solve gaps
- [ ] Accomplish batch tasks in Things.

"I will get to the bottom of this."

Amazing
