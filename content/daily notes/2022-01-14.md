I am grateful for:

1. Fixing the issue with Lea last night.
2. Seeing Lipa, Batangas once again, tasting their Lomi, and visiting the two churches.
3. Feeling a bit better after stopping caffeine consumption.

### Thoreau website

Realized how to transform a normal post into a page in Hugo.

- Disabled dates in post.

I reinstalled Congo as a module. I learned how to use Hugo Modules.

I learned to use index.md as a homepage.

I properly fixed the siteâ€™s Favicon by creating a favicon.html file under layouts/partials

## Others

Walked to UP with Lea.

Watched Pan de Salawal.
