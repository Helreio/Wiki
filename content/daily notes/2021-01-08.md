I am grateful for:

1. Finally in a place of my own here in Los Banos. It was not easy to finally be in this place but I already am.
2. Lea being able to go home last night even if it was already late.
3. Finally having my first date with Lea after 300 days. I really miss all the past dates and restaurant explorations we had. I am so grateful that we got to spend a day together.

To do:

- [x] Do my daily morning writing routine.
- [ ] Write an annual gratitude list.
- [x] List things I need to buy for the house.
- [ ] Buy a few things at the mall.

"I am patient yet firm when with my principles."
