## Review

I journaled about what I am feeling now that I am back in LB. I drew a blind contour drawing of Sirius Black with some letterings in an attempt to copy his Wanted poster at the movie.

Created the following notes:
- [[poems/random]]
- [[vocabulary expands with empathy]]

I started reading the book Sarswelang Pangasinan.

I accomplished the form that Lisa Lee sent to me for applying to the translator job. I also learned about the typical translator fees.

Read this thought-provoking article on the Filipino culture of ["utang na loob"](https://pop.inquirer.net/337599/again-children-should-not-be-treated-like-future-bank-accounts-and-retirement-plans).

Watched [Ma. Ressa's interview about her new book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpWevZ5yQz8).

I walked to buy merienda and wet cat food for my Champy. She finally ate.

While having merienda, I read how one person ([Tim Brian Brady](https://www.timbrianbrady.com/category/copywriting/copy-challenge/)) pursued a copywriting challenge.

I learned that I didn't pass the Phase Two of the PaperTrue editor application test.

In the evening, I walked again at Viado. A concert was being performed at Umali. I stopped for a while to listen to a band play Upuan by Gloc 9. Meanwhile, a night market is currently in front Baker's Hall. When I got to Carabao Park, people were watching Game 2 of UAAP. I bought some food before going home.

I had dinner while continuing to watch Tree of Life.

After dinner, I watched [Lea's first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmZYcXZP3BI) on her YouTube channel. I then sat down with her to provide some feedback.

I reconciled YNAB then went to bed for an early sleep.
