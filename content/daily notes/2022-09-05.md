## I am grateful for:
1. Being with Rem, Claire, Lea, and Kuya Rey at Pagsanjan.
2. The good food at Terema Kasih and the awesome ancestral home of Muchos Dineros.
3. Realizing the immensity of the inner work to be done.

## Affirmation

"I am a spiritual person."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I reflected about my mistakes while talking to Lea in front of my friends. I continued thinking about what I need to do to succeed in my project (i.e., to feel good about my actions).

### Writing

### Photography

### Walking
- Walked to batis.

### Projects

[[ynab]]
- Read chapters 3-5.

Insurance
- Niccolo sent me three policy samples customized for my situation. I reviewed the policies and understood what they meant.
- I then discovered how Vince Rasipura implements a BTID strategy in insurance. This convinced me to reject any VUL products and stick to term insurance and investing.
- Vince also presented a list of term insurances to check out.
- I watched the following resources:
	- [List of term insurance products in the Philippines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn_cjNoCkbo&t=445s)
	- [Health insurance na dapat unahin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yylHY1cTtcw)

### Others

- Finished watching season finale of Trying. It was a good watch.
