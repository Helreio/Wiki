## I am grateful for:
1. Being able to articulate my views on politics to Risa last night.
2. The funny story of my walk yesterday.
3. Selling some of my books successfully.

## Affirmation

"Life shall go on."

## Review
### Studies

I journaled about my feelings with the election and what Dillard has done with my writing.

I wrote: [[Listening can be transcendental]].

### Projects

**My Writing Life**

I re-read Parakaida 1 and did some revisions.
I transferred [[Riding our bikes at Cablong]] into my Talahardin.

I finished reading chapter 3 (Winter) of Pilgirm while eating nuts and seating on grass at Freedom Park.

I continued reading Desert Solitaire.

### Others

- Warriors win Game 4 against Grizzlies.
- Sent the books to Rissa. She was kind enough to give the P15 back.
- Got a haircut.
- Got my postal ID.
- Finished watching Nightcrawler.
