## I am grateful for:
1. Peace of mind and my ability to access and stay with it every day.
2. My past friends. It's easy to forget that years and years have passed. Many of them have their own lives already. Many changed almost completely. But I am grateful that they are alive and they are in a good place. I hope to reconnect with them, and with them, the past.
3. My own life story. And how it unfolded alongside all these other life stories. A lot of things could have happened but I am on this place at this time.

## What will I do to make today great

1. Create a larger plan for what I want to accomplish in my scholarship. Separate this from documenting, sharing, and teaching. Just focus on the pure craft of scholarship.
2.  Read TISH.
3. Go to Dagupan, get the BPI ATM card, visit Robinson's, and probably meet JV along the way.

## Affirmation

I am who I am right now. Yes there are many possibilities ahead. But where I am right now is where I need to be. And to stay with it is beautiful.

## 3 amazing things that happened today

1. I started my descent into ethics.
2. Bought a nice book at Dagupan.
3. Interesting observations in the jeep a while ago.
