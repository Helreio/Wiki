I am grateful for:

1. Being able to have that conversation with Lea yesterday. It was difficult but I am glad we had it.
2. The fact that none of my relatives have had adverse reactiona to the vaccine.
3. This house and the opportunity to take care of it.

"I will find an answer to this vaccination status problem soon."
