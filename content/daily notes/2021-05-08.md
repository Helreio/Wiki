I am grateful for:

1. Seeing the lake again yesterday.
2. Maui’s compliment.
3. The insights from Craig Mod yesterday.

“I am mindful.”

Amazing

- Wrote draft for Lilim 2.
- Processed diary.
- Listened to an interview with Alex Soth.
- Revisited Pulog Street and Makiling Street and felt their differences and articulated that.
- Finished Wild, Wild Country
- Had a wonderful writing session with Lea where we reflected on what kind of work moves our heart
