## I am grateful for:
1. This opportunity to be silent and alone with writing and reading. I will have around 3 hours to do that.
2. This opportunity to review my past month and set clearly the goals of the coming month.
3. Lea and I's Chewy walk this morning.

## Affirmation

"I am blessed with an exciting, creative life full of joy and meaning."
