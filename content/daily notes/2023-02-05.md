## I am grateful for:
1. Making a choice of not going to Baguio and standing by that choice.
2. Letting Lea know of my plans to look for my own clients.
3. Seeing that Chikako survived that bad asthma attack last night.

## Affirmation

"Work will eventually find me."

## Review

In my journal, I wrote about not going to Baguio and choosing to make the most of my stay in Sta. Barbara.

Created [[Walking is mapping with your feet - Elkin]].

I discovered Clay and started setting up a contact management system through it.

I connected with Kleinifer Palma.

I watched Cobra Kai while eating lunch.

I started my application at Writers.ph by fulfilling the language test.

I started re-reading Book Yourself Solid.

I walked at Carusocanâ€“Botao Road.

I watched Cobra Kai while eating dinner.

I finished my application at Writers.ph by writing the essay about the US Congress. I learned that there is a federal congress and state congresses in the United States and I discovered their differences.
