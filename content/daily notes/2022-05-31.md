## I am grateful for:
1. The rest I had last night. I feel so much better now. I am ready to take on another 26 days of freedom.
2. That complaint that was invalidated.
3. These health plans for seniors and older people, something I can buy for my parents soon.

## Affirmation

"I am going to make these next 26 days memorable and productive."

## Review
### Studies

I journaled about what I plan on doing today.

I updated some of my permanent notes about attention.

### Projects

**My Writing Life Project**

I continued reading DIY MFA. I learned about POV. There are lots of POVs: first person, second person, and third person. There are variations in each. In the first person, the narrator and the protagonist can be one or the narrator can be peripheral, i.e., the narrator follows closely behind the protagonist. Since I will be writing mostly personal essays, I am both the narrator and protagonist of my writings. I also read about world-building, which in non-fiction involves research. I also started reading about scenes and details.

I published Lilim 03(03) on the blog and shared it on social media.

### Others

- I continued watching Sex Education.
- I visited Pag-ibig Fund at Parian, Calamba and got my MID number.
