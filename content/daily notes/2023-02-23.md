## I am grateful for:
1. Learning how to write research papers once again after a very long time.
2. Cinque following up on the OVIC overviews.
3. Just being alive and okay.

## Affirmation

"I am going to write an exhaustive annotated bibliography right now."

## Review

I watched the Smart Student video on doing an annotated bibliography. Then I started writing mine.

Lea and I watched Community while having lunch.

Lea and I had another difficult conversation about her employment status.

I continued working on the inclusion paper then playing Underlords.

I walked at Viado–Roxas–Pili–Aglibut–Dawis–Ela. I sat for a while on the bleachers at the softball field.

Lea and I ate at the Batcave after which I swore I will never eat there again.

At home, I washed the dishes while listening to a YouTube playlist on the Get Clients Now method.

I then continued working on the inclusion paper then playing a couple of Underlords game before preparing for bed.
