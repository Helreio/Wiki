I am grateful for:

1. Arriving in Pangasinan safely and successfully.
2. Seeing Chikako again, as well as all members of my family.
3. Seeing Bernice and talking to her after months.

"I am a kind, understanding, and empathetic son and brother."

Amazing

- I met the guardians of my fellow passengers and learned that they were going to Imelda.
- I got an insider's understanding of the current processes in entering Pangasinan.
- Papa fetched me via motorcycle in Matic-Matic.
- Saw Kako for the first time in 8 months and she was crying.
- Met the new dogs.
- Saw Bernice and had a good convo with her.
- Talked with Papa.
- Shared lunch with the family (dinengdeng, tinapa, impangat ya sira-sira, and silvanas after).
- Saw Tita Nelly.
- Rode my bike to Botao and back via Carusocan road.
- Tasted Tito Joel's adobong itik for dinner.
