I am grateful for:

1. Gian, for affirming my ability to connect with people just by listening and asking the right questions. I feel like I do a lot by saying very little.
2. Maui, connecting with me to ask for help and offer help. This is a wonderful place to be in!
3. All these realizations that are coming to me simply because I am staying here in LB. The environment changes everything to my psyche.

To do

- [x] Continue working in Scribendi.
- [x] Bahay-bahayan

“I am where I need to be.”

Amazing

- I received a message from Maui telling me about a possible vacancy in their compound. She also asked for help about her desire to build a website for the ili.
- I finished my Scribendi deadline for today.
- Lunch: Sarsiadong bangus at pakbet + egg pie
- Bahay-bahayan: Just helped Gian with his teaching demo. Turned out, he liked the questions I asked him. He likes me. Mentioned future ideas: bahay-bahayan for weddings and anniversaries
- Started watching the secrets of the saqqara tomb
- Tasted Ome's Okara Ube Marble Loaf
- Call with Lea about 3 things: Maui's message, Gian's comment, and my plan for my birthday

Tomorrow

- Laundry
- Continue Scribendi work
- Lunch with the gang
