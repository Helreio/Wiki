* I am grateful for:
	* Finally arriving at home. It has been fun bonding with Migs and my friends in Binmaley. But I'm also so grateful and happy to be with Doji and Chikako, and just being alone, quiet, here at home.
	* Learning about the carpools to Manila that Marvin have talked about.
	* The time I spend with my friends yesterday. The laughter, the shamelessness. Things I'll miss if I'll be moving away.
* To do
	* {{[[DONE]]}} Morning routine
	* {{[[DONE]]}} Finish poem for Abbey
* "I am blessed with a beautiful community!"
* Amazing
	* I arrived home by 1 pm safely.
	* Weighed 3 kgs more.
	* Was able to do my morning routine etc.
	* Rode my bike: San Roque, Casibong, Guibel.
	* Wrote my poem for Abbey [[Pasamano]]
	* Called Lea before my Tungko call. She reported a potential retainer opportunity, which will solve her need for a day job.
	* Joined Tungko: Heard Froi's song, shared people about my recent updates, heard people talk about their Likhamon, experienced my very first exchange tula. A wonderful poem by Maui!
