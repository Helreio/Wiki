I am grateful for:

1. The iphone arriving and with near perfect condition.
2. Being able to practice discipline on my eating yesterday.
3. A wonderful night sleep.

"I am empathetic."

Amazing

- I bought the iphone photography course and learned how to hold the camera correctly. I also learned how to open it fast.
- I wrote a draft of Lilim in my journal using photos as prompts.
- I walked outside to try the camera. I realized that the power of the camera is just one element of good photography. There has to be good lighting too.
- Watched the story of a Filipino child laborer, which Kerwin shared.
- Watched Magic Mike.
