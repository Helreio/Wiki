I am grateful for:

1. The calmness and emotional maturity I have in facing this issue.
2. Papa texting me and asking how I am.
3. Realizing how much I want to do with my writing.

"I can express myself well."

Amazing

- I was finally able to talk to a DTI agent. The agent told me that the replacement warranty should've been 7 days.
- I felt better because I got the feeling that I did something about the situation. Plus, the sun was out in the morning and Lea was here.
- I finalized my complaint form plus evidences then sent it to DTI.
- Lea and I ate at Easywings.
- Lea and I met Kuya Ingko again selling salad.
- Rom came to our home to deliver. He thanked me for the Masterclass. I was glad he found it useful. He rode his bike under the rain.
- We went out with the gang and ate at Angelica Cafe. It was really fun. The ambiance was awesome.
- We walked from crossing to Claire and me back home.
