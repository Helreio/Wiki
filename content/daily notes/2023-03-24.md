## I am grateful for:
1. Finding a new angle to write the essay: walking liminalities.
2. The many opportunities to connect with artists here in LB in the coming days.
3. My freedom, but also my recent listenings and how they are moving me to care more about others.

## Affirmation

"Everything is interconnected."

## Review

I continued working on [[Entry to ANWW20]]. I rewrote the introduction.

Continued watching Making a Murderer at lunch.

Continued writing. I wrote portions of my life as a JW. I researched more on autoethnography.

I walked.

Continued watching Cobra Kai.
