## I am grateful for:
1. The reminder yesterday that, while writing and sharing is important in my life work, it shouldn't be the most important preoccupation.
2. The exciting opportunity to find a hero to study.
3. My money arriving yesterday.

## Affirmation

"I am an artist of life first."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

Wrote these notes:
- [[What we didn't experience also make us interesting]]
- [[We are incapacitated by our lack of experiences]]
- [[Writers who influenced Mary Oliver]]
- [[A few things everyone can humbly try to hold onto — Fitzgerald]]
- [[Benefits of re-reading]]

I browsed through the website of [James C. Klagge](http://jamesklagge.net/). I saw some interesting materials on Wittgenstein, specifically his work on the relationship of a philosopher's biography and his philosophy. I reviewed the note on how poetry and narrative shows the reader how they could reenact it.

I started reviewing [[thoughts/edward mooney]]'s blog *Mists on the Rivers*, a blog where he writes about [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]], [[thoughts/ludwig wittgenstein]], [[thoughts/søren kierkegaard]], and [[Bashō]]. Ed mentions as blogging influences, [Catlin Lowe](https://catlinlowe.wordpress.com/) and [Kelly Dean Jolley](https://kellydeanjolley.com/). I included Kelly Dean Jolley in my potential influences to study. I started reading his blog and learned about his interesting relationship with Thoreau. The discussion in the blog's comments are also thought-provoking.

I started creating my philosphical family tree using diagrams.net.

I listened to a [podcast episode on Søren Kierkegaard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOytQOZOp9A) and watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9JCwkx558o) on him.
