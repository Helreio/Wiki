I am grateful for:

1. Getting out of that toxic relationship and being with someone I am able to successfully negotiate with.
2. My singlehood. While I surely want to be a father, I am grateful that I currently am not and I am able to enjoy focusing on the things I want to do.
3. Writing and research.

"I will give my full presence to the things I'll be doing today."

Amazing

- I journaled about doing research.
- I started reading a book about caring for Shih Tzu dogs for my Kako Health project.
- I translated [[Kaliskis na Ulap â€” Mga Salin#08-20-1851 Wala tayong wika upang ilarawan ang ating pagkatao]].
- Walked to UP to buy yogurt.
- Looked at trailers from Craig Mod's recent film review list to find what is worth watching.
- Watched Nobody (2021).
