## I am grateful for:
1. September 2022. For the lessons and experiences it brought me.
2. Being alive today and being in a relatively healthy state of body and mind. I am starting October 2022 well.
3. Yesterday's walk. For bringing me fruitful thoughts on how to move forward with my work.

## Affirmation

"I know what I want to do."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

After reviewing some diary entries, I finally wrote a note for [[Capitalism]].

I included [[Maggie Appleton]]'s definition of [[Digital gardening]] in that note's references.

### Writing

I started thinking about [[Publishing strategies for digital gardeners]]. I revisited [Maggie Appleton's Github repo](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) and reviewed the digital gardeners there to find a publishing strategy I can copy.

While researching, I read:
- [On Digital Streams, Campfires, and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) by Tom Critchlow
- [Building a Digital Garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) by Tom Critchlow

I looked around:
