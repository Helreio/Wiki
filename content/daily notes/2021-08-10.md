I am grateful for:

1. Lea being able to recognize the things I value the most and saying the right words.
2. Austin Kleon's interview yesterday. I was reminded of the principles behind show your work.
3. That contianer I bought at Ate Grace's.

"I show my work."

Amazing

- I journaled about how I can apply Austin Kleon's "Show Your Work" principle.
- I continued reading the article ok emotions.
- I processed a rich journal entry that got me thinking deeper about purpose.
- I translated [[Kaliskis na Ulap â€” Mga Salin#01-04-1860 Hindi tayo nito nabibihag]].
- I started watching the documentary Amazing Grace.
- I walked in UP while thinking more about purpose.
- I continued watching Money Heist.
- I translated a quote by Lord Sumption, which I also turned into a poem: [[Anong Klaseng Buhay]].
- I talked to Lea about my thoughts regarding purpose.
