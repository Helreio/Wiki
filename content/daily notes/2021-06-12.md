I am grateful for:

1. My happy friends. I have extremely extroverted and extremely introverted friends. What a delight!
2. This opportunity to really practice stoicism and all the other practices I have. CBT and meditation too.
3. That conversation with Lea about how we would face crises like these in the future and remembering the things we are more grateful for despite all of these.

"I can bounce back from losses. I can manage the stress needed to fight for what I think is right and to prevent future occurrences and improve how everyone of us treat each other."

Amazing

- I read the Consumer Act of the Philippines.
- I wrote a first draft of my DTI complaint form.
- I went to Mint + Snow for the first time and saw Diwa and Ju. I gave their box of crinkle tart and saw how excited Diwa was.
- Shared to Diwa and Ju that I am going through some blues right now. Felt a lot better to know about their own struggles.
- Went to Claire to bring her crinkle tart and learned about her families plight with the BIR, where they lost about 300k. This further showed how small my problem is compared to other people.
