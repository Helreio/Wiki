## I am grateful for:
1. The great time I had with JayVee and Goan last night. I am grateful that their presence brought color to my day and week and stay here in Sta. Maria. This time I spent with them is one of those things I really need, as often as possible.
2.  Amanda, for remembering me yesterday. I hope an arrangement with her mom will be reached. I think the opportunity will be a great experience.
3.  A great new day waiting for me.

## What will I do to make today great

1.  Actually, I feel like watching a game/games today. It's been a while since I invested my time in it. And I could possibly do some light reading in between.
2.  I will research the best service to accept donations online.
3.  I will continue studying logic.

## Affirmation

I am able to enjoy my stay here in Pangsinan. I have friends to meet. Things to do to keep me preoccupied. Parents. Dogs. Fields. Relatives. And opportunities to practice love and patience.

## What made today awesome

1.  I watched a full-length basketball game after quite some time.
2.  I learned how to use payoneer and patreon.
3.  It was a very ordinary day and that is why it's amazing.
