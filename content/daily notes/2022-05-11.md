## I am grateful for:
1. Being able to finish that 18000-step walk!
2. Discovering the Binhi Park yesterday, something I could visit one of these days.
3. Rissa for being so kind as to send the remaining ₱15.

## Affirmation

## Review
### Studies

Expanded notes on open loops. Edited a few poems and poetry prompts.

### Projects

**My Writing Project**

I journaled about still not seeing Edward Abbey's quest in Desert Solitaire. But I am also starting to ask myself about the nature of my quest. I know I want to answer the question "How to live?" but I am starting to probe deeper on the validity and excitement of the method to answer it: nature and walking.

I created the following narrative notes:
- [[vignettes/losing another dirt road]]
- [[vignettes/a morning at alog with tantan]]

### Others

- Tried watching Tragedy of Macbeth, but didn't understand old poetic English. Started watching Make Up.
- Had dinner with Lea at 2nd Floor Diner.
- Had Cad Choco ice cream.
- Rewatched Hunt for the Wilderpeople with Lea.
