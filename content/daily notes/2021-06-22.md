I am grateful for:

1. The opportunity to work.
2. The restful evening.
3. Being emotionally calm and stable.

"I am very, very resilient."

Amazing

- I learned that Tito Jun killed a snake. The third snake in one week.
- First time to have an order held so long in Scribendi.
- Started watching Unorthodox.
