## I am grateful for:
1. Once again, the power of pausing. I was able to avoid messaging mama about the issue. I need more time to process this. Now I know.
2. Realizing that family is a social construct and can get past the initial boundaries given to us.
3. This kid that is full of life and energy. I remember Tantan.

## Affirmation

"I am intent in building my own family and will eventually get past the sadness I may be feeling for the demise of my own."
