## I am grateful for:
1. The experience of buying new clothes through Lea's help, more importantly touching an unfamiliar side of me and feeling the desire to try out something new through clothing.
2. Reading Walden closely.
3. Articulating the approach I shall take in writing the book.

## Affirmation

"I am writing a book about Elbi."

Read Inscape by Amanda Juico Dela Cruz. Through it, exposed to the work of Agnes Arellano.

Watched Ted Lasso at lunch.

Washed dishes.

Installed Lea's new Macbook battery.

Asked Shopify to make a refund to Ili.

Underlords.

Started thinking about how to do the branding consultation with Maui.

Walked with Lea to ask for more advice.

Walked to Ela–Rambutan–Pili–Mondonedo–Royal Palm–Aglibut–Capinpin–Velasco

Had dinner with Lea.

Explored Mailerlite and seeing that I couldn't migrate to the new Mailerlite. Also learned that it is probably a bad idea to self-host a newsletter.

Browsed the branding strategy pdfs Lea sent me.

Prepared todos for tomorrow.
