## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing that that poor kitty has someone to take care of her.
2. The kindness of the poor that I have repeatedly witnessed.
3. This day. An opportunity to continue my work.

## Affirmation

"This day will be awesome."

## Review
### Studies

I journaled about my morning walk at a fishpond at Sta. Teresa.

### Writing

I continued reading A Pilgrim at Tinker Creek
I continued writing Lilim 03(04). I also edited the photos for it.

### Walking

Velasco-Narra-Royal Palm-Carabao Park

Foggy UP

### Projects

**Financial System Reevaluation**

I continued reading about semi-retirement as an alternative to FIRE. I am attracted to it because it is something I already do and it balances the present with the future. Since I am already doing it, all I need is to optimize my system a little bit.

### Others

I continued watching Sex Education Season 3.
Had merienda chat with Juwa at Homespun then walk a bit at UP.
Saw Kuya Kisig and Ate Angel walking into UP.
