## I am grateful for:
1. That walk and visit yesterday to market. I found a good squid deal but also just got in touch with a part of LB that I seldom see.
2. Jesa for helping me out with thinking about walking and throwing these ideas together.
3. This morning slowing down and allowing me to be myself.
