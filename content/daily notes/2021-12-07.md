I am grateful for:

1. Being completely alone now.
2. Slowly figuring out the morning routine that feels right to me.
3. These pants that arrived yesterday. I avoided wearing these for so long because they were hot. Who would have thought I will be able to use them at this critical time.

"I am frugal."

Amazing

- Continued my Talahardin improvement project.
- Listened to 70 over 70 interview with Andre de Shields
- Cooked adobo sa sprite.
- Continued watching Arcane.
- Sprayed Vet's Best on the office.
- Walked to UP.
- Lea asked lots of questions last night about my life work. It was amazing to articulate myself that way.
