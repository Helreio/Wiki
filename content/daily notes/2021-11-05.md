I am grateful for:

1. My life. The trajectory I've been through that brought me here.
2. A better sleep last night.
3. My mom for agreeing to cook customized food for Kako.

"I am rational. I know how to make good decisions based on reason and not emotion."

Amazing

- I journaled about my attempt to talk to Diwa about gender.
- I processed literature notes I gathered from Zettelkasten.de about reading.
- I went to Waltermart Calamba to buy pasalubong to my family in Pangasinan and to Lea's family.
- I went to Lea's house and spent the evening just browsing Lea's old photos, taking photos of the best ones, and asking questions to Tita so she can tell stories.
- Had dinner with Lea's family: afritada.
- Slept well at the sofa bed.
