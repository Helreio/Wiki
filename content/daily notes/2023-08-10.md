## I am grateful for:
1. Cari slowly getting back to her old self. She's still sleeping a lot but she can open her eyes widely now and she moves like her self.
2. These cats who have provided me and Lea company in this home while we tear ourselves from our families and create a new life together.
3. Jacky for doing a lot of hard work with getting Quartz 4 in place for many of us.

## Affirmation

"It's okay to remove people from my mental space, so I can use that space for the right people."
