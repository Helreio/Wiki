## I am grateful for:
1. Being able to write the first draft of Uman.
2. Seeing Shorty living a good life.
3. Having Lea around and Rem coming over later.

## Affirmation

"I will be able to finish the essay today brilliantly."

## Field notes

## Review
### Studies

I journaled about how I can make my walks more fulfilling moving forward. If I want to practice writing descriptions of nature, then I need to spend more time there.

I continued writing Uman April 2022. I am happy with how it is progressing particularly at the beginning.

### Projects

**Lea's finances**

Assisted Lea in conducting her monthly financial review.

### Others

- Continued watching Ozark.
- Bought Kobo Libra 2.
- Rem arrived and we started talking about:
	- His issues with Tungko.
	- His vision on what leadership in Tungko should look like.
- We had dinner at Pancitan, while I listened to him talk about "spiritual technologies". I learned that he doesn't talk about this a lot to others and that he feels comfortable sharing it to me. This deepened my empathy to him.
- We walked around UP and sat for about 15 minutes at Freedom Park while talking. I could do this someday, just watching the stars.
- We bought hot drinks and toast and continued our conversation at home.
