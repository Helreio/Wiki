## Review

### Studies

### Projects

**My Writing Life**

I continued reading DIY MFA.

I finalized Lilim 3(3) and scheduled it for Sunday.

I shared my essay on Craig Mod's effect on my work and this led to some new followers on IG as well as two new subscribers on the blog.

### Others

- Lea and I had lunch at Spice Jar for only the second time. We ordered Tortizza original taco beef flavor and buffalo wings.
- Lea cooked chicken wrap and we ate it for dinner
