## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing how Rio and Mac love their kids so much, and how the kids really adore their parents.
2. Receiving a good news last night: I got my first writing fellowship!
3. Walking with Lea from SM San Pablo to the jeep terminal and enjoying the walk with her.

## Affirmation

"I am being led to the right path."

## Review

I worked on improving my [[Sky level]], specifically my [[My LMS sky level setup]].

Lea and I had lunch while watching TKM.

I played Underlords.

I modified [[My life goals master list]] to reflect changes in my priorities and my desire to return to working on my writing projects alongside trying to find a source of income and other projects.

I played Underlords.

Lea and I walked to buy food. Then I continued walking to Velasco–Capinpin–Sandoval–Narra–Juliano–Pancho–Viado–Roxas–Pili–Aglibut–Roayl Palm.

Lea and I had dinner while watching TKM.

I updated my Quartz and played around changing the font.

I played Underlords.

I summarized Chapter 4 of [[thoughts/diy mfa by pereira]].

Prepared for bed then slept.
