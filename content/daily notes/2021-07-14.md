I am grateful for:

1. This soft bed where I am sitting right now.
2. Being able to practice temperance a while ago when the neighbor's dog was noisy.
3. This free day.

"I am capable of being the best version of myself."

Amazing

- I continued watching Finding Your Voice
- Brough Shorty to the vet.
- I continued watching Kingdom.
- I walked to Laguna bay.
- I took a binaural video of the lake.
- I discovered Roman Krznaric's How Should I Live?
