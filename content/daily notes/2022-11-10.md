## I am grateful for:
1. The two last orders for this last working day of this stretch.
2. Seeing Chewy yesterday!
3. The call to experience Ginhawa more.

## Affirmation

"I feel good. I nourish my body and mind so I can feel good more."

## Review

Continued working for Scribendi.

Watched Derry Girls while having lunch.

After working, Lea and I had a siesta. Then we walked to Robinson's to buy groceries. We then had merienda/dinner at RACA. I walked to buy catfood, fed the street cats, then went home.

At home, I cleaned the Macbooks, reinstalled Freedom, reconciled YNAB, responded to my messages, then researched how to make Parallels desktop faster.

I played ML before sleeping. I needed two more stars before I reach Legend.
