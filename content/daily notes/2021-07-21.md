I am grateful for:

1. Burning. Such a visually rich and interesting film (with great acting!).
2. The centering walk I had yesterday. I feel like I know more about how things are interconnected in my life. I mean, I think I have articulated this in the past. But now it is clearer.
3. Thoreau. For showing how I can do my work and live my life better.

"I live a rich and resilient inner life."
