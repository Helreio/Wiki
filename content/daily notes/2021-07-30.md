I am grateful for:

1. A wonderful time spent with my parents via call. It seems like we talk better from a far haha.
2. Seeing Kako and she recognized my voice! So cute! I miss her.
3. Lea's treat and her maturity. Our relationship in general.

"I have great parents!"

- Finished Scribendi work.
- I finished watching the Vice JW documentary.
