## I am grateful for:
1. The mildly cold comforting wind that came yesterday and this morning in my walks. They make me feel good and present. Walking is easier and more pleasant.
2. Yesterday's exercise on going back to the things I did in the past and identifying the peak moments.

## Affirmation

## Review

In my journal, I wrote some common threads I noticed in my list of activities in my good time journal so far.

I created the following notes:
- [[AEIOU method per Patnaik]]
- [[Mind mapping]]

I continued writing down activities in [[private/my good time journal]].

Lea and I continued watching Ancient Apocalypse while eating lunch.

I got approved as a Course Hero tutor.

I cleaned the electric fans while listening to a book summary of DYL.

While having merienda, I read the fifth issue of TTT by Craig Mod.

Lea joined me for a walk. We walked at Data—Ruby—Velasco—Aglibut—Capinpin—Sandoval—Narra—Juliano (where we saw Bevs and Embi)—Royal Palm—Mondenedo—Madamba—Viado—Roxas. We then sat in front of the Carillon before going to Savemore to buy stuff then going home.

We had dinner while watching The Crown episode about the Fayed family.

I did a mind map around the topic of "creating stories."
