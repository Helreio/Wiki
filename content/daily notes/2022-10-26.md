## Review

I spent my morning writing a speech for Rem, which detailed our last memory together as a jump off point to saying three things I wanted to tell him if he was alive.

Lea, me, Diwa, Ju, and Bevs travelled together to the chapel at Sto. Tomas where Rem's remains were held. When I arrived, I saw Benjie, Ka-Iktoy, and Jace. I introduced myself to the two latter and talked to Benjie a little. I then went inside to talk to Alvin and Chave. Alvin shared how they discovered Rem's death and Chave shared how they arrived to the decision to cremate Rem. I cried on Claire's shoulders. She told me we are only the one's in grief, while Rem is now happy in the spirit world. I approached Tita Cora and cried on her shoulder with Lea beside me.

I helped in managing the euology. I delievered my speech to Rem.

I talked with Jan Bautista after the eulogy.

We rode with Ome back to LB. We dropped by 7 eleven first for pagpag before going home.
