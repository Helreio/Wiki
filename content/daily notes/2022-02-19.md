# 2022.02.19

I am grateful for:

1. Just being here at the province. Sitting in front of an abandoned field.
2. The peace that I have within, despite everything happening around me.
3. Going through the vaccination process without any short-term adverse effects.

"I am ready to go back to contemplation again."

# Review

## Studies

I had a very long and satisfying journaling session at the field. I wrote about ideas on how to be more effective in my contemplative work.

## Projects

### VinceImbat.com

I learned how to add Google Analytics in my site.

I tried installing Netlify CMS that supports page bundles, but realized it was too complex.

I went backt to considering using Obsidian and even read an article about the plaintext life ([http://www.markwk.com/plain-text-life.html](http://www.markwk.com/plain-text-life.html)). But then, Zuolan responded to my query and provided a solution, which finally made external wikilinks work.

## Others

Migs and I had dinner at the Binmaley bay walk. We had pizza, vigan empanada, and milktea.

We spent some time at Bo's Coffee, sitting down near the water.

Caught up with Raymond and heard about the things he went through last year (i.e., his baby dying).

Caught up with Megs, Bobet, and Cams.
