## I am grateful for:
1. Just sitting here by myself (well with Poppy around) taking the time to reconnect with all the good things.
2. Moving well with writing the literature review and learning new things.
3. This calm, quiet morning.

## Affirmation

"I live in the present moment."

## Review

I finished SEP 254.

I reconnected with Lia.

I found a job at Masungi Georeserve and fantasized about it.

I played Underlords.
