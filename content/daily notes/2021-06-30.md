I am grateful for:

1. The trail at IRRI. For the first time in six months of stayin in LB, I found a place in nature I can go to if I want to listen to myself and contemplate.
2. Finding Finding Your Voice.
3. The life I created for myself here in LB. A more creative, calm, community-filled life.

"I am so blessed. I have improved my life profoundly. Whatevere happens next I am in a so much better place. I do not feel alone."

Amazing
