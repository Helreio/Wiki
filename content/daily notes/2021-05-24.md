I am grateful for:

1. Seeing Vec and Rica this morning; it will be a start of a rekindling of friendships.
2. Enjoying good times with friends yesterday.
3. Being with Lea.

"I am around people I care about."

Amazing

- Saw Vec and Rica after buying pandesal at Yigo's.
- Finished three scribendi orders.
- Tasted ginataang papaya by Lea.
