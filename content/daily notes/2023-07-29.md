## I am grateful for:
1. This feeling that the revisions for Chapters 1 and 2 of Krys' paper will be a bit easier and that the leg work will happen more on Chapter 4.
2. Getting clearer and clearer on how I could execute the kind of philosophical work I want to do.
3. This idea: affect and action could precede theory.

## Affirmation

"I am a philosopher."
