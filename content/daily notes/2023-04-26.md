## I am grateful for:
1. Walking and talking with Ju.
2. Walking and talking with Yano.
3. Listening to all the feedback and experiences of everyone who walked.

## Affirmation

"I live a beautiful vibrant life."

## Review

Woke up at 5:15 am to prepare for the walk.

NLAI workshop started around 6:20 am and ended around 9:30 am.

I made a new friend in Wenz.

I had lunch by myself while watching Peaky Blinders.

I finished fixing TLW in the website and started fixing Lilim.

I play Underlords.

I went to Claire's workshop. I met new friends there, like Gian.

I had dinner with Yano, Maui, Louise Far, Charmaine, and Claire at Danielito's. I regret not going to Louise's workshop. Her story was really inspiring, and she likes to chat and asks questions.

I played Underlords.
