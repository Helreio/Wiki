I am grateful for:

1. Last night's conversation with Lea. It convinced me more on uncovering the general principles of living and teaching that instead of strategies and structure.
2. Finally finishing my monthly review and seeing exactly what I will be working on.
3. The silence in the past few nights. The neighbors dogs are not making noises.

"I am able to follow through with my intentions."
