## I am grateful for:
1. Preventing myself from sending that message to Lea last night and saying them in person instead. This led to a better and more constructivrle conversation.
2. Being able to help a friend apply for a job.
3. A good, calm state of mind I have this morning.

## Affirmation

"I live now. And that is everything."
