I am grateful for:

1. Discovering Craft. I think I found my match.
2. Being able to stand up on my own. The courage that I had all those years of choosing a lonelier path, a different path, a path truer to who I am, a path where I can listen to myself.
3. This day. I am alive. I am here. I am changing. Tomorrow I will be a different person. Not totally different, but expanded, stretched, grown.

To do:

- [x] Morning routine
- [x] Start packing

“I can be assertive in a respectful way.”

Amazing

- I was able to transfer my notes to Craft and create my own Evernote-like hierarchy.
- Finished packing my things.
- Had lunch with my parents (lechon manok and veggies).
- Made a one last connection to the nature scene in Pangasinan.
- Had a farewell photo with kako and Doji.
- Had a dinner with Mama.
- First time to see some parts of Pangasinan that I may have seen before but already forgotten (Asingan, Tayug, etc.)
- Talked with Alfred about a lot of things and got to know more about what happened to people like him during the pandemic.
