## I am grateful for:
1. The people who signed up for the workshop.
2. This free day. An opportunity to move my own projects.
3. Yano and all the young ones who joined us yesterday.

## Affirmation

"I am compassion walking."

## Review

We watched TKM at Lunch.

Continued preparing for the NLAI walk by finding a poem about walking with a friend. I found [Sabay na tayo by inggo](https://hellopoetry.com/poem/1551225/sabay-na-tayo/).

Lea and I simulated the walk together.

I had dinner while watching Peaky Blinders.
