I am grateful for:

1. Being able to share about my Talakahon for the very first time to my small circle. Doing this, however, made me realize I need to create more one-on-one connections with my ideal people, people who I resonate more with, with values I share more. Spending time with people different to me has been instructive. But I have really neglected conversing with people who think like I do.
2. Discovering that book yesterday: Be the Gateway.
3. Arriving with the insight on approaching sharing cautiously.
