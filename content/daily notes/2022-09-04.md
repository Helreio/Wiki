## I am grateful for:
1. Today, for the opportunity to spend time with friends and travel.
2. Poppy for starting to feel at home.
3. The privilege to write about last month's learnings.

## Affirmation

"I am an understanding live-in partner."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I wrote about my observations of LB starting to get crowded with students. After arriving from the day's trip and getting into that difficult conversation with Lea, I meditated then journaled, which inspired the note: [[Holding on to the past can prevent us from being present]].

I also wrote the following notes:
- [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-09-07-12]]
- [[Religion vs spirituality]]

### Writing
- I finalized [[uman/008]] and published it.

### Photography

### Walking

### Projects

### Others

- Bonded with the Balitbitan kids at Pagsanjan
