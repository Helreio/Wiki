I am grateful for:

1. The sun. It showed up today. I hope it continues to show up. I need the heat and the bright lights.
2. These practices. I am predisposed to melancholia. But these tiny habits help me be more grounded. They give me a chance in being happier.
3. About of week of discipline in terms of not eating sugar.

To do

- [x] Continue Scribendi (try to finish everything).
- [ ] Walk and buy cat food later.

“I am going to be happier.”

Amazing

- I was able to express my skepticism of Hoponopono once more, but I was also able to express what I see is the parallelism of it with other things I know.
- Walked to Pili Drive then to Aina.
- Bought goods at Aina.
