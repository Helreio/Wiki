## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing Juwa last night and having a chat over brownies.
2. Nailing down the outline for the essay. All I need to do is write it down.
3. The opportunity to be around friends later.

## Affirmation

"I will write the essay in time and have an entry by April 1."

## Review

I reviewed my translation of A House Called Tomorrow by Alberto Rios: [[translations/isang tahanang tatawagin nating bukas]].

I continued working on the [[Entry to ANWW20]].

While having lunch, Lea and I started watching The Kominsky Method.

By 4 pm, Lea and I walked to Sining Makiling Gallery at Umali Hall to attend the opening of Maui's first Solo Exhibit.

After going home, I ate some more kakanin while writing more content for the ANWW20 entry.

Then I played some Underlords and slept.
