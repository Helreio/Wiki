## I am grateful for:
1. The cold mornings. A balancing effect against the heat that is beginning to encroach all of us.
2.  Having Kessy in my life. An ear willing to listen. A friend I know is there for me.
3.  The quiet. The silence. And the soundscape that fills it up.

## What will I do to make today great

1.  I will create the Support Page.
2.  I will continue studying logic.
3.  I will meet Kessy.

## Affirmation

I am deserving of true love

## What made today awesome

1.  I was able to help solve a problem by talking with the people around me and resolving our common problem.
2.  I was able to practice or tell some of the things that I know from reading with my conversation with Jayvee and Goan.
3.  I was able to write my Support Page and was able to finish summarizing semantics and started on the exercises.
