I am grateful for:

1. Being prompted to think more about the signal I provide to people in terms of the work I do. Vec’s invitation is tempting. The prestige that comes from being a lecturer in UP is interesting. But the job will take time away from what I want to do: my art, my mission, my research. What happened prompted me to really think about what I do and how I communicate it.
2. Finally being able to do my laundry.
3. My first week in LB. It was filled with surprises, good food, love, and things to think about.

To do:

- [x] Finish annual review workshop
- [ ] Continue annual review
- [x] Buy other household needs
- [ ] Walk at UP

“I am an independent artist.”
