I am grateful for:

1. Reading these wonderful writings: Timothy Willamson, Nan Shepard, Teju Cole, and Alex Michaelides.
2. Hearing that everyone is doing okay in Pangasinan.
3. Sarah's kind words and trust.

"I am a careful friend."

Amazing

- Invested 70k to the eToro portfolio.
- Saw Diwa in person for the first time since our little glitch.
- Went out to get the beans from Claire. The ending was the entire gang except Ju eating at a diner.
- Told the story about the flower delivery.
- Had a convo with Rem about poetry.
