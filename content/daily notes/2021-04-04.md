I am grateful for:

1. Coming to the realization that I haven’t truly given writing the true dedication that I said I will give it. Now, I know that if I want to change people’s lives through my writing, I really need to take the craft seriously.
2. Joyce Maynard for the reminder to start small and start with one personal essay and learn from that.
3. Sustaining a daily meditation practice for 40 consecutive days.

“I am a dedicated writer.”

Amazing

- Walked to Grove then Balitbitan.
- I recalibrated my notes about my daily routine and note-writing practice.
- Watched Homeland.

- Lea read one of her maharot essays to me.
