I am grateful for:

1. Every little thing I encounter in this life.
2. Every single moment I am alive.
3. Every single experience I have every moment that I am alive.

To do:

"I am a savorer of moments. I don't have other grand purpose other than that. To raise the quality if the day, that is the greatest of all arts."

Amazing

- I woke up by 6 am to continue my Scribendi assingment.
- I slowly bite into my quota for this month.
- Allowed Lea to lead her AC this morning.
- Went out to buy lunch: Sinampalocang manok and chicken pastel
- Had meryenda while watching Soul, a very beautiful movie
- Soul reminded me of what truly matters: the little moments in life (we are already swimming in the ocean; living this life, savoring it is our purpose)
- Walked at UP towards Jamboree road
- Bought groceries and dinner (fried chicken and cucumber)
- Watched The secrets of the saqqara tomb while having dinner

Tommorrow
