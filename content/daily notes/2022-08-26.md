## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I continued reading the Inward Morning and wrote [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-08-30]].

I wrote the note: [[Reverence does not have to lead to worship]]

I explored [[andrew j. brown]]'s works
- [Henry Bugbee - an atheistic mysticism free of mythological trappings](http://andrewjbrown.blogspot.com/2014/06/henry-bugbee-atheistic-mysticism-free.html?m=1)
- [About](https://andrewjbrown.blogspot.com/p/about-this-blog.html)
- I was exposed to [[thoughts/unitarianism]] through him.
- I also learned about [[Benedict Spinoza]].
- I really liked the quote he uses in his website: [[Footprints not blueprints â€” Fingarette]]
- I also started reading [The Freedom To Be Tomorrow What We Are Not Today](https://andrewjbrown.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-freedom-to-be-tomorrow-what-we-are.html)

I availed my Amazon giftcard from my karma points accumulated from three years of working in Scribendi, and used it to buy Wilderness and the Heart, but failed.

### Writing

### Photography

### Walking
- I walked with Lea and we talked about belonging and how to start a community and whether to start one through an organizational or a personal brand.

### Projects

[[projects someday/community]]
- Continued reviewing Belong.

### Others
- I helped Lea prepare for her upcoming hosting event.
- Lea and I watched Mythic Quest.
