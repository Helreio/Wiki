## I am grateful for:
1. Walking with Lea this morning and having our lunch ready.
2. Feeling better now, less groggy.
3. The challenge to make all of these work for Lea and I.

## Affirmation

"Don't worry. Take action."

## Review

Continued writing Candent's marketing strategy.

Sent an email to Craig Mod telling him about my essay where I cited him.

I was looking for a way to geotag my notes and discovered: [Location Data and Geotagging in Apple Notes with Shortcuts | Jeremy Bassetti - Writer, Photographer, & Drifter](https://jeremybassetti.com/fieldnotes/gps-apple-shortcut/).

Watched Elise with Lea.
