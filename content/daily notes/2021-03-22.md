I am grateful for:

1. My introversion, my social anxiety, my OCD. They teach me my tendencies, my problems. They tune me inside to get to know myself better and work myself out.
2. Susan Cain for going outside her comfort zone and delivering that talk. Because of it, she has inspired many.
3. The hard work of being a human being.
