## Review

Woke up early to bring Lea to the bus to Cubao.

Walked a bit around Dagupan.

Went home to Cablong: met Kitkat and saw Kako and the other dogs as well as my family.

Chatted a bit with Mama.

Had lunch with Aldrich and Jake and my family.

Finished listening to the Ili interview and taking notes.

Walked to and from my favorite route around here while processing some tough emotions about Claire.

Dinner with family.
