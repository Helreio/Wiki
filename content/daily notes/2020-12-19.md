## I am grateful for:
1. Lea's surprise. It was really a surprise - a funny surprise that will make a good story.
2. Via. She is growing very fast and I haven't been with her enough, only through photos and videos. But I'm glad our little princess is growing well.
3. This new day. I'm excited to get hold of it.

## Affirmation
"I am a responsible pet owner."
