Amazing

- I woke up earlier and walked alongside the beach. I took some photos of fishermen and just watched the environment.
- Lea and I saw the other unit in Soulful bliss. We cooked our food there.
- We are our last breakfast for now and packed up our things.
- We had our last hour of swim. We got back in the house almost exactly an hour! Amazing.
- We said our goodbyes to Ate Betty and the dogs and went to Dagupan.
- Giorgio's is close. Angel's pizza has no dine in. We ended up eating at R&B cafe.
- We ordered two angel's pizzas.
- We traveled to Cablong.
- Lea finally met my parents. Papa talked to her well. Mama eventually. Bernice, surprisingly, had some good convos with her.
- I rode my bike.
- Had dinner with Lea. Tinolang manok, inihaw na bangus, and buro. She like the buro so much! Haha.
- Slept with Chikako.
