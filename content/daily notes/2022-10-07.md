## I am grateful for:
1. Learning more about Kierkegaard.
2. Reading Mooney's beautiful blog.
3. Feeling more motivated in my philosophical practice because of the weekly newsletter.

## Affirmation

"I am a philosopher."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about how [[Translation facilitates understanding]], what following the footprints of my heroes entail, Edward Mooney, and my philosophical family tree.

I transferred my literature notes of [[What is lyric philosophy - Heiti]] into the forest garden.

I read [Sympathy with Intelligence](https://edmooneyblog.wordpress.com/2012/05/09/sympathy-with-intelligence/).

I started reading [[thoughts/living philosophy by edward mooney]] and taking notes. I found Perlego.

### Writing

I further developed [[poems/never-ending - a poem for gyra]] then shared it with a photo on IG and FB.

### Photography

### Walking
- Walked to Lantican—Pancho—Juliano—Royal Palm—Carabao Park

### Projects

**Reading inbox**

- Watched Private Life with Lea.
