I am grateful for:

1. That beautiful and recentering walk yesterday afternoon.
2. My conversation with Lea which kinda synthesized what I learned in the past few days.
3. My fruitful study session yesterday.

"I am a researcher. I research philosophical underpinnings of a life management system."

Amazing

- Journaled an entire initial outline for the workshop.
- Took literature notes on Steve Patterson's "Coming Around Platonism".
- Took an evening walk to sagor and back using carusocan road.
- Rem reported how he use zettelkasten.
