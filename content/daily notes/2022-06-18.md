## Review
### Studies

### Writing

I transferred my writings on walking in my diary into Lilim 03(05) and edited it for flow.

### Photography

I started my meta-learning project for photography.

Started editing photos for Lilim 03(05) by just using intuition.

I searched for some popular photography forums and tried looking around at Digital Photography Review. I was searching for resources or ways to learn photo theory. Not much there.

I then went to browse blogs. Blogs are less systematic. They're more like a list of tips and tricks.

Since I wanted a more systemtic approach, I then looked at syllabuses. Harvard's intro to digital photography syllabus was great. I coupled it with Canon Snapshot tutorials. Then I saw the Photography Masterclass: A Complete Guide to Photography at Udemy.

### Projects

### Others

- My water meter got broken and I had to report it to LARC. No water until Monday.
- Continued watching Peaky Blinders.
- Renewed my SMAC at SM Calamba.
- Walked from SM Calamba to City Mall to ride tricy. It was raining and traffic was terrible.
- Started watching Everything, Everything.
