## Studies

Because I had some time to read while waiting for my ride back home, I started diving into some articles in my Pocket. I know I shouldn’t be reading theoretical articles on my phone, but I did it because I am noting highlights anyway. Perhaps this is a middleground between reading everything on my phone whenever I want to vs reading solely on my computer. I could read on my phone as long as it is just the first level of reading and I am reading it incrementally, meaning I will come back to it soon. The challenge though is coming back to it soon.

I read Tiago Forte’s article on Twyla Tharp ([https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-box-twyla-tharp-on-project-based-organizing/](https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-box-twyla-tharp-on-project-based-organizing/)). The other things I read were Craig Mod’s writings, which were not theoretical and apt for reading through my phone.

## Projects

### Web Design

I just tried looking for a CMS for static site generators and viola! I found one! Actually, several. I found Hokus CMS for Hugo, which was subpar. But what I really dove into and created an account with is Publii. I spent a considerable amount of my time exploring it. It has a desktop client, which I can use to work offline. This capability really makes me feel like working with a static site generator like when I was trying to learn Hugo and I did everything offline first. Publii is built on Electron though, the same language used to build Notion, which Andy Matuschak dislike (I dont know why, perhaps because to much <div>?). But there are many others. Netlify, the site that hosts my site has its own CMS. There are a few more others like Siteleaf, DatoCMS, Forestry, and jocms ([https://www.maketecheasier.com/best-static-website-cms/](https://www.maketecheasier.com/best-static-website-cms/)), but they are web applications that are quite expensive.

Speaking of Netlify, I learned how to use it too.

### Laptop

I read a few things about planned obsolesence. I watched this video on YouTube, a short one from a group that sued Apple for planned obsolesence ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTNzMYC51mc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTNzMYC51mc))

## Others

Lea gifted me with a bluetooth speaker.

Jacob (i.e., Lea) gifted me with mouth and neck covers and led light strips.

Received my first Bahrain t-shirt from Tita Remy.

We watched the Sonic underground movie.

I went home through a jeep bound to Sta. Cruz. I expressed my slight annoyance with Lea about it.
