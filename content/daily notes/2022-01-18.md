I am grateful for:

1. Finally getting my first dose. This brings me lots of hope. In just a month, I could go home to Pangasinan if I want to as early as Feb 15 of there is an available ride.
2. Being free from any adverse reactions from the vaccine.
3. Finally launching KNU.

# Review

## Studies

I continued reading APOW Chapter 14.

## Projects

### Thoreau website

I made a temporary logo for the site using Canva. I experimented with different sizes and resolution. I realized how little I know about creating a logo esp its technicalities.

I finally shared the website to Facebook, to the world.

## Others

I finished Master of None Season 2.

I walked at Jamboree road but I used the path to the campsite.

I ate at Tyo Guiâ€™s lomi again.
