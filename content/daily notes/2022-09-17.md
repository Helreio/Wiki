## I am grateful for:
1. Reaching three years with Lea.
2. Everything I learned about relationships from the past three years.
3. Meeting with Care last night and being reminded of how much I need to take care of my body.

## Affirmation

"I am in a happy and nurturing relationship."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about my morning walk with Lea and my headache.

Continued reading The Gift. Wrote [[Ways that artists can sustain their art in a market economy]].

I started listening to [Lewis Hyde's lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk2JVP-HKI8&t=1651s).
