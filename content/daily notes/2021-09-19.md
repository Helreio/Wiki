I am grateful for:

1. Lea's love and care and thoughtfulness.
2. Being alive today and having the ability to go to a trip.
3. The realization that I have to build my own terms of art.

"I am loved."

Amazing

- Travelled to Lipa proper after many years since the Tagisan ng Talino in 4th year.
- Went to Lemery beach.
- Road a boat first time since pandemic.
- Swam in the beach long since damaging my eardrum.
