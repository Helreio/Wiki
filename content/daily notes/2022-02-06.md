I am grateful for:

1. The sacrifices that Tita Remy made to prepare for my birthday.
2. Kris Ann's banana cake.
3. Everything that Lea did to make my party wonderful.

"I am loved."

## Studies

I finished reading Thich Nhat Hanh’s extended biography.

Processed highlights in APOW Chapters 18 and 19. The notes generated were particularly about strolls, their nature, and some reflections on how I am already able to use them in my routine.

I watched CM’s live stream then asked a question about whether he would advise a beginner to launch a membership program. He said that one should have try at least one year of doing pop-up newsletters with a begining and a clear end then reassess whether that feels right before committing to building memberships.

Played 7 Wonders with Kris Ann and Jhosa.

Walked with Lea to plaza with Jacob tagging along on his bike.

Watched 6 Underground.
