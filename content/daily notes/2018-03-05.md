## I am grateful for:
1. Just being home. The birds, the wind, the fields, the large enough space, the dogs. It's terrible here when I get bored and the neighbours are inconsiderate. But moments like these, when everything is perfect, I am very grateful of this place.
2.  All these knowledge waiting for me to devour.
3.  The time and space to write, to read, to be present in my mission.

## What will I do to make today great

1.  Rewrite the About Page and link to a support me page.
2.  Study logic.
3.  Maintain peace all the time.

## Affirmation

I am capable of executing my plans to make the most of my stay here in Pangasinan. I am capable of coping if neighbour behaviors are tolerable and I have action plans to take when they are no longer tolerable. I am able to maintain internal and external peace.

## What made today awesome

1.  I was able to work clearly again in the morning because I didn't have breakfast. I was able to rewrite the Home Page and the About Page.    
2.  I walked on my favorite bike route after more than a week. I didn't see Lulu though. I miss her already.
3.  The day was almost perfect especially in the late afternoon. It's a blessing: neighbors didn't burn their garbages today.
