I am grateful for:

1. My date with Lea yesterday. It's weird that I had a really good time even if I wrote all those stuff on my journal.
2. Being able to record that tutorial on editing.
3. Cutting my food intake last night to respond to my hunger and my desire to eat healthier (1 bread, 1 egg, 1 bell pepper)

"I am capable of living a happy life."

Amazing

- I started watching Craig Mod's livestream of his building the Ise-ji site.
- I started being interested in learning web development.
- I published Lilim 5.
- Diwa reprimanded me about publishing Sarahâ€™s story without letting them know. This led me to think about the repurcussions of my actions and dealt with emotional ebbs and flow of what happened.
- I read [The Virtue of Being Wrong](https://medium.com/stoicism-philosophy-as-a-way-of-life/the-virtue-of-being-wrong-b115ed39d439)
