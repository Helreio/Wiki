## I am grateful for:

1. Lea's overnight oats. They taste really good.
2. Having Lea around the past two days. I felt really good just being with her.
3. The results of my health test. I now know that my efforts to manage my blood sugar is successful and that I just had to watch my cholesterol.

## Affirmations

## Review

### Others

- Went to Generika with Lea to get the results of our tests. My sugar is normal but my cholesterol is borderline as well as my uric acid. I also started antibiotics.
