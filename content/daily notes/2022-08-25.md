## I am grateful for:
1. Understanding what Bugbee meant by certainty.
2. A great sleep due to taking melatonin.
3. Another opportunity to work on the life that I want for myself.

## Affirmation

"I am a devoted partner."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

- Continued reading The Inward Morning and wrote [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-08-29]]. While making sense of his entry, I learned about the [[unmoved mover]] by Aristotle.
- I also processed yesterday's seeds and came up with [[thoughts/difficult experiences spur us to rely on experiential knowledge]].

### Writing

### Photography

### Walking

### Projects

[[projects someday/community]]
- I continued reading Belong and improved my three columns and wrote a step-by-step guide for doing [[The Energy Axis]] exercise.

### Others

- Attended Uwa's tea meditation and bonded with my friends.
