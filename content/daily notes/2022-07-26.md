## I am grateful for:
1. Mary Oliver's admonition: "You do not have to be good... You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves."
2. My afternoon walk with Lea yesterday. It was fun not to be alone in my walks for once.
3. Henry Bugbee's articulation of the present moment and how to attend with it and its effect on my own articulation of my purpose.

## Affirmation

"I have found my quest."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I journaled about a new version of my purpose's articulation, which seems to recircle back to the purpose I set for myself back in Tanaw days: [[thoughts/my purpose is to live deliberately]].

I processed my diary entry on my thoughts about Bugbee and produced the following notes:
- [[The day as a context for one's work]]
- [[The philosophical method of Henry Bugbee]]
- [[thoughts/henry bugbee]]

I also re-read my highlights from Wittgenstein's Artillery and wrote the following notes:
- [[Poetry and narrative trace their history so readers can re-enact them]]
- [[Philosophy and poetry can be complementary]]

Started reading a new chapter in Edward Mooney's Lost Intimacy in American Thought (Chapter 6) "Two Testimonies in American Philosophy"

### Writing

I started improving my Filipino translations of TLTD poems to be sent before August 8.
