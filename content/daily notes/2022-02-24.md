I am grateful for:

1. One week of stay here in Pangasinan - being with family, trying out new food places, listening to the struggles of my friends.
2. This beautiful morning - a reminder of the beauty possible when I wake up early in the morning.
3. The restraint I have been putting on myself since Monday.

"I can help others while still honoring my boundaries."
