I am grateful for:

1. All the people throughout the world fighting for liberty.
2. Being relatively healthy right now - over two years since the pandemic.
3. The kindness among human beings.

"I am free."

Amazing:

- I journaled about my current heuristic on the vaccine issue.
- I started focusing on the vaccine issue itself.
- I started watching the Doctors for Covid Ethics symposium and learned about the real origin of the virus.
- Started my Weekly Review.
- Finalized my presentation on Mind Like Water.
- Great Fruit Salad seasion on Mind Like Water. Addressed questions.
