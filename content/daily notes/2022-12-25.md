## I am grateful for:
1. A surprisingly absorbing game of betrayal last night with Lea.
2. The tasty hot chocolate drink I drank at Taza Mia yesterday.
3. An opportunity to write one final newsletter before the end of the year.

## Affirmation

"I can build a life that I love."

## Review

I journaled about my initial ideas for [[A book about Los Ba√±os]].

I re-read [The 'Rules' of Walking](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/134/) by Craig Mod.

I created the note: [[the courage to eliminate - clear]]

Lea and I just talked about Sahara Rose's book while having lunch.

I tried playing Leomord in ML.

I tried writing a final TLW issue but felt it didn't feel right, so I stopped.

Lea and I walked at Pili Drive and continued talking about stuff. We had dinner at Dimsum Panda (cheap fried siomai and fried rice). Then we had milk tea at Serendipity Tea.

When we got home, we watched Del Toro's Pinnochio.
