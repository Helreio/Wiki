## I am grateful for:
1. Going to Enchanted Kingdom with Lea.
2. Going out of my comfort zone and being in touch with a long range of emotions. I didn't know I have a fear of heights until I was at the ferris wheel!
3. Seeing Claire step up and reconnecting with her.

## Affirmation

"I am brave."

## Review

I started working on SEP 257.

While having lunch, Lea and I watched Never Have I Ever.

After lunch, I continued working on SEP 257 and finished it.

I then worked on the needed revisions for the Inclusion paper, while having merienda.

I played Underlords then did one round of reading for the paper before sending it to Krys with minor modifications.

I then went to a walk.

I had dinner while watching Cobra Kai then played some more Underlords.
