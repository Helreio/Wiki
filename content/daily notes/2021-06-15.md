I am grateful for:

1. Doing a second call with a DTI representative and getting a much-needed advice on how to move forward.
2. The sun. It keeps on showing up again. But it isn't as hot as before.
3. The freedom I have to do what I want to do today. I know I don't always make the best use of it. But I'll keep on trying.

"I am an artist. I do art everyday."

Amazing

- I called DTI for a second time and they advised me to send my email to two more addresses.
- Wrote a diary entry I could develop into Lillim article on attention.
- Continued watching iPhone photography school.
- Brought Shorty to the vet and got her her first 4 in 1 shot.
- I went out early to walk (3:30 pm).
- I walked Jamboree road and got out of UP.
- Watched Sweet Tooth.
- Sent a copy of my complaint form to James. He thanked me and told me he'll do it.
