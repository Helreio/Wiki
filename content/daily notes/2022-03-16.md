I am grateful for:

1. Finding that trail yesterday. I was able to sit down and watch the clouds, practice being in nature after a long time.
2. The cats being ok back in LB and Lea being with them.
3. Bernice making keto wraps for me the past two nights.

"I am healthy."

# Review

## Studies

I realized that I need a more systematic way of tackling my goals and so I journaled about what would be the structure of a structure note on my life management system implementation, which is starting to become an article-ish note.

Along the way, I also fleshed out, processed, and updated the following notes:

- [[Children don’t seem to think about purpose]]
- [[Maslow’s hierarchy of needs can be used as life areas]]
- [[You can be happy without being philosophical]]
- [[thoughts/presence is the foundation]]
- [[We can live without articulating our purpose]]
- [[Existential events or crises compel us to think about purpose]]

I continued reading Transcend Chapter 3 - Self-esteem.

## Projects

## Others

- It rained hard for more than 2 hours in the afternoon. I wasn't able to walk. I stayed upstairs for a while, contemplated and took videos.
- I walked for 30 minutes towards main road in the evening, frogs croaking around me. I stopped in front of the field twice, looking at the sky and the dark field.
- Watched Narcos s1e3.
- Talked to Lea about self-esteem.
