## I am grateful for:
1. Diwa for celebrating this win and congratulating me and making me feel that this is a big thing.
2. That really, really yummy ensalada wrap I ate last night.
3. The reminder not to seek approval outside.

## Affirmation

"What happens when I am alone in the fields walking and on my desk writing is more important than accolades or fellowships."

## Review

I continued reading The Elements of Style.

We watched Ted Lasso during lunch.

I vacuumed the stairs and downstairs.

I mopped downstairs.

Ili sent their downpayment and I started the migration process (transferred the domain to Google Domains, bought a Hostinger account, and changed the domain name's nameservers to point to Hostinger).

We met JuWa at Siento and we had cakes and dinner.

I started preparing the contract for Ili.

I played Underlords before sleeping.
