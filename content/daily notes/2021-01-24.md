I am grateful for:

1. Being able to build and nurture relationships even if I don’t talk that much as other people—I just ask good questions and try to listen. Maybe that is my relationship style, my strength.
2. That yummy Okara Ube Marble Loaf by Ome. Wonderful bread. A bread of life.
3. My relationship with Maui, which is slowly building up.

To do:

- [x] Daily writing routine
- [x] Continue Scribendi work
- [x] Bond with friends and Lea

“Soon, I will be able to clearly articulate what I want to do. Soon I will find a community of practice and a master.”

Amazing

- Continued Scribendi
- Walked with Lea to Agapita
- Had lunch with Balitbitan Kids at Danielito's (ate Ayam Goren, Masala Pizza, and Aligue Rice)
- Spent more time with the gang at my place
- Talked with Alvin before setting Rem and Claire off
- Spent more time with Lea
- Continued watching The Secrets of Saqqar Tomb
- Continued working
