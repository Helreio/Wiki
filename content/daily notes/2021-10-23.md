Amazing

- Walked barefoot on mud going to Tita Remy's 7 has land.
- Tasted fresh pure buko juice and meat with condensed milk.
- Almost slipped but jumped.
- Tita Remy assisted me.
- Got to taste nilupak na saging and see how it was done.
- Walked with Lea along fishponds.
- Bonded with Lea’s boy cousins over lambanog and gin. Sang a few songs.
- Bonded with Lea’s relatives before we slept.
