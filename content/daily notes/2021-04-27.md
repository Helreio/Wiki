I am grateful for:

1. All the little things that I saw with amazement and mindfulness: the window at the maki store, the rice field with cellophanes that look like balloons, the bulbs at the alfresco dining area.
2. Craig Mod for transporting me to Japan and to an entirely different mood through his photographs.
3. Tasting my first halo-halo for this summer yesterday and sharing that moment with Lea.

"I live a life full of wonder of little everyday things."

Amazing

- I wrote the first draft of the essay I will be writing publishing this weekend: [[Lilim 004 — Umbrellaworts and Truth Partners]]
- I researched Craig Mod’s newsletter style.
- I went out at 4:30 pm ang walked around the different streets nearby, seeing sites, houses, experiences that are new to me at LB. The weather, the sun light, and the ambiance was perfect for a walk. It was a nice walk.
- I reflected a lot about the experience that I want my reader to have as Dan Blank kept on reminding me. For example, I realize that what I wanted to feel while working is this deep connection with everything, this existential feeling where the natural world, everyday life, philosophy, and self merges. This is the kind of work I enjoy doing: study then experience then merge these.
- I also reflected about how best to achieve this.
