## I am grateful for:
1. Finally finishing the second draft of the inclusion proposal. It feels good to have accomplished something, learned, and earn at the same time.
2. My conversation with Lea yesterday about how we can intentionally incorporate spirituality or "art of living" into our conversations and couple activities.
3. Just this vacant space for me to connect with my mind, body, and environment.

## Affirmation

"I am living this life well. I am following my own course at my pace. Everything will be okay."

## Review

We started watching MH370 at lunch.

I reviewed Clay and nurtured some of my relationships.

I continued working on my metalearning project for editing and proofreading.

We continued watching MH370 at dinner.
