I am grateful for:

1. Being able to communicate my preference to FS.
2. Finally articulating what I want to do with my life work in the coming months.
3. Just spending time with Lea.

"I have a great relationship."

Amazing

- I journaled about Itayâ€™s house.
- I continued reading from Zettelkasten.de.
- I started writing permanent notes from the advise of Zettelkasten.de
- Had lunch at Chubby Habibi's
- Stayed longer so I can hug Lea more before I go.
- Walked Lea to Agapita.
- Had a funny exchange with the boy cashier while buying grocery.
- Had dinner-ish with Diwa and Ju: extra hot pancit canton (but no longer extra hot) then coke.
- I tried exploring unfamiliar waters with Diwa. I tried asking questions about her views on gender and learned more about her.
- Learned that Ona de Marmol is Diwa's friend.
- I walked with Ju, accompanied him at Ate Nancy.
