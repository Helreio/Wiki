## Review

Woke up early to prepare to travel back to LB. Papa sent me at Matic-Matic and I rode a Five Star bus. While in the bus, I continued to let words flow.

Lea and I watched the last episode of the first season of the House of Dragon.

I shared to her that I was struggling writing my speech. She helped me arrive at the conclusion that I should write a speech about things I wanted to tell Rem.
