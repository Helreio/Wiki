I am grateful for:

1. That insight yesterday about focusing on the action I can take to generate my desired emotion and not the emotion itself.
2. The reminder on the possibility of me helping others and feeling good about it at the same tme.
3. The tranquility. The sanity. The peace of mind that I am enjoying right now. Something I will protect as much as I can.

“I will offer myself to the world without completely losing myself.”

Amazing
