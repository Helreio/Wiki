I am grateful for:

1. Being able to express my honest feeling to Lea and her accepting and appreciating my honesty.
2. Finally seeing signs that I will be able to outsource some of my work to Nics.
3. Finding out how Montaigne is connected to proto-anarchist thinking.

"I am dedicated to optimizing my ginhawa."

Amazing

- Continued writing quezon trip.
- Continued reading Montaigne's biography.
- Walked to UP and saw new parts at Vet Med.
- Got to share bonding time with Ju over rootbear and some nuts.
- Finished Squid Game 7.
- Lea's summit has ended.
