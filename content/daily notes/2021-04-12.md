I am grateful for:

1. Seeing Diwa and Julius yesterday and learning that they are okay. I also heard from Maui. Things are not that ideal but she is thriving.
2. Papa reaching out to me through Facebook sharing photos and just trying to make a connection. I sincerely appreciate this gesture.
3. Just being here in LB. I just can’t believe I am truly here already.
