## Review

We had breakfast and had vegetarian food.

After breakfast, we watched GSW vs LAL.

We then had an hour-long meeting where I asked about their existing services.

We had lunch then prepared to leave.

Benjie brought us to SM Sucat and gave their downpayment.

Lea and I went to NBS while waiting for the event to start. We bought a book for EJ and I bough a book for myself: *Mabuhay*.

We then observed EJ's dedication and ate some good food.

After the event, we went to Icebergs to catchup more.

Then we went home to LB.

I played some Underlords before sleeping.
