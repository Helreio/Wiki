# 2022.01.08

I am grateful for:

1. 2022's first week. Although I am afflicted by some early year blues, this week has still been great.
2. Lea's message this morning. I really needed to read that.
3. One year in LB.

"I am able to take care of my basics: sleep, food, and exercise, so that I feel better."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about what is making me sad.

## Projects

### Annual Review

I updated my review system for the last time. I decided to drop my weekly reports to simplify the process. I updated my annual review article format and clearly defined the artifacts to use as references for it: the previous year’s annual review article, the previous year’s life goals, and the coming year’s life goals. I decided to keep the past and coming year questions (maybe modify it later) but clearly deliniated its use—to trigger thinking about new goals

## Others

Made peace with the fact that I won’t be going home to Pangasinan probably until March or until this new variant ends.

Watched Mother/Android with Lea and family.
