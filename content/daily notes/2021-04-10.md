I am grateful for:

1. Witnessing Lea facilitate the Skillz interview last night. It was an inspiration.
2. The coming of insights I am able to sustain in the recent journaling sessions.
3. The resolve to really make this creative life work for myself.

“I am a gateway. I am a fearless gateway.”

Amazing

- Ate Auntie Pearl’s Godfather pizza for the second time.
- Finish Weekly Review.
- My conversation with Lea (her questions) made me realize how caution has become an overarching behavior in my life.
