## I am grateful for:
1. Getting my reading glasses. Here's hoping the migraines do stop.
2. Jesa reaching out to me and feeling like I could help a friend make sense of her existence.
3. The opportunity to continue living.

## Affirmation

"Me and Lea's work life will eventually be okay."

## Review

I finished reading [[thoughts/the collapse of what separates us by vincenz serrano]].

I continued reading [[thoughts/wanderlust by rebecca solnit]].

I reviewed the coordinates I took yesterday while walking and saw that they were not accurate.

Ate lunch with Lea at Janges.

Continued working on Candent's marketing strategy.

Do SEP 272.

Walked: Data–Ruby–Pearl–Banahaw–Diamond–Santos–Lopez–Ela–Rambutan–Pili
