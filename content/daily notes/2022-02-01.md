# 2022.02.01

I am grateful for:

1. The first month of 2022. It's now in the books but thank you for it.
2. Being able to share to Lea about my recent reflections on understanding, compassion, and happiness.
3. The challenges I encountered yesterday that tested my compassion.

"My life is filled with wonderful relationships."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about January.

I started watching the documentary film “The Power of Forgiveness” and took notes.

## Projects

## Others

I performed my monthly financial review routine.

I walked towards forestry at the back of Gian’s house and stopped there to look at the evening lights.

I continued watching Smaller and Smaller Circles.
