I am grateful for:

1. Being free last night and having no fruit salad. It's a rest from having to listen to things difficult to listen to.
2. These rain drops. A reminder that Nature is so near me. Yes I can walk far to be with Nature. But the air I breath already is Nature.
3. The reminder that the purpose of everything I do is to feel good, to curate my emotions, to be in my desired mental state most of the time and to protect that peace of mind.
