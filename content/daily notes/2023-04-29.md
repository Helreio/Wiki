## I am grateful for:
1. Froi's presence, for the copy of Santelmo he gave me, and the possibility of being a mentor to me.
2. Receiving confirmation of the fellowship and meeting my co-fellows via email. This is both frightening and exciting at the same time.
3. This silence and space to rest in the morning.

## Affirmation

"I am a writer. I need to be a serious one."

## Review

In the morning, I tried to transfer Patfinder's commune domain name to a new registrar, but I needed the password of Rem's Yahoo email.

Lea and I attended Cris' Bulaklakbayin workshop with friends. The experience was really amazing and Cris' sharing was instructive. I also met a new friend (hopefully will see him around again): Gio.

After the workshop, we had dinner at Aina's. We had ramen and lots of fried veggies and takoyaki.

I played Underlords when I arrived home.

Then I washed the dishes while watching YouTube videos to prepare for the workshop:

I also listened a bit to the first day of the recent UPNWW.
