I am grateful for:

1. Having Lea with me for three nights and four days.
2. That walk last night.
3. Just being alive right now.

"I am wise."

Amazing

- I journaled about processing Evernote, walking at Mayondon, and my life work.
- I explored Stephen Batchelor's website.
- Continued processing Evernote notes.
- Started watching Britney vs. Spears.
- Walked to Mayondon and Bayog.
- I reminded myself of the writing I want to produce: personal essays.
