## I am grateful for:
1. Receiving an invitation to join the training group at Proofreading Pal.
2. Receiving good feedback from friends about my favorite photos of 2022.
3. My life. Despite all the challenges. I am seldom really bored.

## Affirmation

"My 2023 is starting out the right way. I am enjoying every single moment of it."

## Review

I developed a poem that came to me during my walk last night: [[poems/wasak]]. I also wrote why I like to write narratives. I also wrote that the purpose of my work is to help elevate experiences mine primarily and that of others who are inspired by my work. I also listed [[my top values]].

I read [The one thing your career development plan is missing - Work Life by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/teamwork/career-development-plan-values). This prompted me to take the [Personal Values Assessment | Discover Your Values](https://personalvalu.es/). I learned from the test that my top 5 values were:
1. Wisdom
2. Freedom
3. Spirituality
4. Inner Harmony
5. Health

Lea and I had lunch while watching Maid.

After lunch, I took the [MyPlan :: Assessment :: Values Assessment](https://www.myplan.com/assess/values.php?sid=272ebce82d314f06e1012cf7849dd44d). Through it, I learned that the nearest skill that I have that matched my values is really poetry and creative writing.

I also went through my books and chose which to sell. I grouped the others according to usability and accessibility. I then gave a price for each book I will sell and reposted them on Facebook along with the old ones.

I also started researching possible solutions for the Acer laptop problem and trying them out. I learned that a replacement battery could cost roughly 1.5k.

I consulted the I Ching about whether to continue with the Proofreading Pal training or not. I got [Your Reading: 50](https://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/reading/free-online-i-ching/your-reading/?lines=877787&text=barrett&question=Should+I+continue+with+the+Proofreading+Pal+training+process%3F), which is Vessel. My interpretation is that the answer is again pointing me to doing writing instead of editing.

I walked at Pili Drive.

When I got home, I had dinner while watching Cobra Kai. After dinner, I washed the dishes, then reviewed Pivot. I then fixed my projects list and next actions.
