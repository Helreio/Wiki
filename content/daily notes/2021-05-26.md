I am grateful for:

1. Being back to my freedom days (25 days of freedom).
2. Reading Craig Mod's pop-up newsletters and remembering that what I want is a life of contemplation.
3. My chat with Ate Peachy yesterday.

"I am able to put my attention to what's truly important."

Amazing

- Did a Weekly Review.
- Cleaned the house.
- Started watching The Sound of Metal.
- Had a fun night with the gang.
