## Review

I went to Malimgas to buy and eat cheese donuts before heading home to Cablong.

At home, I had lunch with Aldrich, Shane, Papa, and my sister. I sent the visitors off.

After lunch, I watched Cobra Kai on the big screen.

I received the A Humument and a new sweatshirt.

I had siesta. When I woke up, I did my monthly financial review.

I walked at irrigation road. While walking, I had some ideas about how to approach the livelihood search. I realized I need to pursue the projects at the same time to find put my eggs in different baskets.

I had dinner while watching another Cobra Kai episode.

After dinner, I started doing my monthly review. Then I walked at the Garcia Street entrance to look at the stars and feel the cold February breeze.

I went back to talk with Lea.

I slept with Chikako.
