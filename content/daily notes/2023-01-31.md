## I am grateful for:
1. Seeing Rainier.
2. Receiving Wilderness and the Heart, finally.
3. Lea's thought-provoking words last night.

## Affirmation

“Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.”

## Review

I continued writing the essay for Academia Research.

I had lunch with my cousins at Karen's place. Me, Bobet, and Cams rode in Migs' car.

There were lots of foods: seafoods. And the fishpond looked really calming and relaxing.

In the evening, me, Bobet, Cams, and Migs had drinks at Bo's Coffee while we watched the sunset. I also got to tast Theo Philo chocolates: calamansi, sili labuyo, and mangga. Calamansi was my favorite.

Migs and I played some Underlords. I won the first one and he won the second. It was fun to play the game again.

Lea and I talked a bit before I retired to bed.

I continued watching Cobra Kai.
