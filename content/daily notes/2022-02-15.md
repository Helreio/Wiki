I am grateful for:

1. A life with Lea. Through her, I have met really psychologically healthy people, more friends and opportunities to be articulate around others.
2. Witnessing a wedding that is emotional and intimate. It made me think about how I want to get married.
3. Being okay after the second dose. Now i have a vaxx card and do what i want.

"I have an interesting life."
