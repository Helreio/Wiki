## I am grateful for:

1. This morning walk with Lea. Meditating in nature is really better than doing it in my room. The most ideal routine would be to wake up really early, walk, and do journaling outdoors instead of in the afternoon.
2. This peace. At least we have peace no matter how difficult life is.
3. A clean house.

## Affirmation

"I am taking things slowly because I don't want to repeat the same mistakes."

## Review

When we woke up, I invited Lea to walk with me to Freedom Park and meditate there. After meditating, it started to rain, so we had to go home.

Back home, I journaled. For the first time, I used a brush pen. I wrote Rofel Brion's poem Lumot by hand then did some Lynda Barry exercises. I also drew a portrait of Rofel.

Lea and I watched The Crown while having lunch.

I explored some people inside UU. I discovered [DRUUMM](https://www.druumm.org/?fbclid=IwAR2Vb6mFAoXSvKXjPzFfP0HgmB2xPD-QPq3vgWv6FaB-8mDqvHOzyTLO1IY) and [CORAL](https://sites.google.com/view/coralcenterantipolo/).

In the evening, Lea again went with me to walk outdoors. We were looking for an ukay-ukay shop. We didn't find one so we went to EULA and CUPS. We saw a Tagalog-named line of perfumes. I bought one for Lea called Alon.

In the evening, we watched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
