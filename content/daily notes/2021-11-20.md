I am grateful for:

1. The challenge of creating my ideal life fully independently of my past.
2. Choosing the difficult path rather than my comfort zone, because it will ultimately lead to my true happiness.
3. Discovering that I feel better when journaling outdoors.

"Building my ideal life is a worthwhile pursuit filled with joy."

Amazing

- I had another wonderful journaling session outside.
- I cooked dinengdeng and had an early lunch by 11. First time to do intermittent fasting again after a long time.
- Cleaned the dirty kitchen area.
- The standing desk arrived and I spent the entire afternoon assembling it.
- I was able to assemble the desk by asking help from Tito Jun.
- Had a brief walk to Grove and picked up my laundry. I had a brief conversation with the puto vendor.
- Lea met her Alon friends for the first time in person.
- Continued watching Bodyguard.
