## I am grateful for:
1. Getting the job for Krys!
2. Seeing that my right eardrum is ok and not perforated and losing my symptom.
3. Extending my runway so I could explore more about my way forward.

## Affirmation

I am a capable writer and editor. I could help others and support myself through my skills.

## Review

I contacted LBDH and found an ENT who was available the next day.

Cari was having some health issues, so Lea brought her to Jurisvet. I walked with them to Agapita where I tried to find an available ENT. There was none. I decided to just go ahead to LBDH tomorrow. I walked back home. When I arrived, my ear started to feel a lot better.

Back at home, I started right away with the research. I started by studying how to write a literature review. I found the Scribbr playlist on the subject helpful.
