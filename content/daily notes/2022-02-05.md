I am grateful for:

1. Papa's message the other day. It is wonderful to read my father's text again. I miss him. It's good that he's ok as well as Mama.
2. Lea and Tita for agreeing to host my birthday celebration later.
3. My long meditative walk at Jamboree yesterday.

"I am an agent of inner and outer renewal."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about the major categories I will be writing about then my vision, mission, and purpose.

I continued reading Thich Nhat Hanh's biography. I learned how Thay used ethics in his work and his views on the environment.

## Projects

## Others

Received a wonderful cake from Lea's family.

Lea, Jacob, and I played 7 Wonders.
