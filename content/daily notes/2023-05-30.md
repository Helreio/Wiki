## I am grateful for:
1. Finally finishing the notarization of my application to Palanca.
2. Finding some more extra sleeping time a while ago.
3. Lea for fixing us food.

## Affirmation

"I will be able to deliver good work for Candent."

## Review

Went out early to get my Palanca form notarized.

I then went to Divimart to buy placemats.

Watched Grace and Frankie at lunch.

Washed the dishes.

Sent my Palanca entry.

I researched how to create an online archive for my campaigns in MailerLite. It was difficult to do so.

Continued working on the Candent marketing strategy.

Walked to Freedom Park under some rain.

Dinner while just talking to Lea.

Underlords.

Continued working on Candent's marketing strategy and setting agenda for our next meeting.
