## I am grateful for:
1. Kris Ann for bringing rambutan and lansones to us yesterday. Also, for being cool seeing me and her sister living together or at least being civil about it.
2. Knowing the deaf boy. I could talk sign with him and remember that I could speak sign.
3. Last night with Lea. It was fun to just be with her for a stretch of time instead of being in our separate worlds for most of the day and joining only for meals and movies.

## Affirmation

"I am grateful for my life."
