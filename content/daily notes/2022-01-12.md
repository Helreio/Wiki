I am grateful for:

1. Being with Yvette's dogs yesterday. It was very energizing.
2. Ivermectin immediately available yesterday.
3. The fun experiment of building a site via hugo.

### Thoreau's website

I continued working with the Even theme. But then I saw that it was structured more complictedly and the docs are not that clear. I looked for alternatives like the casper 3 theme (but for some reason it wasnâ€™t working). I also tried Tanka, Notrack, PaperMod, Cupper, Hugo Flex, Paperesque, Tufte, and Etch. But none of them had the careful documentation I was looking for. Thankfully, I found Congo, whose author, J. Panther, was very intentional in his documentation. I went through the list of users and saw how people used the theme for their site.

## Others

I travelled to Sto. Tomas, Batangas to see Rem.

I went through a checkpoint but the soldiers did not ask us for our IDs.

I registered for vaccination.
