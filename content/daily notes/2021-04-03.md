I am grateful for:

1. Learning about Alinea and Chef Grant. Seeing how someone can be so dedicated in his craft and so obsessed about doing something new and providing and curating an experience for people. How can that be done in writing?
2. Realizing how I need to be more mindful of my expenses in the coming days.
3. Ms. Lou Ann granting my request for her to shoulder the repair costs from the previous month.

“I will create the best plan to improve my writing and sharing skills.”

Amazing

- Watched another Chef’s table episode about Alex and D.O.M., the chef who popularized Brazilian cuisine.
- After accompanying Lea to her ride back to Calamba, I walked to the public market to see if the bakery is still open. It was! And there was binangkal. I bought 10 pieces (P50). It is my first time to eat binangkal after a very long time.
- I bought groceries and used Gcash to pay for the first time.
- I started my meta-learning project for writing by trying out the free lessons in Joyce Maynard’s CreativeLive class.
- Watched Homeland.
- I also watched the trailers for the other resources.
