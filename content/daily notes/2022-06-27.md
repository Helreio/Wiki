## I am grateful for:
1. Controling my temper.
2. Calling back at Pangasinan and seeing that they are all okay.
3. The many opportunities to practice living and the reminder that at the end of the day, it isn't walking that matters but living itself.

## Affirmation

"I am better than this. I can be better."
