I am grateful for:

1. Another recentering walk yesterday.
2. My movie nights with Lea (even if we don't finish the movies).
3. The excitement and fear of doing things by myself.

"I will find a way to make this work."

Amazing

- Journaled about my life work, particularly the intricate relationship between studying and living.
- Translated [[Kaliskis na Ulap â€” Mga Salin#08-05-1851 Kung ano ang nakikita mo]].
- Ate at pancitan with Lea.
- Continued cleaning the house.
- Listened to some podcasts on Thomas Sowell.
- I walked to South Supermarket, but it was already closed when I got there.
- I saw some walis tingting ans bought one for just P26.
- I finished sweeping my front yard.
- Learned from the internet that there is a high chance that vaccination becomes mandatory in the Philippines.
