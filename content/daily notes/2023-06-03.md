## I am grateful for:
1. The reminder to make the most of my life, my days, every single moment of it and align it with the higher purpose I am aiming for.
2. The opportunity to be with friends today and to help them with their project.
3. The privilege to return to photography.

## Affirmation

"I am conscious and disciplined. I am the owner of my mind and body. I am very capable of making changes in habits to align my life more with my higher purpose."

## Review
