## I am grateful for:
1. No longer feeling alone or lonely, at least physically, because Lea has been constantly with me the past days.
2. Reconnecting with Radha Agrawal's book "Belong" and being reminded that I need to go in to go out.
3. The challenge to build a community I will be inspired of.

## Affirmation

"I am capable of building a community aligned with my values, interests, and abilities."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

I continued journaling my commentary on the Inward Morning. Today, I tackled Bugbee's idea of [[Certainty]] (i.e., [[Working certainty]]). To understand what Bugbee was refering to with certainty, I read the essays [[thoughts/henry bugbee - keegin]] and [[Working Certainty and Deweyan Wisdom — Anderson]].

I also wrote the following note: [[Deciding to live despite throwness requires faith]], which was inspired by [[2022-08-23 seeds]].
