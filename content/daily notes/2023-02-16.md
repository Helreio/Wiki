## I am grateful for:
1. Being able to remember the main points from the FAE and Tiago Forte's Fullstack Freelancer series and sharing them to Lea.
2. The ideas I had while walking last night.
3. Making it through a tough evening.

## Affirmation

"I am on a path of being better."

## Review

I journaled about the emotional part of my pivot plan and what to do about it.

I wrote the note [[Over-attachment to an identity encourages close-mindedness]].

I continued connecting with Velle Almazar. She shared quite a lot about working at Rex.

Lea and I had lunch while I watched Cobra Kai.

I tried opening an Appen account.

I finished SEP 253.

I walked around Batong Malake to buy food then continued inside UP at Velasco.

While having dinner, Lea and I watched The Life Ahead.

I played Underlords.

I started reading [[The Value of Time - How Much is Your Time Really Worth? by James Clear]]
