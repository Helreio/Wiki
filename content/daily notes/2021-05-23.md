I am grateful for:

1. Lea arriving today.
2. Meeting my friends later.
3. Visiting Sunday Market after a long time.

"I am surrounded by great friends."

Amazing

- Walked with friends at the Laguna bay.
- Ate with friends at Eatsumo.
- Walked Claire to her home.
- Finished the Scribendi $300 order.
