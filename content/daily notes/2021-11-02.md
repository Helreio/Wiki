I am grateful for:

1. Learning and understanding what Lea feels when we do explorations.
2. Just this opportunity to do what I am called to do.
3. Being in a capacity to help mama with her meds.

"I am a loving son."

Amazing

- Continued reading and taking notes from articles in zettelkasten.de.
- Processed two diary entries.
- Started watching Porco Rosso.
- Started doing my monthly review.
- Walked to UP: Baseball field > Vet Med > Pili Drive > Rambutan > Victoria Ella
