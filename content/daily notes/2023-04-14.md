## I am grateful for:
1. The reminder to breathe and take things easy.
2. Allowing myself to sleep more awhile ago.
3. Pausing. Pausing. Letting negative reactions go. Waiting for the right words to come.

## Affirmation

"I follow what feels good."

## Review

I continued working on the Ili pubmats.

We watched The Kominsky Method at lunch.

After lunch, Lea and I went to Siento where we had drinks and cake while reading and writing. I started reading "On Earth We Are Briefly Gorgeous" by Ocean Vuong and studied his style.

Around 4:30 pm, we left Siento, bought food at Ate Nancy, and separated ways. I walked to Forestry.

We had dinner while watching Kominsky Method.

I continued working on the Ili pubmats.

I played Underlords.

While washing the dishes, I listened to Craig Mod's Office Hours episode on how to be productive on a long walk.

Lea and I had an existential talk over Bevs' candles.
