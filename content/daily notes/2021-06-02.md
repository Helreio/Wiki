I am grateful for:

1. Writing. For opening up a lot of doors for me. For giving me a life. I never realized that something I used to dread would bring me to where I am today.
2. The freedom to follow my passion and to discover great works of art and be inspired by them.
3. This rainy day. A rest from all the heat. I just hope we can still walk later.

"I am a writer."
