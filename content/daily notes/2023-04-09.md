## I am grateful for:
1. Pausing once more after writing that scathing message to Mama.
2. Feeling some improvement in how I feel in the day and in the evenings after further reducing my sertraline dose.
3. This 5MJ for forcing me to think about what I am grateful for.

## Affirmation

"I will find peace amid conflict."

## Review

In the morning, I finalized writing my proposal for Ili. I focused on working out the numbers. I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNaSC74vm9M) about the best hosting companies and decided to go for Hostinger.

Lea arrived. I cooked lunch then we ate it while watching the first episode of Beef, a series recommended by JayVee.

After lunch, I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6uUczE-qFA) about the best themes to use in Wordpress.

I also asked Lea to give feedback on the proposal. After receiving feedback, I started designing it in Canva.

I played Underlords then walked at Madamba and Viado.

After walking, Lea and I met at Burgarage to try it out. We liked the food!

We fed Franco, then went home. I finished designing the proposal, made final revisions, then sent it to Mau. Her initial reply was heartwarming. And it gave me some hope. If everything goes well, I would get hired to do their website then become their social media manager, something that could free me from job searching, and could let me return to doing my art more fully.

I played some more Underlords then slept.
