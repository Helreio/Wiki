## I am grateful for:
1. The tasty food at Aina's.
2. Champy for being so sweet.
3. The videos yesterday that gave me some ideas on what to expect during workshops.

## Affirmation

"I know my boundaries. I will protect them."

## Review

I started my day trying to migrate the Pathfinder's Commune domain to Google Domains.

Lea and I walked to Demarces to bring Shorty to the vet and have her checked up. The vet ruled that she is okay for now and may not need CBC.

I continued working on the Pathfinder's Commune domain.

During lunch, Lea and I watched Ted Lasso.

After lunch, I reported to Julius my recent transactions connected to Rem's websites.

I then shifted my attention to writing a proposal for Candent. I checked their GoDaddy account and cancelled renewal.

I played Underlords.

I walked to Viado and Madamba. Then I went to Big Belly's to meet Lea. We decided not to continue eating at Big Belly's and find an alternative. We ended up at Burger Garage again.

I played Underlords.

I continued working on the Candent proposal.
