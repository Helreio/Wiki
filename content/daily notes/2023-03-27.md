## I am grateful for:
1. Finding this space and time to attempt to write the essay.
2. Having Lea. As it slowly becomes the case that I am really distanced from my family and they don't ask me anything about my life, it becomes hurtfully clear, that I really have to embrace the life that I am building here and be my most authentic self.
3. The amazing artist friends I have in LB, for showing me what is possible.

## Affirmation

"I am loved and I love myself."
