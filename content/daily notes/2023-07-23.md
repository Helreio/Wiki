## I am grateful for:
1. A decent sleep
2. Seeing that gecko last night and saving it from the cats.
3. The challenge of making all of these work.

## Affirmation

"Every action is a vote to the person you want to become."

## Review

Continued close reading of [[thoughts/the collapse of what separates us by vincenz serrano|The Collapse of What Separates Us by Vincenz Serrano]].

I started formatting [[essays/a never-ending walk|A Never-ending Walk]] in Mailerlite and sent it.

Lunch + Peaky Blinders

Walked: Data–Ruby–Velasco–CEM–Capinpin–Sandoval–Ela–Pili
Back: Pili–Rambutan–Ela–Lopez

Dinner at Siento while catching up with Lea and reading "Melt the Snowflake at Once! Toward a History of Wonder" by David Rothenberg.
