# Review

## Studies

- I journaled about how I jumped from one interest to another during this study period of March. I also wrote about how we suddenly remember purpose. I also wrote some brief notes about my life work.
- I read Transcend (Introduction, Chapter 1, Chapter 2).

## Projects

## Others

- Bought a memento mori item at Shopee for Lea and me.
- Walked at another trail at Matic2-Maronong. I was able to sit down and watch the clouds for a long time.
