## Review

Switched to Dela Costa Building.

Started with [[ANWW20 DJ Ellamil]]. I got the chance to talk to him after his time: talked about AI, nature writing, etc.

After a lunch and merienda break, we continued with [[ANWW20 Elio Garcia]].

After a quick break, I presented [[ANWW20 Vince Imbat]].

We had an hour break.

We returned for [[ANWW20 Lecture Jean Emily Tan]].

We had dinner after where I was able to chat with Sir Junley. We talked about updates on UPB, plight of the Pangasinan language, common Pangasinan writer friends.

Ryan went with the others to drink. I went back to my room and treated myself with some free time and rest.
