I am grateful for:

1. Hearing the stories of grief from my friends last night. It has given me more courage to face the next days.
2. Benjie's work and time and patience and courage.
3. The honesty of Claire, Rem, and Lea. They're all very helpful.

"I am more resilient and wise."

Amazing

- Lea had her first speaking gig.
- Ate at Auntie Pearls.
- Walked at UP.
- Called back home and had a great 45 minutes of convo with my parents.
