## I am grateful for:
1. My photography practice yesterday while on the walk. It got me flowing.
2. The transcendental experiences I am having. They show me the possibility of deep existence. And that is perhaps the reason why I like walking. It is in walking that I get these transcendental experiences.
3. Thoreau for being such an exemplar. I have never been this close to someone dead. I have never been this invested in a single artist.

## Affirmation

"I transcend"

## Review
### Studies

I journaled about my walk yesterday at Doña Aurora.

I read some Austin Kleon posts:

I conducted a weekly review and transferred some new fleeting notes to my Inbox.

### Projects

[[projects someday/career planning]]

I read a chapter on the book “Here Comes Good Sailing” about the influence of Thoreau on E.B. White. The chapter’s main thesis is that Thoreau’s main influence on White is technical, the execution of language. Although White did retreat from society like Thoreau did. I didn’t know until now that Charlotte’s Web was inspired by Thoreau too. Might check on this more.

I started reading Annie Dillard’s The Writing Life and noticed that she reads like Thoreau. Her writing are patches of everything: history, anecdotes, intimate personal perspectives. I also saw some Craig Mod in her.

I then searched if there is any connection between Dillard and Thoreau and there is.

Annie was influenced by Thoreau. Her master’s thesis is on Thoreau and Walden. She married a Thoreau biographer: Richardson. And when writing A Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, she asked herself how can she recreate something Thoreau did.

But unlike Thoreau, she wrote her magnum opus while in a library. She wasn’t a naturalist. She went out at her backyard and converted it into wilderness and people did thought what she was describing was wilderness.

I am still in meta-learning mode—establishing my creative family tree and seeing the works I could spend time studying.
