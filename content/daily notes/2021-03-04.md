I am grateful for:

1. Lea for pointing out my loophole and for making me realize about my tendency. It's fast for me to see the mistakes of other people.
2. A fun time with friends yesterday, a much needed time to bond with people in person.
3. A peaceful exchange regarding the electric bill with Rica, Wilmer, and also Ms. Lou Ann.
