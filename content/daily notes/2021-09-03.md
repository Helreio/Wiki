I am grateful for:

1. One week of freedom passing. It feels so fast and that I haven't done enough. But I have.
2. My laptop's charger still working.
3. Diwa and Claire for thinking about me.

"I have been stronger the past months. I will go home to Pangasinan a new person. I can manage all emotions well."
