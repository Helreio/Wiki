I am grateful for:

1. Our breakfast this morning. I shared conversationa with Papa and Nes and Mama too.
2. This wide, beautiful, and relaxed place my family now lives in.
3. Last night's walk under the moon. So awe-inspiring and calming.

"I am in touch with my core desired emotions."

Amazing

- Journaled with Kako for more than an hour while taking a video.
- Continued Talahardin development. I realized that I need to improve my understanding of Zettelkasten then Evergreen note-taking before I can create my personal system.
- I fixed the things I will bring back home to LB and the things I brought from Sta. Maria.
- Rode my bike to Botao then Irrigation Road where I walked.
- Started researching for standing desks etc.
