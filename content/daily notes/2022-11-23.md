## I am grateful for:

1. The DYL book for raising to my attention the importance of enjoyment in one's work.
2. The meditation session I just had...for grounding me into my reality and bringing my mind into the right space.
3. The opportunity to journal and commune with myself through words.

## Affirmation

"The answers are already in my past."

## Review

In my journal, I listed work-related and nonwork-related activities and provided gauges on my engagement and energy levels for each of them. I then wrote quick reflections about them and placed a star to each which induced a peak experience in me.

I created the following notes:
- [[my workview vs my lifeview]]
- [[private/my good time journal]]

I read [The Magic of a Day Trip](https://tammystrobel.substack.com/p/the-magic-of-a-day-trip).

I applied at Course Hero and took two quizes: one for history and another for psychology. I learned quite a lot about history.

While washing the dishes, I listened to a [TED interview podcast with Ross Gay](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ted-interview/id1437306870?i=1000584059525&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email).

I had a grounding, comforting, and pleasant walk at Pili Drive.
