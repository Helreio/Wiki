## I am grateful for:
1. Discovering the Designing Your Life book. It is giving me hope right now. I shouldn't rush this. I need to make it right next time.
2. What happened because it has made me realize how big a work I need to do to redesign my entire life and to change my mindset.
3. Having Benjie in my life. He isn't Rem. But he is Benjie and that is enough.

## Affirmation

"This is the third day of unemployment. I will make the most of it."

## Review

I read the first chapter of Designing Your Life. I did the first exercise of the book, which was a life design assessment that assessed four areas of life: work, health, play, and love. I took the assessment and found that all my areas are half-filled, which means I have done enough to manage them but not completely full to feel fulfilled in all areas. Half of the work is left undone.

The book introduced the concepts of [[lifeview]] and [[workview]].

Lea and I started watching Ancient Apocalypse series at Netflix.

In the evening, Lea and I watched the movie Dope.
