## I am grateful for:
1. The two weeks or more I've been away. I grew up and reconnected with family.
2. Going home to LB, seeing Lea, and the cats.
3. Papa and Mama

## Affirmation

"Speak up."

## Review

Papa sent me off to Cubao. Had to stand up from Sta. Barbara to Urdaneta before sitting down.

Continued reading Wanderlust.

At LB, the rain has made it impossible to walk from Olivarez to home, so I rode the jeep. A woman passenger who saw that I was paying using the new 20 peso coin exchanged it with a bill when I asked her to abot it to the driver. Another elderly woman passenger held on my knee as she stood up to get off the jeep.

Walked from Agapita to house under rain.

Had a late lunch (sinigang na ulo ng salmon).

Then went to Siento with Lea. Had burnt cheesecake, Vietnamese coffee, and their new fries.

Walked: Ela–Rambutan–Pili–Mondonedo–Royal Palm–UPLB Oblation–Sesam–CEM–Ruby–Data
