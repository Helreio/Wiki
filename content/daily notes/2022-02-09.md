I am grateful for:

1. Lea's surprise. A video I could be watching when I'm down.
2. Reaching this year. I'm 30. I feel old but at the same time, more confident in believing that I am old enough to do certain things. To lead in my own unique way.
3. This beautiful, serene morning.

"I am ready."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about what my 20s were about.

I start re-reading Scott Barry Kaufmann’s book Transcend, particularly on the chapter about the characteristics of Transcenders.

I also took the Characteristics of Self-Actualization Scale in his website. It revealed that my three main sources of self-actualization were:

- Continued freshness of appreciation
- Truth-seeking
- Purpose

My number one source of self-actualization further validated my VIA strengths test: appreciation of beauty and excellence.

Started reading about cryptocurrency in the Philippines.

## Projects

## Others

I sent my birthday message to Beth.

Received birthday messages from people.

Re-celebrated my birthday on my birthday with Diwa, Ju, Lea, and my new friend, Yvette, at Ciento. Tasted one of the best cakes ever: the basil calamansi cake. The cinnamon coffee and the tablea were also superb. The matcha tea to pair all was good. Our conversation, which ranged from the perception of oldness to client work, was really good. I am grateful for their company.

I did a simple birthday walk.

I started watching CM’s stream on building a site using hugo.
