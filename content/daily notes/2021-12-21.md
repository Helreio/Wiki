I am grateful for:

1. Insights on how to improve my routines and systems.
2. Devine and Rekka for being a new source of inspirtation.
3. The four days that I have to continue working on my projects before I get back to earning money.

"Everything will fall into place."

# Daily Review

## Studies

I journaled about my sharing strategy.

Upon going back to the index cards and rearranging them, I realized the following:

- I don't have to learn Linux now. Transitioning towards an opensource lifestyle sounds attractive. But I want to do it with the right reason: an expression of my philosophy (something that I am yet to clearly articulate).
- I need to fully articulate my strategy for sharing before I start thinking about how to design the website. Like the above, context is everything ([[Tools should be embedded in a system to be effective]]). Decisions about the design of my website should follow how I want to share my work.
- After nailing down my sharing strategy, I could then move on to learning how to design the website.
- After designing the website, I should then look for tools and strategies to build it.

Following my realization to prioritize articulating my sharing strategy, I went to my Talahardin and updated and created the following:

- My daily routine to include a daily review.
- [[My daily review routine]]
- [[thoughts/my weekly review routine]] (I updated this while doing a weekly review itself)

By mid-afternoon, I started to get bored about updating my routines, so I started exploring other stuff. I went to [https://100r.co/site/resources.html](https://100r.co/site/resources.html) and explored the resources under Ideology.

- I started reading but didn't finish: [https://www.designlife-cycle.com/macbook-pro-2012](https://www.designlife-cycle.com/macbook-pro-2012)
- I read the following in its entirety: [https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Intro](https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Intro)
   - Reading this led me to exploring laptops and smartphones that are easy to repair.
   - I realized how aweful Apple products are in terms of repairability.

# Others

I walked to UP: Ela-Dawis-Aglibut-Royal Palm-Juliano-Narra-Velasco.

I continued watching HIMYM.

Beth has shared plans to Lea about getting married by January or February next year.

I articulated to Lea my problems and progress regarding thinking about my lifework.
