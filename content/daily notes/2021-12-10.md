I am grateful for:

1. All the days that no one played loud music here. It has been 9 months since I moved here and no one has played music this loud.
2. The chair arriving. I am satisfied with its quality. It was easy to build, large, and has everything I need.
3. A better sleep last night. I no longer feel as sleepy as yesterday.

"I am calm."

Amazing

- Continued watching HIMYM
- Visited Diwa's cats and solved locking their door problem: learned about latch knob and how to use ziplocks.
- While at Diwa’s, I asked Ate Daisy’s help securing my Shopee package. She gladly assisted me.
- Walked at batis first time in the night, saw fireflies.
