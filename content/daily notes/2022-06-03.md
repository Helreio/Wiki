## I am grateful for:
1. Sex Education. It is a brilliant art work.
2. Really enjoying writing my monthly report yesterday. Going back to the past month and objectively seeing how much I have accomplished put me into flow.
3. Having Lea in my life right now.

## Affirmation

"My life is wonderful."

## Review
### Studies

I journaled about my tasks, a three-day walk to San Pablo, and thoughts on Lea.

## Writing

I started piecing together an initial outline for Uman May 2022.
I fixed the signup forms for Uman and Lilim in the site. I also rewrote the copy of the home page. I finally understood how groups and segments work.

### Projects

### Others

- Continued watching Sex Education Season 3.
