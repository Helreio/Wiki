## I am grateful for:
1. Being with my friends yesterday
2. Just this new day added to my life.
3. The people in my life who asks questions when they talk to me.

## Affirmation

"I am loved."

## Review

### Studies

I journaled about establishing relationships with the right people, realizing that my relationship with Lea and Rem are the only relationships where I was really able to explore how to deal with tough convos, etc.

I started spending more time with my Talahardin. I began by putting all under process notes in my Writing Inbox and fixing where new notes go. I also started putting all literature notes there, which includes unprocessed and under process highlights. I started migrating my literature notes from Zotero to Obsidian by transferring literature notes on Progressive summarization. I then improved my notes on how to take literature notes and convert them into permanent notes.

I created the following new notes:
- [[Talahardin cycle as one study session]]
- [[thoughts/reading]]
- [[Progressive summarization encourages collector's fallacy]]
- [[Combine progressive summarization with Talahardin]]

### Writing

CM's Kissa by Kissa finally arrived. I unboxed and shared it to my story.

### Photography

### Projects

### Others

- Had dinner at Sweet Keish and Moo with Lea.
- Watched The Valet. Formulaic, ending not that good, but I did laugh in some parts (3/5).
