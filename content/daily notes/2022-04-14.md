I am grateful for:

1. The clarity of what I truly want to bring to the world.
2. The decision that applying for the grant is not right for me, at least not now.
3. Writing...for all the good things that came out of it.

"I am a writer."

### Writing Improvement

I started writing the story of my first hike to Makiling.

I browsed through Allison Fallonâ€™s websites and work to look for possible resources to try out. I signed up to her Monday Inspiration newsletter.

I thought about how I can improve my Talahardin to accomodate writing narratives. This brought me to a wonderful discussion about types of zettels ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/tpmtqz/types_of_zettels_and_emergence/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/tpmtqz/types_of_zettels_and_emergence/)). I also looked at how historians use a zettelkasten.

My conclusion from all of these is to clearly delineate categories: Talahardin (theoretical work), Narratives, Quotes, Poetry, and Recipes.

To practice my narrative skills in Filipino, I wrote an IG post on the death of the tuko in the house.

I also reviewed how to use Ultralearning in getting better as a writer.
