I am grateful for:

1. Being able to book my trips to Baguio and back to Cubao.
2. My convo with Lea last night.
3. This cold chill morning.

"I am blessed."

## Others

Booked my trips to Baguio and Cubao.

Continued watching The Lost Daughter.

Mama came home with some really bad news about her eyes. This led to me asking help and reevaluating how I think about my resources.

I had a conversation with Lea about purpose, her five-year narrative vision, and the things I learned from Mamaâ€™s recent problem.
