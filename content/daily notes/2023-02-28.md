## I am grateful for:
1. The opportunity to write for Krys and to help her get toward her goal while also earning.
2. Cari for looking well, and Champs too.
3. The poems that came to me last night on the walk.

## Affirmation

"I will finish writing the theoretical framework today and go right into Chapter 2."

## Review

I continued writing on intersectionality theory.

Lea and I watched Teenage Bounty Hunter while having lunch.

I played Underlords.

I read Tammy Strobel's newsletter "We're car-free, again!"
