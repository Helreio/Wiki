I am grateful for:

1. Mama, for agreeing to buy some groceries for me. Big help as I may not have to go to the grocery this week.
2. Knowing that I have friends who also meditate—Cams, Bobet, and now Migs, but I think Megs too. I was once alone in my mindfulness journey. Now I have many.
3. Silence, cold, the beautiful mountain—this where many of my ideas were borne. I am going to miss this place. Though it is now time to step out of it.
