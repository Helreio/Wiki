## Review
### Studies

I journaled about my writing life.

### Projects

**My Writing Life Project**

I continued reading A Pilgrim (Chapter 6) and Desert Solitaire.

I finalized draft for Lilim 3(2).

I posted a story on IG about the exhibit and the map of the internment camp at LB.

**Insurance**

I read a few articles from Mr. Money Mustache about insurance. His views on insurance reflect those in Afford Anything: Get as little of it as possible. MMM uses Direct primary care and a health group. He doesn't have any insurance at all. He takes care of his body and lessens the risks. This made me realize that the subject of insurance alone is prompting me to rethink my entire economic philosophy. An entire month needs to be dedicated to this. I am thankful I haven't done any big decisions on insurance.

### Others

- I continue watching Better Call Saul.
