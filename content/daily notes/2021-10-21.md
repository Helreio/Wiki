I am grateful for:

1. Just being with Lea and cooking for her and serving her. It feels good to love someone and really express that love to help her and support her.
2. Being able to share my journey to my friends and to listen to them.
3. People like Michael Malice who feel very optimistic about their beliefs and their optimism is infectious.

"I am someone who knows what I believe in and stands for them."
