## I am grateful for:
1. Finishing the first draft of this research paper.
2. Learning about all these statistics know-how, which I have forgotten or have never really seen the point for.
3. This opportunity to meet my friends, reconnect, and be human.

## Affirmation

"Great days are ahead!"

## Review

I woke up and started inmediately to finish the Methods section of the paper. I decided to pursue a moderation analysis. I researched for a written process of doing a moderation analysis and rewrote that for the paper.

After sending the draft, I prepared to meet Benjie. I walked to Agapita and waited for him there. When he arrived, we went straight ahead to Bevs' house. We bonded there for a while then decided to just have a picnic at UP.

We bought food at ensalada and caught up with Marky. Then bought some fruit shakes then drove to Freedom Park where we looked for a place to sit on. We had lunch and talked. Lea arrived then Joji.

We talked about their plan to transfer to Los Ba√±os and the state of inclusion of people with disabilities in the workplace here in the Philippines.

When we were sending them off, Lea and I saw Kris Ann lying down on one of the benches at Freedom Park. We had merienda with her. After which, I walked for about an hour and a half to Forestry.

When I got home, I watched Cobra Kai while having dinner.
