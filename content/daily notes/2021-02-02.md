I am grateful for:

1. Being in flow as I finished writing that poem just now.
2. This silence. This breathing space.
3. Just being alive.

To do

- [x] Monthly review
- [x] Perform actions for lipat-bahay project

“I am the space where all of these will happen. I shall let myself be that.”

Amazing

- Wrote the poem [[Kung bakit lumilipat ang mga makata sa Elbi]]. People really resonated with it.
- Finished my monthly review.
- Tasted the shawarma at Doner Dorum.
- Diwa gave me the contacts for the apartments she found but didn’t choose.
- Walked at the left side of UP, around the Vet Med area.
- Tasted Claire's luto: ginataang dahon ng cassava.
- Watched Naruto.

Tomorrow

- Check houses inside UPLB.
   - Ask at Sacay Villas
   - Check Taga House
   - Check at Palm Drive (probably Campos compound)
   - Ask at Catalan Compound
   - Check at Hillside Village
