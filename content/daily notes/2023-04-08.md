## I am grateful for:
1. Having these sources of income that help me feel a bit more secure and think about spending more time in creative pursuits.
2. My beautiful walk last night to forestry.
3. Discovering that Champy could eat by herself on a flat surface!

## Affirmation

"I could master myself."

## Review

I worked on SEP 260 in the morning. While doing it, I also browsed who Craig Mod follows in Instagram. I finished the work around 10 am.

After this, I did a minor revision for a previous overview I did for Bookbright.

I prepared lunch, then ate it while watching Peaky Blinders.

In the afternoon, I created a poster for Nasa Labas ang Ili, which I enjoyed.

After this, I continued working on my proposal for Ili.

I played Underlords, then walked. I tried to do an initial walk of the route I plan to bring participants to my workshop to. There will be some challenges due to lack of sidewalks in some parts, but so far the walk still had some magic to it. I didn't finish it though as exactly as I want to.

I went home and had dinner while watching Peaky Blinders.

I washed the dishes while listening/watching a video about [Oxygen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaoG2WgHo4M), a Webflow alternative for Wordpress.

Then, I continued working on the Ili proposal.
