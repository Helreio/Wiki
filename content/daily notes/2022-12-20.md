## I am grateful for:
1. My conversation with Lea last night. Instead of being a copy assistant. I will just help her out with her systems and habits so she can focus on the work. This is a relief to me. This means I have at least ₱30,000 starting next month and I can now focus on building a passion business.
2. Receiving an email from Cinque about a lucrative job offer.
3. Having a loving girlfriend that I adore and respect.

## Affirmation

"I am on my way to a more comfortable future."

## Review

I journaled about Lea's invitation for me to offer administrative services for her instead of copywriting. I also journaled about how I could rebuild a better emergency fund.

I reformated the Macbook Pro 2012 so I can give it to Lea.

I created the following notes:
- [[poems/say pikakaaro na umaanlong ed bilunget tan liwawa]]
- [[translations/ang pakikipagkaibigan ng makata sa dilim at liwanag]]

Lea and I continued watching Dash and Lily while having lunch.

I replied to Cinqué and informed him I accept the job offer.

I continued my weekly review.

I studied the new Reader app by Readwise.

Lea and I went to JuWa's house to have dinner and ice cream and some fun conversations.
