## I am grateful for:
1. Finding Writers Bay and feeling good about it so far. I hope to give my best shot during the application process and hopefully get in.
2. The opportunity to rekindle my relationships tomorrow as I go home to Pangasinan to join JV in his grief and bond with my cousins.
3. Feeling good. This brisk weather this morning with a little bit of sunlight.

## Affirmation

"Everything is going to fall into place soon."

## Review

In my journal I wrote about how I am feeling about applying at Writer Bay.

I decided not to proceed with my Proofreading Pal application and act from a place of abundance rather than scarcity.

I used the rest of my morning continuing my application to Writer Bay, specifically, writing the 350-word essay.

Lea and I had lunch while watching Community.

After lunch, I gave Shorty, Champy, and Poppy baths. Lea bathe Cari for the first time.

I then wrote SEP 250.

I had a grounding walk at Pili Drive. I noted how I was feeling good.

Lea and I had dinner then we watched Triangle of Sadness (4/5).

After watching the film, I learned that I didn't pass the entrance test for Writer Bay.

I prepared my things for the Pangasinan trip.
