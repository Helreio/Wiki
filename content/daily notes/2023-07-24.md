## I am grateful for:
1. That reading session last night on Bugbee. It helped me further sharpen the work I want to write. I saw a lot of possibilities after ANWW20, but now I also see that the work I want to do fills a gap.
2. The walk this morning with Lea. This wind that gives me comfort after the walk. This large tree that gives me hope.
3. Existence.

## Affirmation

"Life is wonderful."
