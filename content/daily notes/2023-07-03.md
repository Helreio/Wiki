## Review

Continued reading [[thoughts/isang taong maghapon by paolo tiausas|Isang Taong Maghapon by Paolo Tiausas]].

Continued working on Ili's website.
- Reviewed the brand strategy prepared by Lea.
- Studied how to design a great homepage. Found this awesome video: [The Best Homepage Layout In Web Design (Supported by UX) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0db5kA4BfQ)
- Browsed the websites of Ili's competitors and discovered how to differentiate it from them.

Lunch + NHIE

Explored how to use Figma and used it to create a wireframe for the Homepage.

Walked: Data–Ruby–Pearl–Banahaw–Diamon–Santos–Lopez–Royal Palm–Juliano–Roxas–Viado–Madamba–Argañosa–Mondonedo–Aglibut–Capinpin–CEM–Velasco–Ruby–Data.
