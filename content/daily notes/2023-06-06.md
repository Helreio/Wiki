## I am grateful for:
1. Last night's walk which basically laid out my presentation for me. Just have to finalize it today and create the PowerPoint.
2. The possibility of seeing Elijah and Isaac soon and Ate Li and Kuya Eli soon.
3. Cari's sweetness.

## Affirmation

"I will finish the presentation today."

## Review

Continued working with my ANWW20 presentation.
- Searched for a Keynote theme to use.
- Researched JW stats for the presentation.
- Searched photos.

Bonded with Bevs and Embi.

Walked.
