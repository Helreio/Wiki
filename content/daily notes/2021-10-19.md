I am grateful for:

1. Being alive. Not being in danger of death.
2. The thought of going to Quezon and enjoying the fields, mountains, and sea.
3. Being able to move past the breakup.

"I am blessed with a life I need to treasure and make the most of."

Amazing

- I journaled about how to have a healthy relationship with death.
- I continued reading Montaigne's biography.
- I continued processing Evernote.
- I cooked ginataang sitaw at kalabasa.
- I continued watching Squid Game.
- I continued watching Malcolm Gladwell's masterclass.
- I walked at UP.
- It's final: We're going to Quezon!
- I talked to Lea about Montaigne and we had a wonderful conversation about our life works.
