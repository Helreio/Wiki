I am grateful for:

1. The fact that I am starting to ease into my daily rhythm here. It's starting to feel less lonely as I make progress in my intellectual work.
2. The Cruella movie. It has been a fun and engrossing film so far.
3. The available yogurt at Ate Grace. I might buy yogurt there from now on.

"I trust my thoughts."

Amazing

- I journaled more about the LMS workshop.
- I continued developing the LMS workshop.
- I brought the cats to the vet.
- I walked around UP and saw a dog who looked sick lying on the road. I reported it to Cats of UPLB and they responded.
