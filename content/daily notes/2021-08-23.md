I am grateful for:

1. Lea's desire to improve her nutrition.
2. The work of Weston Price.
3. Being clear: good research (not philosophy only) + application + sharing

"I can articulate my beliefs clearly without antagonizing people."

Amazing

- I finished watching Pig (2021). It's probably one of the best movies I have watched as of late.
- I had a nice longer chat with Gelai.
- Rem sent this awesome vlogger who is an Ilocano. Inspiring.
- Saw that Diwa subscribed to my newsletter and responded to Lilim.
