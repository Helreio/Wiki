I am grateful for:

1. The rain pouring down right now. It shall cleanse the land and remove the stench of the smoke from people's burning their gabages.
2. Finally publishing Lilim after much deliberation.
3. Being able to walk. I am not disabled physically and I can guide my own way because I am not blind. I am grateful for this.

"I will learn more about my craft and my readers today."

Amazing

- Published Lilim 1 at blog and modified newsletter page to accomodate it.
- Started reading and taking notes about photography in Craig Mod's lens.
- Went to Calamba and tasted Lea's churros and mango shake.
- Walked at barangay Baybayin and saw the lake upclose.
- Bought and tasted Orient buko pie.
- Continued watching Wild, Wild Country
