I an grateful for:

1. Hearing that Mama and the family and pets are all okay.
2. Finally being able to use a tripod for recording a video. Plus I used the new iphone to take videos. Quality is really great.
3. Lea slowly easing into a mindset where she is figuring out how to establish a strong foundation for going after her real dreams.

"I am capable of becoming the healthiest version of myself."
