I am grateful for:

1. This current room I am staying in. It isn't ideal. The environment can be improved. But it has given me a place I can call my own, while I find my place in LB.
2. Diwaâ€™s help in giving me a list of houses to visit today.
3. These beautiful bird chirpings.

Amazing

- Went to possible rental places inside UPLB.
- Created a [[Temporary Weekly Meal Plan]].
- Walked around Demarces to Mt. Data to look for possible places to transfer to.
- Did groceries to look for possible food to cook.
- Cooked an experimental recipe: canned mushroom, spinach, onion, oyster sauce, and salt. Surprisingly, it was yummy and I felt satiated.
- Watched Dig
- I was locked out of the room. Jomer lent me a shirt. I went to Tita Edna to ask for the spare key, which was thankfully available.
- Rem's workshop on love was very thought-provoking. Through it, I was able to share my belief on amoralism.
