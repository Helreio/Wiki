I am grateful for:

1. Being here in my office, rested, relaxed, and ready to take on my day.
2. Being able to hold that difficult conversation with Lea yesterday.
3. The fact that buses bound to Baguio are already available.

"I am patient."

# Review

## Studies

I journaled about my thoughts about my plans for my trip back in Pangasinan and Baguio and my recent argument with Lea.

## Projects

### VinceImbat.com

I continued to upload Lilim posts to the new site.

I also rewrote Lilim 5, my write up on the freebirth of Makiling. I incorporated the suggestions of Sarah from our previous conversation together. I embedded Sarah’s freebirth video in my article.

I finally uploaded Lilim 2.

I also uploaded the old personal essays that came from my IG posts.

I embedded my Mailerlite forms in the homepage, about page, and newsletter page.

## Others

I continued watching CM’s livestreaming of his building the Ise-ji site.

I walked at highway to buy pasalubong.
