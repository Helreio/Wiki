I am grateful for:

1. Having the courage to go at that street and being alone beside the rocks and communing with the water for the first time here in Los Baños.
2. Being around Lea and her siblings and just bonding with them, especially Kris Ann. I think I am gaining her trust as the days pass.
3. Realizing what I really want from life: study, experience, report, connect with people, facilitate. This by itself was already powerful.

"I am in a better place in terms of my life work since I arrived in LB. Everything just gets clearer and clearer."

Amazing
