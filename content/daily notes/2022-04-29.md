**My Writing Life**

I wrote a narrative of my walk yesterday, which centers around how a dirt road dies.

I read another Bruce Chatwin essay.

I finished reading all chapters related to reading with purpose in DIY MFA.

I read a short story "The Story of an Hour" by Kate Chopin (1894). Then I analyzed it using the strategies presented in DIY MFA.

I read Walden while overlooking the field.

I started piecing together an initial reading list.

### Others

- I continued watching Sex Education.
- I continued watching Ozark.
- Walked at irrigation canal. It rained.
