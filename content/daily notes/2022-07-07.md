## I am grateful for:
1. Finally releasing Uman June 2022 after days of toiling with it.
2. The delicious tinolang manok yesterday.
3. The opportunity to go to Dagupan today and go around town.

## Affirmation

"I am a writer-poet-photographer."

## Review
### Philosophy etc.

### Writing

I started choosing Pangasinan poems to edit to prepare for sending to TLTD. I translated some to Filipino for Rem:
- [[translations/inuman kina mang ador]]
- [[translations/munggo]]
- [[translations/balatong (sa filipino)]]
- [[translations/amayo (sa filipino)]]

I looked around TLTD website and browsed the previous issues. I also read a few poems by one of the editors: Nikay Paredes.

Discovered Ada Limon and read one of her poems.

### Photography

Fixed the problem with my Photoshop's Save for the Web.

I took some photographs while walking around Dagupan and shared them on IG.

I also looked for shops selling cameras. There is only photoline at SM. Others I still need to find.
