# I am grateful for:
1. The movie night and food last night. I really need the company. I need bodies around me.
2. My chat with Diwa. It was reassuring to know that a friend encourages me to ask for support.
3. This challenge. This emotional and mental challenge. I will do my best to get past this.

# Affirmation

"I am stronger than I realize."

# Review

## Studies

I re-read and finished reading the article The Moderate-Minded Writer by Matthew Nisbet ([https://mattnisbet.substack.com/p/the-moderate-minded-writer](https://mattnisbet.substack.com/p/the-moderate-minded-writer)). My reading of it was prompted by the recent restrictions on unvaccinated individuals like me. I have intentionally avoided thinking about the vaccine last December because it wasn't yet an issue. Now it has become an issue in just a matter of days, and I can no longer ignore it.

One of the most important things the article emphasized (a wake up call to me) was that because of social media, our first thought about a major social issue is almost always a thought of someone else (a popular commenter), which appeals to our worst biases. I am guilty of this. My first opinion on covid and then the vaccine is the opinion of steve patterson, who has very extreme and strong opinions about the intellectual community in general. I use his views because it is convenient and easy. But this is what I need to avoid if I want to grow as a thinker—and a person.

I need to think for myself.

The article admonishes careful and deep thinking that considers both opposing perspectives and identifying what is true from each, then making one’s own decision. Nisbet outlines his personal plan of doing this. He is an advocate of long hours of solitude away from digital screens. He has deleted his Facebook account and only went back to Twitter recently but posts very intentionally. He showed some books that talk about the dangers of reading digitally and why we should consider reading back using print. According to him, the internet replaced the linear medium of books and print that encouraged concentration and deep thinking. I don’t necessarily agree with this and would like to point out to him that he was writing this critique on a digital format with links everywhere.

I also started listening on a narration of a speech entitled “Solitude and Leadership” ([https://theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/](https://theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/))

## Projects

### Annual review

I finalized the annual review article by clearly articulating the big goals of 2022.

### Develop vinceimbat.com

I started reading about how to migrate a wordpress blog into the jamstack. I found resources that would do that via Gatsby ([https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/23/migrate-your-wordpress-site-to-the-jamstack/](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/23/migrate-your-wordpress-site-to-the-jamstack/)), but I wanted to use Hugo, so I looked for resources specifically for this ([https://www.technoduet.com/migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site-using-hugo-and-netlify-a-step-by-step-tutorial/](https://www.technoduet.com/migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site-using-hugo-and-netlify-a-step-by-step-tutorial/)). Along the way, I saw some comparisons between Hugo and Next.js and Gatsby, all of which seems to say that Hugo may be more restrictive but it is simpler and less bulky than the two ([https://devinschulz.com/from-hugo-to-next-js-and-back-again/](https://devinschulz.com/from-hugo-to-next-js-and-back-again/))

### Covid 19 vaccine

I started thinking more about the vaccine. I decided to reactivate this project as it has become persistent. Now I am approaching it with a more open mind.

## Others
