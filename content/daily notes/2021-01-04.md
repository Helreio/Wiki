I am grateful for:

1. The poems of Claire and Cris. Cris in particular is amazing. He is a lawyer who creates music and writes poems, clearly into art. His exploration is inspiring. And he is so humble too, much like Froi.
2. The cord for the charger of my bike’s light. I can finally have some peace of mind when biking during these last few days of my stay here in Pangasinan. Riding my bike without any light is dangerous and affects the quality of every bike ride, especially in the evening.
3. Lea’s growth. It may not be so obvious to me at first (even to her perhaps). But her growth is really inspiring. I am encouraged that slowly but surely she will be ready to build a family with me in the near future (if everything turns out well between the two of us).

To do:

- [x] Get a barangay clearance.
- [x] Go to town hall and get a travel pass.
- [ ] Do a Weekly Review.
- [ ] Start the core of the Annual Review.

“I have identified my truth a long time ago, and my truth does not stay here, nor will it stay anywhere else. But it needs to grow in a place of its home, far from where I came from. It is difficult, but I need to do this for myself. And I need to do it now.”
