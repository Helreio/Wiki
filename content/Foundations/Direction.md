# What is a Direction?
Direction has replaced my [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Goal]]s. Now, instead of specifying smaller or larger points I am aiming for, I have a clear direction in which I am heading.

Direction can also be equated with a vision or life philosophy, which I wrote more about when talking about [[Foundations/Values]]. 

With such a defined direction, I make sure to continually optimize my, [[Foundations/Process]] Thanks to which I am constantly moving in the right direction, keeping the right pace ([[Knowledge/Mental models/20 mile march]])

## My direction
I strive to **continuously grow** and **inspire others to grow**, doing so in the **most effective way** and operating at **maximum available scale**, using leverage ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]]).

I embody the above statement of my direction every day in almost every action I take. **This is what my life is about.
