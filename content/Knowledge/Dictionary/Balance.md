title: Balans

According to the [[Knowledge/Other/MBTI]] test, I have an INFJ profile, also known as an 'extremity profile' or 'paradox profile'. For this reason, understanding and using [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Balance]]is fundamentally important to me.

Dodatkowo o balansie mÃ³wili m.in. [[Knowledge/People/Jocko Willink]] w [[Dichotomy of Leadership]] oraz [[Knowledge/People/Jim Collins]] w [[Knowledge/Books/Great by Choice]] i koncepcji [[Knowledge/Mental models/Genius of The AND]].

According to my current understanding, balance is not about striving to stay 'in the center', between extremes. It's about the ability to move around the extremes according to the situation and need.

Examples include [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Discipline]] AND [[Creativity]]. On the one hand, following [[Foundations/Process]]s regardless of circumstances seems reasonable, but in my opinion, it doesn't work in practice.

The reason for this is that our context is constantly changing. This means that even a well-designed process can be effective today but that can change over time.

This is exactly what [[Simon Sinek]] wrote about in his book [[Knowledge/Books/Leaders Eat Last]]. He said:

> And that's what trust is. We don't just trust people to obey the rules, we also trust that they know when to break them.
