A system for capturing and processing incoming input.\n    \n\n  \n\n---\n\n**A System for Setting the Right Goals and Actions**\n\n  \n\n**Summary**\n\n1.  **Mission:** Create an overarching and meaningful mission.\n    \n2.  **Goals:** Identify broad categories of goals and desires that fulfill your mission.\n    \n3.  **Projects:** Identify smaller, individual projects that satisfy each broad category of goals and desires.\n    \n4.  **Active Projects:** Identify your top 5 or 6 active projects as of the moment.\n    \n5.  **Back Burner:** Put all other projects with project notes in the Back Burner.\n    \n6.  **Short-term Plan:** Create a short-term plan for achieving some of your goals within a few months, a year, or a couple of years.\n    \n7.  **Priority Actions:** Flesh out priority actions for each project.\n    \n8.  **Time Blocks:** Create an ideal schedule and block off time to work on projects.\n    \n9.  **Routines:** On your ideal schedule, block times for your other daily and weekly routines.\n    \n10.  **Calendar:** Put any date- and time-specific tasks in the Calendar.\n    \n11.  **Project Management:** Manage projects efficiently.\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 1. Mission: Create an overarching and meaningful mission.**\n\n-   Remember: Your mission is based on your subjective “Why.” It is not an intrinsic part of nature. You create the meaning of your own life. Therefore, you create your own mission.\n    \n-   Update your mission as often as needed.\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 2. Goals: Identify broad categories of goals and desires that fulfill your mission.**\n\n-   Remember: Goals and desires are “feeling states.” We go after something because of the desirable feeling they create for us.\n    \n-   To make them clearer, write objectives for each category stating exactly what you want to experience for each.\n    \n-   Optional: To create more focus, you may create sub-categories with their own objectives.\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 3. Projects: Identify smaller, individual projects that satisfy each broad category of goals and desires.**\n\n-   Ideally, each broad category should be satisfied by three or more individual projects to make them more resilient.\n    \n-   Each individual project should ideally be homeotelic, which means that they satisfy each of the broad category of goals and desires as much as possible.\n    \n-   Each individual project should both (1) generate the feelings associated with the broad categories of goals and desires that they aim to satisfy while they are being done, as well as (2) improve your current state so that you are reach a future position where such feelings are maximized.\n    \n-   Projects must be simple, small, and slow (not complicated, large, and fast) for easy management.\n    \n-   Projects must produce value (better health, new/better connections, new/better skills, money).\n    \n-   Projects must not consume the value produced by another.\n    \n-   Projects should be self-supportive: they should be free, earn money, or help save money.\n    \n-   Projects must be “free” but provide the opportunity to learn, meet new people, and possibly earn money eventually.\n    \n-   For a cash-negative project, find a direct, yet free, replacement.\n    \n-   Projects must contribute to each other without depending on each other.\n    \n-   Projects must be easily substitutable.\n    \n-   \"With each module being self-supported, self-sufficient, internally integrated, and loosely coupled, with no module dominating the others, modules should be easily substitutable, but connected in a loose confederation of \"independent entities\" aligned in a common goal, so that the sum is greater than the parts. In other words, arrange your life like an orchestra or a sports team, which don't depend on any single player.”\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 4. Active Projects: Identify your top 5 or 6 active projects as of the moment.**\n\n-   Work on only at most 6 active projects at any given time.\n    \n-   These projects should help you achieve your goals indicated in your short-term plan.\n    \n-   Each project will have a corresponding “project note” in Evernote, which contains: the project name, the primary and secondary goals and desires it satisfy, its objectives, and the next actions that should move it forward.\n    \n-   Complicated projects will also have a dedicated project folder located at the Active Projects folder on your computer’s desktop.\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 5. Back Burner: Put all other projects with project notes in the Back Burner.**\n\n-   Demote active projects to the Back Burner any time. Do this by simply moving the project’s Evernote project note from Active Projects to the Back Burner folder in Evernote. Also, transfer the project’s dedicated folder from the Active Projects folder to the Back Burner folder on your computer’s desktop.\n    \n-   Promote any Back Burner projects to Active Projects any time.\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 6. Short-term Plan: Create a short-term plan for achieving some of your goals within a few months, a year, or a couple of years.**\n\n-   Prioritize which broad categories of goals and desires you want to or need to focus on at this point in your life.\n    \n-   Identify those projects that fulfill your desires in the short term.\n    \n-   Write a simple description on how you will go about doing these projects at this time.\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 7. Priority Actions: Flesh out priority actions for each project.**\n\n-   Define active individual steps that will move the project forward.\n    \n-   These steps must be necessary, meaningful, and influential to the success of the project.\n    \n-   List them in the project’s note.\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 8. Blocked Times: Create an ideal schedule and block off time to work on projects.**\n\n-   Designate no specific projects on these blocked times. Just block them.\n    \n-   These blocked times will specifically be spent on the 6 active projects you identified.\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 9. Routines: On your ideal schedule, block times for your other daily and weekly routines.**\n\n  \n\n**Step 10. Calendar: Put any date- and time-specific tasks in the Calendar.**\n\n  \n\n**Step 11. Project Management: Manage projects efficiently.**\n\n-   Assure that no single project dominates. This can be accomplished by scheduling and sticking to the schedule.\n    \n-   Make projects simple, small, and slow rather than complicated, large, and fast, so that they are easier to manage.\n    \n-   React faster that the characteristic time scale of changes within your projects.\n    \n-   You should be able to understand and control anything you engage with.\n    \n-   You must have the time to oversee the operation.\n    \n-   Avoid tightly coupled complexities.\n    \n-   Achieve slowness through delayed gratification.\n    \n\n  \n\n---\n\n**A System for Doing the Actions**\n\n  \n\n**Summary**\n\n1.  Priority Actions: Set 3-6 priority actions for the day.\n    \n2.  Do: Do the actions.\n    \n3.  Distractions: Tackle distractions.\n    \n4.  Breaks: Take breaks.\n    \n5.  Batch Tasks: List a few other “Batch” tasks that could be accomplished after the priorities are accomplished.\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 1. Priority Actions: Set 3-6 priority actions for the day.**\n\n-   Set your priority actions in the morning before getting to work (or in the night before).\n    \n-   Review unfinished actions in the previous day and see if they can be done today.\n    \n-   Choose which project/s feels the right one to focus on today. Remember: Adopt a Renaissance model instead of a linear model of productivity. \n    \n-   Extract priority actions from these projects.\n    \n-   Incoming tasks could be prioritized as long as they are really important.\n    \n-   Accomplish these 3-6 actions in order of their true importance.\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 2. Do: Do the actions.**\n\n-   Maintain a morning routine that lends itself to mindfulness, simplicity, focus, gratitude, and flexibility.\n    \n-   Pick the most important action for the day.\n    \n-   Reflect: Is this the most important action I can be doing right now? What is my intention with this task? Why?\n    \n-   Focus exclusively on that task for a bit (10-15 uninterrupted minutes), finishing if you can.\n    \n-   For big tasks, measure your progress in small increments (10-15 uninterrupted minutes) to enjoy feelings of satisfaction and accomplishment quickly.\n    \n-   Work until the first action is finished before moving on to the second action.\n    \n-   Focus on enjoying the activity, not its results.\n    \n-   Approach the rest of your list in the same fashion.\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 3. Distractions: Tackle distractions.**\n\n-   When you notice yourself trying to go to distractions or busywork, pause. Notice the fear of uncertainty. Breathe.\n    \n-   Set a heart intention (“It is my intention to do this task out of love for…”)\n    \n-   Dive into the task with love, even with this feeling of fear in you.\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 4. Breaks: Take breaks.**\n\n-   Practice stillness and quiet.\n    \n\n  \n\n**Step 5. Batch Tasks: List a few other “Batch” tasks that could be accomplished after the priorities are accomplished.**\n\n  \n\n---\n\n**A System for Capturing and Processing Incoming Input**\n\n  \n\n**Summary**\n\n1.  Capture: Capture loose ends in different inboxes.\n    \n2.  Process: Process loose ends.\n    \n3.

    "content": "\nYesterday, I went back to the trail I found the other day along Bued River. Unlike the other day, I wore my shoes and brought a backpack with a small journal, a pen, some tissue paper, and a 100 peso bill.\n\nI left the house around 4:30-4:45 pm and arrived at the site around 5:15 pm. I intended to go straight ahead to the small pond I stopped the other day but I saw that the large machine where I saw two girls staying up the other day was vacant. So I took pictures of the machine.\n\n![[files/IMG_6398.jpg]]\n\n![[files/IMG_6400.jpg]]\n\nI also took a picture of the beautiful rice field that a man was working on the other day.\n\nThe dogs who wanted to chase me the other night when I was passing by to go home were quiet. The white one stared at me.\n\n![[files/IMG_6404.jpg]]\n\nI then went straight ahead to the pond. I had to cover my nose as I smelled that really disgusting smell. I walked and surveyed the place. I realized I actually have some difficulty paying attention to something closer and much longer.\n\nI heard a young boy and an older gentleman down near the pond.\n\nI started walking. After just a few meters, I saw an open gate on my left. It is probably where the trucks are coming from. Then just below that gate, the path started to go down. There was a fork in the road. One path smelled like the disgusting smell I had to cover my nose for. I realized that the smell was coming from the ground itself. Something in the ground made that smell I just don’t know what. The ground smelled particularly off at the path covered with red loose almost humus-like soil which I was afraid to ride my bike on. I look back at my map and saw that this path was the main path and the other path which went further down was actually a path towards the river itself.\n\nI also started feeling like I was actually inside a private property. I was feeling weird. Not the calm I was looking for and that my old trail provided me.\n\nNevertheless, I went down the path and realized that for the first time, I was down at the river itself by myself.\n\n![[files/IMG_6411.jpg]]\n\nI watched the dark green water and the ripples that possible creatures living in the water were causing. There were also birds flying around the marsh. There was a particular bird that caught my attention. Their sound was peculiar. It was my first time to hear their sound. Now that I’m writing it, I think I may have heard this bird first while on the path filled with talahib or Sachharum spontaneum.\n\nI continued walking until I reached a spot where water was flowing over the path itself. It is the river although small. I was afraid to pass it as the land could be soft. It was 5:30 now and the sky was starting to darken. I sat down, got my journal out and drew.\n\nI drew the still plant standing at the middle of a flowing stream. I drew other plants around it and the pebbles that are at their feet. I drew the water and the bird that passed by.\n\nAfter drawing. I stayed a little while. By about 5:55 I started my ascent.\n\nOn my way back, I heard that peculiar bird song again. I still don’t know the song. But it is one of the challenges I am excited to pursue. I wish I could identify the birds soon.\n\nI rode my bike back home using the highway. It was a fast and physically exerting ride. I went home fulfilled, tired, and sleepy.",

    "content": "\nYesterday, I experienced first hand the power of observing animals to understand them. First, I noticed that the cows sensed their masters (?) leaving. As the two boys rode their tricycle and left, the cows started mooing as if to say, “Don’t leave us.” I’ve never seen this behavior in cows and I think I have been around them enough. But probably the most interesting thing I saw was the coming of the group of birds which I have yet to identify. They are not blue herons, although I first thought they were, because they have short legs. They do look like that bird I have yet to identify, which I keep on seeing in the fields. These birds came around five minutes after the boys left on their tricycle. They first soared around the pond as if to survey. A few of them left the group but about two stayed and perched on the fishpond’s fences. That was when I realized they were actually looking for fishes. I want to believe that their coming at the exact moment when the boys left is a sign of intelligence. First, they knew that there are fishes in this pond. This implies that they may have frequented this place a lot of time. They know where to go but “when” to go was even more interesting. It is possible that these birds have been watching on the branches of trees for the boys to leave, which itself is still sign of intelligence. But it is also possible that they only come in the evening, when they ‘re sure that no human is manning the pond. I will try to test my hypothesis and go there again later afternoon but I will be a little earlier so I can observe more of nature. What amazed me, however, was the joy of the experience of observing. I have done observations of myself and of other people but I haven’t really done so intentionally in nature particularly on animals. Usually when I am in nature I just wait for the spark of interestingness to come. Yesterday, I allowed the system 2 mode of my mind to take over and it taught me mindfulness. This nature trips will be a staple of my creative process. But, I also want to use it to learn practical and useful knowledge.\n\nSkills and projects\n\n- Develop identification skills\n- Learn to track wildlife\n- Observe animals in their natural habitat\n- Develop edible and medicinal plant knowledge\n- Develop listening to the language of birds\n- Seek deep awareness\n- Read the land\n- Learn landscape history",

    "content": "\nI left the house around 4:20. I took my former favorite trail to avoid the highway. I saw some farmers already tilling their land for their next crop. I observe the same thing in the morning when I rode my bike. Farmers seem to hurry a lot. There is already a next crop about a week after the harvest. Even while other crops have not yet harvested. As I passed by the farmers tilling their land, I noticed that Herons were not alone in their symbiosis with tractor. A smaller white bird almost that looked like a small seagull were also flying around the tilled land behind the tractor. I need to identify this bird.\n\nI just stopped for a while to take a photo of an old water pump around the end of the trail. The effect of the sunlight on it caught my attention.\n\nI moved on and realized while I was at the wall that it actually takes me a lot of time biking towards wherever I need to conduct my fieldwork. If I will conduct it within San Jacinto, it takes me around 30-40 minutes just biking. This is the reason why, ideally, I really need to leave the house earlier if I want to have enough time observing. If I leave home by 3:00 pm, I could arrive at the place by 3:30 pm and since I go home around 6:00 pm when it really starts to get dark (at least at this time of the year), this means that I have about 2.5 good hours for observation. While biking on the wall, I also saw a mother hugging child while at the middle of field. When I reached the CIS, I walked towards the pond. Someone was singing in the karaoke. I knew my observation would be challenging but I pressed on. I’ll find a spot that is less noisy.\n\nI saw a very young cow sleepy under the sun.\n\nI saw an interesting unidentified blue bird with an interesting song. I really need to find a good guide book on birds in the Philippines.\n\n![[files/Blue_bird.jpg]]\n\nI started noticing how diverse the variety of species in the pond is and how the water creates this diversity as well as the fact that the small forest is undisturbed.\n\nNo one was in the pond at that time. Only a few people passed by riding on their motorcycles.\n\nAs I avoided the noise, I looked for a way to circle the pond and go near one of its banks. I found that there was actually a path around the rice field. I didn’t see this the other day probably because it was already dark. I followed the path and entered the small spaces between bushes and I found this spot which was opposite the fish cages.\n\n![[files/CIS_pond_spot_3.jpg]]\n\nThere was a lone cow that bellowed very loudly when I was around. Maybe it felt threatened.\n\nThen the most extraordinary thing happened. I witnessed and took a photo of cows drinking water from the pond! Amazing!\n\n![[files/Cows drinking.jpg]]\n\nThe birds I saw yesterday, one of them returned around the same time.\n\nI heard a bird song for 5 minutes but I didn’t really get what it meant.\n\nI saw a small, thin man come down the pond to put on his net. When he approached to use the path I was sitting on, I asked him what kinds of fishes they get from the pond. He said tilapia or carp. I asked if these were cultured. He said, no. So these were wild fishes. Where is the water coming from?\n\nWhile observing, I applied Brian Mertins' questions.\n\nHow many different species am I seeing?\n\n- I identified about six birds: the common sparrow which flocked over the tree below where the water falls, a small black swallow that I also see in the fields, a lone navy blue bird, the brown stout bird that came to the pond early evening when the boys left, maria capra, and a heron.\n- There were about eight trees around the pond.\n- There were a lot of shrubs but I saw about 10 different species.\n\nHow many different aged trees am I seeing?\n\nThe age of trees are different. There were about two of them around the pond which were really old. Some of them about the same age, maybe middle-aged trees.\n\nAm I at the edge or the interior of this forest?\n\nThe species are variant. I am definitely not in the interior of a forest.\n\nI saw that the pond (or maybe a part of a river?) is still wide and there are other spots I could use for observation. I am not done doing fieldwork in this area.\n\n**Other Field Notes**\n\n- Read the clouds. Read the birds.\n- How can I be truly authentic?\n- You know you're good in mindfulness while in Nature when someone singing katawan katawan in the background and you fins yourself still enjoying your walk despite.",

And it did preventing me from conducting a field work. I am a novice weather observer. I shouldn’t expect a lot from myself right now.\n\nAfter the rain, I went straight outdoors. I was still hesitant whether to go to the pond or not. But I decided I’ll go. I arrived at the pond around 5:40 and it was already growing dark. I couldn’t harvest enough with my eyes.

I want to experience staying outdoors by myself camping and facing the solitude of the wilderness head on. I want to learn how to survive on my own in the middle of a forest. I also realized how much I need to heighten my mindfulness, how my mind and body resists being where I am. The feeling was not good but it was informative.\n\n![[files/IMG_6485.jpg]]",

It is native to Asia. It is widely used in native medicine in Tamil Nadu, India.\n      - Indian heliotrope is an annual, erect, branched plant that can grow to a height of about 15–50 cm (5.9–19.7 in). It has a hairy stem, bearing alternating ovate to oblong-ovate leaves. It has small white or purple flowers with a green calyx; five stamens borne on a corolla tube; a terminal style; and a four-lobed ovary.\n      - The plant is native to Asia. A common weed in waste places and settled areas.\n      - In the Philippines, the plant is chiefly used as a traditional medicine. The extracted juice from the pounded leaves of the plants is used on wounds, skin ulcers and furuncles. The juice is also used as an eye drop for conjunctivitis. The pounded leaves are used as poultice.\n      - *Heliotropium indicum* contains tumorigenic pyrrolizidine alkaloids.\n      - [More info](evernote:///view/104296057/s545/a35148dc-69cb-4418-90cf-6771961181fe/a35148dc-69cb-4418-90cf-6771961181fe/)\n8.

Plants grow undisturbed.\n\n![[files/IMG_6531.jpg]]\n\nI missed hiking after seeing this slope.\n\n![[files/IMG_6536.jpg]]\n\nAt the end of this path was a small hut and a wide beautiful field. But there was no grazing cows and no place to watch the lake, only a small dirty marsh. I went back and thought this was the end of the lake. But I was wrong. The path to the grazing cows should be beside/behind this wide field. Should go back and check it out.\n\n![[files/IMG_6538.jpg]]\n\nWhile going back to the main road to the lake, I caught a beautiful glimpse of the sunset sky.\n\n![[files/IMG_6542.jpg]]\n\nStarted walking back to the third observation spot. The best spot so far. Along the way, I saw mushrooms sprouting out from cow dung.\n\n![[files/IMG_6552.jpg]]\n\nTook photos of some plants along the way. Many of which I can’t identify. Will need to do some more work to identify them.\n\nI was wrong. Snail eggs still around although perhaps not as abundant as before.\n\n![[files/IMG_6565.jpg]]\n\nThree dragon flies or two on repeated dancing.\n\nI saw that some small lotus were coming out of the mud just beside the water. So lotus could grow on soil as well as on water? Are they amphibious?\n\n![[files/IMG_6566.jpg]]\n\nWent home by 6:00 pm as usual.\n",

But the rain was light and the ground is not as wet.\n\nI brought Mama’s phone with me and when I took it out of my bag I thought I didn’t bring my phone. I only learned that my phone was there too when I got home to return Mama’s phone and instead of giving her her phone, I was actually giving her my phone which was inside the bag after all. What a hassle! But I was able to practice stoic challenge and still enjoyed my fieldwork.\n\nThe Cordillera is in full disclosure.\n\n![[files/121966830_344113090250021_3058807334436114438_n.jpg]]\n\nI wonder how geologists classify or categorize the different parts of a mountain range.\n\nFrom where I am standing, there seems to be five mountains in the Cordi range.\n\nThe peaks will be a lot but as I count them probably more or less 20.\n\nFour herons freely moving about this field in front of me. One black dog behind them roaming.\n\nSky reading\n\n- Low medium cumulus clouds scattered in the north with altostratus and altocumulus behind them.\n- Same on the east but stratus are more prominent. Cumulus larger. The Cordillera is blue but not hiding much of itself\n- South is filled with low cumulus. I think that is what brought quick and light rain this morning or early afternoon. It is probably raining at Villasis and Urdaneta now. Above the large low cumulus are altostratus clouds.\n- The west has more altostratus. Just a long low stretch of stratocumulus.\n\nThese green palay are so pleasing and relaxing to the eye.\n\nTwo needle dragonflies playing. One bit the other’s tail. I was there about one feet away from them squatting and they didn’t get startled by me until I tried to hold one’s tail. Then they flew away.\n\nThat small bird doesn't look like a sparrow. It is an entirely different bird. I saw it up close. It is darker in color, smaller, and more agile. It’s probably the pacific swallow\n\nTwo men walking with two sacks. Where are they bringing it?\n\nThese birds look like they're walking on water.\n\nOwl is out and roaming the field facing North.\n\nThe reason why we need nature writing is because there is one nature but multiple experiences of it. When you write your experience of the landscape, you create your own landscape.\n\nI saw it. The owl found a prey. A mouse. It hovered down and maybe gone for more than 5 mins. It was eating. Then it moved it's prey to a different location nearby. It is still feasting. That meal is probably its first and will be enough for now. Owls help regulate the population of mice in the fields, which extend to mice inside our houses. I wish we have more owls but we only have one. Dondon said, the owl’s partner was killed.\n\n**Botany**\n\n![[files/121458984_263803804983903_1918544217992152160_n.jpg]]\n\nFound this plant. Nature ID says it is probably ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea). But to confirm, I need to cut it and smell if it has a minty smell and hairy outer surface.. If not, it is possible that it is the common mallow (Malva neglecta).",

A boy was throwing stones at them.\n\n![[files/IMG_6584.jpg]]\n\nHerons were abundant in the tilled rice paddies.\n\nA young man was tilling the soil using a motorized machine on my left. An old man was tilling the soil by using his weight, sitting on a sledge, and letting the carabao drag him across the paddy.\n\n![[files/IMG_6585.jpg]]\n\nWent back to the pond. I resolved to look for a new trail. I can’t go back to the right trail because there were two old men on the tip of the path. I decided to try to discover a new watch spot on the left trail.\n\nI saw three young calf basking under the late afternoon sun.\n\n![[files/IMG_6590.jpg]]\n\nI found a path towards a rice paddy below. The path was forested. While looking for a path down the rice paddy, I heard an unusual sound. At first I thought it was inside a tree. Probably a frog that’s making a really unusual sound. I recorded the sound only to find out I was actually quite far yet from its origin. It was a bird song and the song was perhaps striking the tree branches creating a wooden sound.\n\n![[files/Bird Song 2.m4a]]\n\n![[files/IMG_6587.jpg]]\n\nRain clouds were hovering above me and there were some lightning and thunder. I was afraid it would rain while I was looking for a trail but I was ready anyway.\n\nI brought my bike down with me and dragged it along this wet rice paddy.\n\n![[files/IMG_6600.jpg]]\n\nI was not disappointed. I found what is perhaps the best vantage point of the pond so far.\n\n![[files/IMG_6607.jpg]]\n\nI left around 5:50 worrying that the sky will start falling. While there, I came with some realizations that I may not have had if I didn’t see the view. I realized that I need to organize my entire life according to what’s really important to me and that my interests have hierarchies based on this organizing principle. I also became convinced that I need to speak my truth clearer and more regularly and I can do that by implementing a publishing schedule and sticking to it. The world needs to see what I am seeing.",

Some patches of clear sky.\n- East: dispersed cumulonimbus above cordillera.\n- South: low cumulus with dispersed cumulus above it almost stratus\n- West: low cumulus clouds with some stratus above and behind. Some cumulus  and altocumulus above. Clearer sky and patches of blue.\n- Overhead: dispersed thin cumulonimbus\n\nThe maple-like plant and the marijuana-like plant seems to be the same plant! They have similar flowers and stems but different leaves. A variety? Or were the leaves eaten by insects? If eaten, they were so proportionately bitten.\n\n![[files/IMG_6618.jpg]]\n\nAs I came to the hill towards CIS, I decided to walk to get my spirits ready for nature. While walking, I saw the mango trees.\n\nWhy do some mangoes have new leaves why others have none? Are mangoes shedding their colors?\n\nI got closer to the house near the pond. I saw a few bottles (of beer?) and a few pillows. Perhaps it is still used.\n\n![[files/IMG_6628.jpg]]\n\nI also got closer to the fences the men built to catch wild fish. The fences have blocked the growth of the lotus so that they are concentrated on only a portion of the pond. Perhaps this was a good thing? I wonder if a lotus-less pond is actually a more diverse pond. It sure seems ideal for kingfishers and is aesthetically pleasing to the visitor.\n\n![[files/IMG_6623.jpg]]\n\nI saw a kingfisher-like bird perched on the railings of the bridge. I didn’t want to startle it but I had to see it closer. This was the exact moment I needed my binoculars! I managed to get closer but when I wanted to get even closer, it sensed me and perched into a nearby tree. When I walked near the tree, it sensed me again and finally flew towards the side of the pond where it perched on another tree, which I once observed a similar bird perched, far from my reach.\n\nThe bird has a reddish then blue back and tail with a long beak that was also reddish.\n\n![[files/IMG_6629.jpg]]\n\nI walked back to the new spot I discovered yesterday. There were more cows grazing in it than yesterday (only two) but I’m quite sure the mother and calf that I saw yesterday were still here. A calf was curious and got really close to me.\n\n![[files/IMG_6636.jpg]]\n\nAs I sat on the pond, I saw that there was actually not one but at least three kingfishers in the pond. They were diving into the pond one after the other then perched back into the branches of the nearby kawayan. Later as I continued to watch them, I realized there were actually more than five kingfishers in the pond! I am so glad I found this because I used to think that there was a single kingfisher in the pond. They are rare birds in our place because there are very little bodies of water fit for their feeding. You won’t see them hovering over the wet paddies. Probably not in the flowing Bued river. They, perhaps, need the still waters of the CIS were wild fishes inevitably come.\n\nThe pond continues to spark awe in me. I wrote a poem of what was happening in the pond yesterday.\n\n![[files/IMG_6640.jpg]]\n\nI think I saw a snake moving on the water or was it a fish? It looked like a snake’s movement with all its curling.\n\nI need a fire inside me. A fire that will let me live with passion like I did before.\n\nDamselflies and devil’s darning needle dragonflies over the pond.\n\nAmong my new discoveries yesterday was a kind of insect that floated on the water along the pond’s banks. I drew it this way.\n\n![[files/IMG_6663.jpg]]\n\nIt moved in a jerky motion that looked like a person lying down on his belly and trying to slide through a sheet of ice. They are water striders.\n\nHere’s a video about [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2unnSK7WTE).\n\nI also saw a devil’s darning needle dragonfly. Two of them actually made an unusual behavior. One bit the other’s tail end. After getting its tail bit, it started striking its tail on the water. Was it hurt and is using the water to soothe its pain? Or were they mating?\n\n![[files/IMG_6645.jpg]]\n\nI watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkDB9Wj_SRg) film on damselflies and think that what I actually observed was mating. They mate and automatically lay eggs.\n\nI roamed a bit around the spot and explored the trees growing in it. I peeked and looked if I can see the end of the pond from here. The pond was still really long. It’s possible that I haven’t seen its end yet.\n\n![[files/IMG_6647.jpg]]\n\n![[files/IMG_6651.jpg]]\n\n![[files/IMG_6652.jpg]]\n\n![[files/IMG_6653.jpg]]\n\nI tried looking for a way to continue my exploration of the pond’s banks. I saw a trail but it was thickly covered by shrubs and it seems to go directly into the pond. And since I don’t have enough time to explore, I decided not to continue my exploration.\n\nI instead looked at the clouds and waited it to get a little later before going back home.\n\n![[files/IMG_6656.jpg]]\n\nI used the former favorite trail to go back home and saw that the builders actually made a lot of progress building the road. Some segments have now cements side by side and it’s pretty easier to travel over cement on the right side to the main road.",

    "content": "\nI got out of the house early yesterday. About 4 pm. I had an itch of the outdoors after much bad weather the past days.\n\nI used my favorite road to go to San Juan. I saw the men working on the roads resting. They’re fast. They might be able to finish the road by the end of the year or even the month.\n\nTook a photo of this tree that has a lavender flower for identification.\n\n![[files/IMG_6739.jpg]]\n\nI debated whether to go back to the pond or to explore a new bike trail. I was tempted to go back to the pond because my Bushnell arrived the other day and I was excited to use it to observe the kingfishers better. But before I crossed the Fortune Dragon farm, I decided I wanted to see something new, to expand my range of awareness, that itch that feels so good to scratch. So I decided to follow the trail that would lead me to the Pugaro-Babasit road, which could possibly lead me to a nice spot I went to years ago, the path, which made me realize I actually want to document the bike trails in my locale.\n\nFrom Fortune Dragon farm, I would usually always turn right until the road leads me back to the highway. But yesterday, I turned left to follow the way to Babasit-Pugaro. After turning left, I would again turn right in crossroads to get me back to the highway. I tried diverting to left once and the path led me to Manaoag’s garbage pile.\n\n![[files/Babasit-Pugaro Road Bike Trail.png]]\n\nThe path to Babasit-Pugaro road were full of residential lots but people were not really many.\n\nI saw this weird fruit or flower from a tree (perhaps). I have to identify it.\n\n![[files/IMG_6742.jpg]]\n\nBabasit-Pugaro road though was a silent road full of trees, some of which canopied some parts of the road creating a forest-like experience.\n\n![[files/IMG_6744.jpg]]\n\nIt is also here where a government evacuation center was built. The place where it was built in was actually nice. It had a good view of the sunset.\n\nI reached the end of the road by around 5:11 pm. I saw this view on the right.\n\n![[files/IMG_6747.jpg]]\n\nAnd found this near where some pieces of shattered glass were still on the road. I wonder if something bad happened here.\n\n![[files/IMG_6748.jpg]]\n\nAlso found an interesting tree that should be identified.\n\n![[files/IMG_6745.jpg]]\n\nThe end of the trail was the graveyard - public and private. I didn’t seem to see what I was looking for. The trail that I found years back seems no where to find. I thought maybe it was in the other side of the graveyard. I might check. Although as I rode my bike back, there was a portion of the path where it could have possible been the spot I was looking for. Although I do remember a more elevated spot, clear, and with winding roads from it.\n\nThe ride going back home was a lot easier. It seems like when we are still discovering the path, time pasts by slowly but when we have found it and use it again, time moves fast.\n\nEverything could have been perfect if it wasn’t for the dog that started chasing me on Bayaoas Road, I could’ve reached the house easier. And yet it happened and my rear wheel got a hole. I walked from Bayaoas Road up to the house. Interestingly, a couple had the same conundrum but they were riding a motorcycle. They dragged their motorcycle from Babasit (possible farther) to Santa Maria where the first vulcanizing shop can be found.\n\nI took what happened as a stoic challenge and did not let anger or frustration consume me. It was a nice field work overall. Might go to the pond today.",

This month, I finished the following books: LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring, How to Take Smart Notes, and Dept. of Speculation. Through Rem, I discovered Rofel Brion’s poems. I bought two of his books and tried to finish one so it could make it to my 2020 hero books. But I didn’t want to rush reading it, so it didn’t make it to the list. My most important breakthrough for the month was discovering zettelkasten and studying Sonke Ahrens’ book about it. This lead me to trying out Roam (among other apps) and Andy Matuschak’s note-writing system. Creating a zettelkasten is an important part of my life management system. Since it was the holiday season, it was also a month of connecting to friends and family. Migs went home after passing the boards. We bonded together and I also got to see my friends in Binmaley. Bobet told me about carpool services, which changed my life for the following weeks. I am not living in Los Banos and reunited with Lea because of him. The Tungko also got together before the end of the year, and I received a beautiful poem and a blind contour drawing from Maui. In my creative life, I released an article detailing my multipotentialite journey. There I first admitted to the public that I only work 5-10 days a month. While the article was received well, it also received some criticism, which I accepted gracefully. I also finished reading Thoreau’s journal this month. During this month, I tended Doji’s wound. I also received a potential credit card fraud problem, which I handled with emotional maturity.\n\n## Good Events\n\n- Discovering Rofel Brion's poems\n- Experienced Benjie's art journal slides\n- Started reading Lifelong Kindergarten\n- Started exploring Thomas Sowell's work starting with \"Cosmic Justice\"\n- Started reading How to Take Smart Notes\n- Discovered Andy Matuschak's note-taking process and modified my daily writing routine to follow it\n- Lea sent me flowers\n- Migs passed the medical board.

    "content": "\n5:50\nPababa na ang araw pero maliwanag pa rin. Maputlang kunti ang sinag nito. Hindi matapang na orange. Mainit sa balat.\n\nMay mga nahulog na mangga. Meron ding mga pirasong halatang binalatan. Kinain. Walang mga prutas sa mangga na nasa tapat ng mga ito. Galing ba ang mga ito sa puno? O nahulog ng nakabisikletang dumaan.\n\nMalamig ang simoy ng hangin. Kahit na hindi naman natuloy ang pinakaaasam na ulan kanina. Masarap huminga rito. Malamig at magaan ang hangin. Para akong hinihele.\n\nMay mga tanim na okra sa harapan ko. Pero tila napabayaan na sila. Nilamon ng mga gumagapang na halaman. Pinayuko. Malalaki at matatanda na ang mga bunga ng okra. Lupa na at hindi tao ang kakain sa kanila.\n\nIto siguro ang sining ng pagmamasid. Ang sining ng pagtingin. Sa pagtingin at pagsasalubong ng mata at ng mundo, may mga tulang isinisilang. At hindi mo sila mapipilit lumabas. Lumilitaw lang sila na hindi inaasahan. Kailangan lang maging bukas.\n\nPara saan ang maliit na lawa sa kanan ko? Kumati na ang tubig. Nagkandahulog ang mga dahon ng kawayan at may ilan pa ngang tuluyan ng nabuwal. Walang mga isdang lumalangoy ni palaka sa lawang ito. Mga dahon lamang.\n\nBakit ba kailangan ko pang masyadong pag-isipan kung saan ako lulugar sa sining ng pagsusulat tungkol sa kalikasan. Kailangan ko lang ng metodo:\n1. Maglakad sa hapon.\n2. Magmasid.\n3. Magsulat at hayaang dumaloy ang kung ano.\n4. Balikan ang mga naisulat at tignan kung mayroong tula, paninulang sulatin, kuwento, atbp. naroon.\n\nOo magbabasa pa rin ako ng metodo at ng mga nauna nang naisulat. Pero pinakamahalaga pa rin ang direktang pagsasanay.\n\nMay maliit na bahay sa gitna ng bukid. Sementado. May bintanang maliit pa nga. May yerong bubong. Mukhang hindi ito itinayo para maging alolong. Dapat kawayan lang to. Mukhang itinayo ito para maging bahay. Oo nga, dahil may nakakonektang kable ng kuryente. Pero mukhang wala nang nakatira. Mainit sigurado diyan pag tanghaling tapat.\n\nMay maliit na gubat ng mga punong mahogany sa daang ito. Natutukso akong pumasok pero wag na lang muna. Sa susunod siguro.\n\nMay ilang nakabitin na kulay rosas na itlog ng kuhol sa punong labas na ang ugat. Pamilyar ang punong ito. Ito ba yung napakataas na punong tanim ni Daddy dati na dinarayo at pinagiitlugan ng malalking mariposa? Mukhang ito nga yon. Mamamatay ba ang mga itlog ng kohol kapag hindi natubigan. Halos wala nang tubig ang canal. Matagal nang walang ulan. Binabalikan pa ba ng inang kohol ang mga itlog niya? O kaniya-kaniyang buhay na sila kapag napisa? Sino ang magliligtas sa mga kohol na ito sa tiyak na pagkalipol?\n\nBakit ba ako maghahanap ng likhang mahirap iginapang? Hindi yon ang hanap ko kundi yung abot-kamay, madali, maginhawa.\n\nPaano ba nagkakaroon ng kahulughan ang isang bagay? Intentional tayong nag-iisip. Humahanap ng mga salita. Humahanap ng mga anggulo at istruktura. At ito ang idinaragdag natin sa pagpapaliwanag, sa pagpapalawak ng saysay ng isang bagay.\n\nTulad ng isang salita na inuusisa ng malaliman upang bigyan ng kahulughan, ang mga bagay na nakikita ko sa kalikasan at mga isip at nararamdaman habang naroon, ay may nagkakaroon ng kahulughan, kapag mas tinitignan ko ng malaliman, sinusulatan. Nagiging mas may kabuluhan at saysay ang mga ito sa akin.\n\nDagdag pa rito sa kaibahan ng hangarin at kabuluhan. Hindi sasabihin ng bata ang hangarin niya. Susundan lamang niya kung ano ang nararamdaman niyang gawin. Pagkatapos niyang gawin ang isang bagay, at magkukuwento siya tungkol sa ginawa niya, bumubuo siya ng kabuluhan ng kahulughan ng ginawa niya.\n\nMahirap minsang malaman kung ano ang gusto natin. Pero kapag nakasubok, nakakita, nakatikim ng anuman, madali sa'ting magsabi kung nagbigay kahulughan ba ito satin o hindi. Mas madaling isipin ang kahulughan ng buhay kaysa isipin ang hangarin nito.",

A black kite is hovering above like a lawin. A kuliglig is about to pass. On it, wood. Cut wood. Fuel for the owner. Will this be another dirt road to lose this year? Looks like it.\n\nCuttings revealed some accumulated trash. Some children are playing, running on the middle of the field. A karaoke singer sings an Asin song on Nature. Some cows are grazing on what looks like dried grass.\n\nDevil's needle flies around over some water left on the irrigation canal.\n\nThe children playing on the field are those controlling the black kite. Some goats are grazing too.\n\nThis is a massacre of trees. Some look like 10-15 years old. Some probably more. A pied fantail is perched on a tree cadavre. It flies low as I passed by.\n\nSome iron structures are already built lying on the side of the road. I think they are cementing the road as well as the irrigation system. About time for farmers. But so long for us walkers.\n\nHere's a poem idea: write a poem detailing the process of ending the life of a dirt road. Buhay para sa magsasaka. Kamatayan sa mga puno't naglalakad na manunulat.\n\nPeople are not used to someone walking alone with the bike on the side. He thought I was drunk. What was his name? Domeng?\n\nWhy does the frog hop then stop? Why doesnt it go straight to where it has to go?\n\nThe big brown bird of my past walks is here. I can hear it. As well as the siklings. The sound of crickets are here too.\n\nI am thinking about starting a self-directed fellowship with some artist friends. It involves spending some time together reading other people's work. Since all are rough drafts there is no reason to down anyone. We just have to give community and other eyes.\n\n[[Losing another dirt road]]",

    "content": "\nPeople are building concrete houses at the middle of the fields. No trees near them. Wherever someone does this, he is saying, \"I have made a decision. I am staying here. I am putting my roots here.\"\n\nIt is cool today. Sky full of clouds but the promise of rain is unsure. Farmers are spraying their harvests. I also hear paranum from a far.\n\nI pass by some leaves that were burned not by the sun but by someone who burned some dried leaves and grass from below. The tree grows from below an irrigation canal. It looks like one of those trees that large mariposas perch on. Almost an entire half of the tree is burned. Such large fire could only be caused by a large heap of fuel. And yet I couldnt see signs of hacking trees or shrubs around. The dried leaves may have been a lot.\n\nWhen fire burns leaves that are still attached to the body of a tree, they seem to die and decompose fast while they are still attached. How will this tree, still alive, get over this burning? Eventually, I think the tree will lose them. And from them new leaves should grow. The branches don't look burned like the leaves.\n\nFor some reason, this sight reminds me of Thoreau's mistake of burning an entire portion of a forest by mistake.\n\nI hear high pitched sounds of birds behind me. Then they stopped.\n\nI know I may be different from Thoreau and Dillard. Thoreau performed an experiment that also was literally a performance and he fictionalized his book. He wasn't true entirely. So is Dillard.\n\nDo I have then to do the same. To experience these transcendental moments and show through my writing that I have experienced them.\n\nWhat kind of nature writing appeals to me? All the more reason why I need to understand this genre and contextualize what I want to do in it.\n\nEssay idea: People are so unused to seeing someone walk.\n- a young man stopped and asked me if I needed a lift.\n- An old man that didnt talk that much had to stop and ask me why i dont ride my bike\n- Another old man thought I was drunk and deep in thought\n- Many times I was asked where I was going\n- Some friends who know me would say exercise?\n\nSo people think that the only acceptable reasons for walking are going to somewhere, exercising. If you are not doing it for exercise you are either drunk or in need of help.\n\nThis alolong is too small as if it was built for a dwende or something. I'm not sure what it is built for",

But somewhere southwest, large rain clouds are forming.\n\nPerhaps it is difficult to get to know flora and fauna, to start and build a relationship with them without naming them and getting to know them better. Biology and its branches is the conversation, satisfies our desire to know the story of those around us who dont speak our language. That is why Thoreau and Dillard cared about biology, not just poetry. It was as if through biology, they were able to get to know their subject matter closer and thus flow poetry about them more easily.\n\nThe sound if the palm leaves shaking is like water falling.\n\nThe view of the creek from above the neverending bridge is neverending beauty. It there ever is a curator of rocks, then this was curated. At 4 pm, the rocks are photographic. The light that pierces the canopy of trees touches the rocks gently. And the water sparkles from afar.\n\nThe water flows fast along the rocks. A mini rapids. Then its vigor lessens as it reaches the part of the creek, below the bridge itself, which is deeper, rockless. Here the waters rest. As if it was home.\n\nOccassionally, the water crumples. Either something from above falls or something from below moves. Whatever falls I do not see. Whatever moves below will be mystery.\n\nEverything is silent if not for the birds that pass by. Also invisible above the trees.\n\nThis kapok is unlike the cotton i use at home. Silky. It feels like one of the comforters I used in Baguio. The seed around which it is wrapped feels like a dried corn seed. It looks like it. A dark brown one. It takes on the smell of whatever it lands into. Now that I held it in my hand, they smell the same. I remember Doji's fur with it. It looks like it. As if someone cut the hair of one big doji from heaven and fell down from the sky (tell it this way: state an observation about kapok, say Doji's story first then reveal the metaphor about the big Doji in the sky).\n\nSome red bugs are attracted to a certain small plant that looks like a clover. Actually they are orange bugs. The ones I saw over the clover-like plants are infants. They grow large. They look like orange versions of that insect that stings strongly back at Pangasinan. These bugs come together under the leaves of these small plants.\n\nFrom here towards irri housing, the creek can be heard but difficultly seen. The leaves are thick. But it flows strongly, you can hear it.\n\n[[poems/bawat dahong namamaalam]]\n\nAn unknown bird flies by and vanishes behind a tree\n\nAnd then I heard sonic roaring\nA thin sheet of cloud\nA white line traversing the sky\n\nThe unknown bird\n\nWhat if I spend the entire day just looking at the sky?

    "content": "\nThe ultimate goal is to live well. But what does that even mean? To live well simply means to live intentionally, that is, to know how we want to live and to live accordingly.\n\nLiving well is a large project then, with smaller projects:\n1. To know your intention.\n2. To fulfill that intention.\n\nThere is no need for a deity in this initial framework. A need for deity only arrives depending on how one articulates one's intention.\n\nThere is, therefore a path that one goes through before the living of the intention, and that is the path that leads to an articulation of what one wants. Now this path requires knowledge about the world and more importantly about yourself. If you are a solipsist, then the two are one and the same.\n\nThese things never end:\n- Learning about the world\n- Learning about yourself\n- Setting your intentions\n- Getting them\n\nThey happen all the time. We cannot escape them. The only difference between people is that some are more intentional about these things than others.\n\nWhen transitioning from unintentional living to intentional living, the question then is this:\n- Do I already know the world and myself enough so as to set an intention?\n\nIn my part, I believe so yes. It is incomplete though. It will never be complete. But I am not completely clueless. I do know what makes me happy, what makes me feel positive.\n\nTake note, that none of these necessitate that one saves the world. No. This framework is neutral. It can be used both by the ambitious and the most unambitious.\n\nWhy am I using Thoreau as a model even if we seem to have totally different goals?\n\nA lot of times, I feel like a clueless lost foreigner no castaway in this world and I didn't even have a say about it. I didn't choose my existence. I know some supernaturalists would say they chose their existence even before they became human, but even if that is true, it couldn't escape the infinite regress that is did you also chose the existence of that which chose your existence? And so on.\n\nI am perfectly comfortable with the idea that none of this was my choice. And yet, here I am, now that someone else chose for me to exist, with too many choices before me. Perhaps the most fundamental of all those choices, a matter of life and death, is: Should I just kill myself (since I didn't chose this anyway) or should I go on living even so?\n\nKilling myself is of course the easiest choice. It will all be over and I don't even have to type anymore letters. But my biology seems programmed to make acting on this choice difficult, even if it is becoming clearer as the days pass that there is no inherent meaning in life. My biology is preprogrammed to avert pain. But perhaps more importantly, something within me seems to seek two things: happiness and meaning. I realize that even if I didn't choose to be here and even if life is inherently meaningless, I have the ability to enjoy it and make it a great ride anyways.\n\nBut none of these makes the ride any easier.\n\nA lot of times I feel that life is hard and I am reminded of that unfair fact that I didnt chose to be here. I reason that that existent who chose that I live (sometimes I blame my parents, but I now know that even them had no control over my existence), should have the responsibility to do all of this. He should provide me with the manual to live. If I was a Christian, everything would have been easier. I have the Bible and many fellow believers who will get me through it all. But I am not. And so I am left with this quest to DIY my life. From the ground up.\n\nTo create my own manual. Which is tricky because this manual never seem to end and while you are creating it you are already living it. It is an ever updating ever changing document.\n\nAnd so there is no big vision.\n\nThe only vision I know is to go through life and choose positively istead of commiting suicide and to make it an enjoyable and meaningful existence as I can. That's it.\n\nStudying, living, writing, connecting. These are all meant to help me go through life and choose life every single day over death. This is even true to me given the depression.",

Although I might need to explore the possibility of photography improving my philosophical practice.\n\nPhotography is not integral to philosophy if I still treat philosophy as this academic intellectual theory-only exercise.\n\nBut if I take philosophy as a way to deepen life both happiness and meaning, then photography takes on a different function. It becomes integral to the philosophical practice.\n- I can take a philosophical thought and look for a photo to represent it.\n- I can use photography in combination with walking to deepen my relationship with place and Nature.\n- I can use it simply to elevate moments like I do with poetry.",

There are aspects of human life that resist supply and demand. These things reside in the gift economy. And this is where doing something you love vs. doing something for money could have a clear difference.\n\nObviously, some things we love can absolutely make money for us because they are highly valued by others and the economy. But no one can deny that certain things are important, and have to be done, but are not currently valued well in the economy or whose value in the exchange economy will come in the future (say the works of Van Gogh).\n\nAnd so, my problem is defining whether what I want to dedicate my life to is indeed part of the exchange economy and can be valued well or not. If not, will I still continue doing it? How will I support myself materially and financially while doing it?\n\nMain skill: philosophizing\nSecondary skill: writing beautifully\n\nOther skills\n- Poetry\n- Photography\n- Web design and development",

We didn't chose this life but someone (chance, the universe, the laws of the universe) gifted it. This life is a gift experience. It might feel like a thrown experience at first, but once we interpret life as befriending existence, we might also start interpreting it as a gift, unwanted but given. And so everythin that flows from this state of giftedness can be said to come from a gift or has an element of gift.\n\nWhy did I cry?\n\nIsn't this idea that things are gifts connected to why I feel strongly appreciative and grateful for the little things.

The larger that is the closer the relationship.\n\nOne of Hyde's claims is that gifts strengthen relationships. This is something I want to question. In the internet, there are lots of free stuff, but I do not create that bond among those who give them for free.\n\nPerhaps it is useful to differentiate between classic gift communities and modern ones. A classic gift community is local and smaller.\n\nI don't think I am still a purely anarchocapitalist. Capitalism was a newer invention. We had more primitive ways of exchange. I am partial that we need both and perhaps a balancing regimes. But I do not know how to best do that without compromising individual freedom.\n\nThe transition of komun to titled lands is an illustration of the transition of gift economies to exchange economies.

Minimum because we don't want to exhaust every single agreement possible and we want to give a chance for other members to air what they want. But we can't start completely from scratch (because some values are already existent, we just have to start putting it to paper).

You have to feel at peace with that.\n\nAuthor **Rebecca Solnit** on growing whole rather than growing up:\n\n\"Growing up, we say, as though we were trees, as though altitude was all that there was to be gained, but so much of the process is growing whole as the fragments are gathered, the patterns found. Human infants are born with craniums made up of four plates that have not yet knit together into a solid dome so that their heads can compress to fit through the birth canal, so that the brain within can then expand. The seams of these plates are intricate, like fingers interlaced, like the meander of arctic rivers across tundra.\n\nThe skull quadruples in size in the first few years, and if the bones knit together too soon, they restrict the growth of the brain; and if they don't knit at all the brain remains unprotected. Open enough to grow and closed enough to hold together is what a life must also be. We collage ourselves into being, finding the pieces of a worldview and people to love and reasons to live and then integrate them into a whole, a life consistent with its beliefs and desires, at least if we're lucky.\"\n\n_Source:_ [_Recollections of My Nonexistence_](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/n4uwgvze7nuvh85on7wux/z2hghnholond7nip/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNBMGNwTWM=)",

    "title": "2022 Annual Review",
    "content": "\n![[files/foggy_freedom_park.jpg]]\n\nIn my [[My 2021 Annual Review]], I implemented a new process:\n\n1. I identified the life areas I will review. I used the following names back then: [[thoughts/life management system]], physical health, mental health, relationships, sustenance, life work.\n2. On each life area, I review my goals from last year and check whether or not I accomplished them and why.\n3. Then, I share the other goals and projects that emerged last year in that area.\n4. Finally, I share my new goals in each area.\n\nAt the end of that process, I set the following intentions (crossed-out goals were achieved):\n\n- ~~I have articulated my purpose, values, and big-picture vision for my life to make it easier for me to make decisions.\n- ~~I have established a better sleeping habit (eight hours a day from 11 PM to 7 AM).\n- I have established a healthy, sustainable, time-efficient, and cost-effective nutrition system to improve my overall well-being.\n- My throat has completely healed.\n- I have further tapered my sertraline dosage to 1/4 pill a day.\n- I have transformed my simple abode into a welcoming home for the important people in my life—people who I invite for meaningful and transformational conversations and camaraderie.\n- I have helped my partner be accountable for her goal of saving for her emergency fund.\n- I have supported my partner in becoming her healthiest self.\n- I have articulated for myself clearly what kind of people I want to bring into my life and inner circle.\n- I have proactively searched for my ideal people and nurtured relationships with them.\n- ~~I helped reunite my entire family at least once this year.\n- ~~I have implemented a budgeting system to use every month, while I haven’t yet improved my financial strategy.\n- I have reevaluated my understanding, values, and general philosophy of money and the material world.\n- ~~I have reevaluated my editing work and decided whether to improve my editing skills or learn a new skill altogether.\n- ~~I have reevaluated whether to outsource my editing work .\n- I have found a second source of stable income online.\n- ~~I have invested in high-risk, high-reward investment instruments.\n- I have learned Linux and considered an open-source lifestyle.\n- ~~I have studied web design and created a new minimum-viable design for vinceimbat.com.\n- ~~I have studied web development to apply the new design for vinceimbat.com.\n- ~~I have learned to code.\n- I have continued translating a sizable amount of Thoreau’s journal quotes.\n- ~~I have built a website for my Thoreau translations.\n- I have established a habit of reaching out and conversing with my ideal audience: followers, peers, and mentors.\n- I have researched individuals who asked “How to Live?” and studied how they study, live, share, connect, and facilitate their ideas to others.\n- I have clearly articulated my Talahardin system using inspiration from Zettelkasten, the Evergreen note-taking system, and BASB.\n- I have designed a beta version of an app for my Talahardin.\n- ~~I have planned, performed, and written about at least one long philosophical walk.\n\nThe list above could have easily captured what 2022 was for me. But it doesn’t. I feel a mixture of shame and sadness as I look at it. I carried over some of these goals from 2021, yet I have not given them the attention they are asking of me. They still need to be fulfilled. A problematic question now confronts me: Do I still want these goals? Perhaps I still do; it’s just that I don’t have enough time last year to cover them all. I am still trying to figure out what happened here.\n\nIn an ideal world, I should have achieved all of these goals. But I don’t live in such a world. What happened in 2022 was far more than what I expected. Here is a narrative of what transpired in what is easily the best yet the most challenging year of my long walk (Note: I feel this with almost every year that passes).\n\n![[files/fisherman-silhouette.jpg]]\n\n## January\n\nI spent the first weeks of 2022 in study mode. I finished reading and taking notes on the book *[[a philosophy of walking - gros|A Philosophy of Walking]]* by Robert Gros. This beautifully written reflection on the meaning and uses of [[thoughts/walking]] helped me understand the simplest mode of travel. I also re-read the article [[The Moderate-Minded Writer - Nisbet|\"The Moderate-Minded Writer\"]] by Matthew Nisbet and began studying [[Thich Nhat Hanh]]’s work through the website of [Plum Village](https://plumvillage.org/).\n\nSince it is the beginning of the year, I also conducted my [[Annual review]], improving my process. One of my goals this year was to improve the design of my main website (vinceimbat.com) to improve how I share my work, so I also started learning web design and development. Along the way, I realized that there was so much to learn, so I created a temporary site so I could continue to publish even while learning to code. To practice, I chose a smaller project: a website for my [[Translating my favorite Thoreau journal entries|Thoreau translations]]. I named the site [Kaliskis na Ulap](https://kaliskisnaulap.com/) and used Hugo to build it. Through this project, I applied what I learned from the full-stack web development course I bought from Udemy.\n\n![[files/dog.jpeg]]\n\n## February\n\nI started my birth month by publishing the first issue of [[Uman]], my newsletter that features monthly updates on my life and projects. After publishing it, I continued studying Thich Nhat Hanh. I particularly like his Understanding → Compassion → Happiness sequence ([[Understanding leads to compassion]]) and his distaste for ideologies.\n\nI also started re-reading *[[Transcend — Kaufman|Transcend]]* by Scott Barry Kaufmann. It was a book I started the year before but never finished. Since one of my goals this year was to articulate my purpose, values, and vision, I decided to return to it. Through *Transcend*, I learned that [[My top three sources of self-actualization]] were continued freshness of appreciation, truth-seeking, and purpose.\n\nIn addition, I researched what existing fields of knowledge combined contemplation and philosophizing and where among these fields I could position myself. My hopes rose after I discovered [[Ran Lahav]]'s [[Deep philosophy]] but later lost interest after I found that it puts a heavier emphasis on contemplation over philosophizing and that its epistemology favors experience over reason. This prompted me to read about the differences between rationalism and empiricism ([[rationalism vs empiricism]]).\n\nIt was also a month filled with web development projects. First, I continued studying web development, specifically HTML. I then discovered and implemented a solution to use a custom domain name for my notes in Craft, which I also used for my collection of Thoreau translations. Lastly, I decided to pull the trigger and migrate this website (vinceimbat.com) from WordPress to Hugo.\n\nRelationships-wise, I celebrated my birthday with a small group of friends, went home to the province to bond with cousins, attended an emotional wedding of two dear friends, and experienced the power of family as we faced a family member's health issue.\n\n## March\n\nI spent most of March thinking about the question, “What motivates us humans?” This question was in line with my research on [[thoughts/purpose]] and how I can better articulate it.\n\nI was interested in the conscious or unconscious reasons behind our actions. Psychology holds most of the answers to this question, so I stayed there for most of the month. However, I also reviewed philosophical answers. Specifically, I read and thought about the meaning of life. After combining insights from my readings in psychology and philosophy, I decided that, at the time being, my minimum viable purpose will be to self-actualize and transcend (i.e., to fulfill all my needs for security so that I could grow as a person and live my life in the service of humanity). This could change as I deepen my understanding of purpose and human motivation.\n\nWhile thinking about these things, I articulated the difference between meaning and purpose ([[Purpose vs Meaning]]) and wrote a very fruitful note on the relationship between nihilism and approaching life with humor ([[Approach life with humor]]). Inspired by my thinking about purpose and motivation this month, I realized I needed a more systematic way of tackling my goals. Through a journaling session, I wrote a draft of an outline on [[How to build a life management system]] implementation.\n\nMarch also featured several good walks:\n- a walk around Baguio for the first time since the pandemic,\n- my first walk inside Makiling Botanic Gardens,\n- discovering what would be my favorite trail along Matic-Matic–Maronong Road,\n- walking with my cousin and her fiance in Baguio,\n- and a solo walk at Yellow Trail.\n\nAside from walks, this month was also a month of travels. I went to Baguio to see my nephew and nieces for the first time in two years. I also traveled with some friends to San Nicolas and saw Taal up close (after it blew up some ashes!). I also joined my partner's family for an outing at Calayo, Nasugbu, Batangas.\n\n![[files/Kapok.jpg]]\n\n## April\n\nApril started with me contemplating my inevitable mortality. My contemplation led me to the realization that what is truly important in life are not the peak experiences but the [[Plateau experiences]]. The value of plateau experiences comes only after several brushes with death and suffering—experiences that make one wiser.\n\nThe connection between plateau experiences, death, and wisdom is as follows: When one wants to [[See things as they really are]], driven by curiosity and truth-seeking, one quickly realizes that everything is fleeting. This realization of the fleetingness of life then leads to more intentional living: one wants to make the most out of this short precious life.\n\nThinking about my life's fleetingness led me to ask myself what I wanted to do with the time I had left. The answer that came to me was that I wanted to write a book. I spent a considerable amount of time this month thinking about what kind of book to write and realized that I wanted to give birth to the following:\n\n\u003ebeautiful non-fiction books with photographs that combine personal narratives, philosophical thinking, cultural references, and historical descriptions, all situated in a specific geographical location.\n\nTo facilitate this project, I wanted to manage better the intermediate packets that could lead to writing a book. Thus, I transferred my notes from Craft to Obsidian.\n\nAfter setting up my notes, I began compiling a reading list of books and essays about place and nature that discuss what it means to live and draw resources from history, culture, science, philosophy, and every possible source. This led me to writers who were influenced by Thoreau, such as [[Annie Dillard]] and [[Edward Abbey]]. While reading all of these books about nature, a common practice among the authors emerged: Everyone described specific moments of profound observation of particular phenomena in nature. Because of this, I was inspired to go back to writing field notes during my walks, which I rewrite as vignettes in my journal.\n\nMeanwhile, I sent my blackout poems to be included in the Tuloy-Daloy exhibit, visited the Rizal Shrine for the first time, did my second hike to Mt. Makiling, traveled to Baguio City with my partner, and, finally, got my family together for the first time after two years.\n\n![[files/poor-boy-feeds-cats.jpeg]]\n\n## May\n\nIn May, I continued incorporating narratives into my digital garden. As I did this, I began thinking deeper about my writing life. I read [[thoughts/diy mfa by pereira|DIY MFA]] by Gabriela Pereira. One of my most significant writing achievements this month was narrativizing [[uman/004]].\n\nAs I progressed in writing, so did I in walking. I decided to improve my walking by increasing the time I spent outdoors in the afternoon. The more time I spend walking, the more chances I could have of catching something worth writing about. Extending my walking time led me to write longer, more beautiful field notes, which convinced me to relaunch [[Lilim]]. I published three issues of Lilim in May. It was during one of these walks that I serendipitously discovered the story of the [[in search of the internment camp in los baños|LB internment camp]], which I wrote about in [[Lilim 30 - Where Grass Once Turned Crimson]]. After reading about the story at the UPLB library, I spent an entire afternoon tracing the possible boundaries of the camp. During this walk, the draft of the poem [[poems/baker hall]] came to me.\n\nThe other walks I did this month were a walk at Lopez Quezon, around town, in one of the fishponds at Sta. Teresa, and at Santino's Farmville. I also had my second Makiling hike this month.\n\n![[files/dog-by-lake.jpg]]\n\n## June\n\nIn June, I walked from Los Baños to San Pablo, passing by the towns of Bay and Calauan along the way. It was my first multi-day walk; the second day I spent going around Sampaloc lake and visiting Bunot lake. While walking towards San Pablo, the difficulty of the walk, which I think owes more to rookie mistakes than the trail itself, made me ponder why I was doing the walk in the first place. I did the walk early this month, so I considered a lot about my motivations for walking the entire month. I journaled about it, thought about it on my next walks, and wrote a whole Lilim article on it ([[Lilim 29 - Why Walk?]]).\n\nThe walk also encouraged me to return to photography. I wanted to take good photos and edit them better during the walk, so I decided to improve my photography skills. This education extended even after the walk. I created a systematic, custom-made photography learning roadmap to organize my learning.\n\nAfter doing photography and walking for almost a month, I felt the urge to return to my foundation: philosophy and contemplation. I reminded myself that my walks and photos would be more meaningful if I am more intentional about them, that is if I use them to deepen my sense of meaning. To facilitate this meaning-making, I continued to sharpen my writing this month. I continued marinating myself in narratives, which helped me elevate my experiences while walking.\n\nAnother highlight of June was ordering, unboxing, and reading *[[Kissa by Kissa — Mod|Kissa by Kissa]]* by Craig Mod. I read the book in two sittings and learned a lot about walking, books, and photography—stuff I could use in my work.\n\n![[files/savia_birthday.jpg]]\n\n## July\n\nThis month, I spent a huge amount of time thinking about Thoreau. I studied his medium (the romantic excursion) and his quest to live his unique version of [[transcendentalism]]. More importantly, I studied his philosophical stance, which showed how different he is from me. Reading about Thoreau's quest inspired me to think about [[thoughts/my quest|my own quest]]. A huge part of this quest is the work that does not involve others, just myself. [[The writing I do in private is my most important writing]]. This writing is philosophical as it is meant to help me make sense of and understand my life and the world.\n\nI spent more time thinking about the kind of philosophy that I want to practice, and this led me to [[thoughts/lyrical philosophy]] per [[thoughts/edward mooney]]. This research on lyrical philosophy introduced me to [[thoughts/henry bugbee]] and, later on, [[Ordinary language philosophy]], specifically the work of [[thoughts/ludwig wittgenstein]]. My research on philosophy sharpened the kind of writing I want to produce. I want to create artifacts of writing around universal subject matters, which are place-based and use the [[romantic excursion]] as their device.\n\nThis month, I also worked on preparing a few poems to be sent to TLDTD for potential publication. The experience was very instructional. On photography, I created a photography learning roadmap that I would follow once I am ready to return to photography. On walking, I published a couple of Lilim issues, and while walking with my father and mother for the first time in a long time, I was reunited with Tita Sabel, a Deaf woman who took care of me when I was a baby.\n\nLastly, I modified how I prioritized goals. I created a comprehensive list of life goals and divided it into five primary focus goals and an extensive list of what is left called an “avoid-at-all-cost list.”\n\n![[files/shorty.jpg]]\n\n## August\n\nIn August, I went deeper into understanding how to incorporate lyrical philosophy into my writing by studying Henry Bugbee and his work, particularly *[[thoughts/the inward morning by bugbee|The Inward Morning]]*, which I wrote [[my commentaries on the inward morning by bugbee|commentaries]] about. Responding to his epistemology, I began valuing my fieldnotes better and giving them a specific category in my notes garden (\"[[Seeds]]\"). I also explored the work of [[andrew j. brown|Andrew J. Brown]]. Through these readings and explorations, I began looking closer at the religious nature of my work, and I faced head-on something that I was unconsciously avoiding: accepting that I am still engaged in religious activity and my past religious life has several things to teach me about living my current life.\n\nIn writing, I published one Lilim issue and several walk vignettes in draft form. I also received good news from [TLDTD](https://tldtd.org/) that my poem Gawat and its translation Tagsalat will be published in their Issue No. 5.\n\nThe main project that occupied me this month was transitioning my website into a digital garden using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and combining all my notes and blog posts into a single ecosystem where writings grow from seeds to [[seedlings]] and eventually [[Evergreens]].\n\n## September\n\nThis month, I spent the majority of my days thinking about money and how it relates to the life I want to live. I read the book *[[ynab|You Need a Budget]]* and then applied it by creating my budget, helping my partner create hers, and building our couple fund budget for our second month living together. We needed a system that could help us talk about money easily, and we found the YNAB system and app really helpful.\n\nWhile budgeting, I realized I needed to earn more money to retire earlier than the traditional retirement age. However, I was no longer willing to increase my working hours at my freelance job (editing). It became clear that if I wanted to improve my earnings, I needed to start a source of income closer to my passions. While thinking about this, I encountered the [[Career capital theory]] by [[Cal Newport]], which argues that if I want an ideal career, I need to develop a rare skill in exchange for it. I felt an intuitive reservation about the theory because it treats everything we do like something to be exchanged and treats careers like competition. This made me remember that [[Some important work have to be done even if they are not profitable]]. I remembered gift economics and decided to spend the remaining days of September reading the book *[[the gift - hyde|The Gift]]* by Lewis Hyde.\n\nIn other news, I went on two dates with friends: one in Pagsanjan and another at Las Piñas. I also celebrated my third anniversary with my partner, adopted a new cat, and rescued a kitten.\n\n![[files/Rem-Tanauan.jpg]]\n\n## October\n\nI started October intending to do a creative reset. After re-reading *Steal Like an Artist,* I decided to publish [The Long Walk (TLW)](https://vinceimbat.substack.com/) on Substack. The [[TLW 1 - A Philosophical Family Tree|first issue]] was released on October 9, 2022, and it shared the highlights of my mental and physical walks. I was able to publish two more issues on [[TLW 2 - The Inward Morning|16]] and [[TLW 3 - Our Invisible Walden|23]]. The issues contained highlights of my reading of *The Inward Morning*, the foreword of *[[Kapag Natagpuan Kita = Once I Find You — Rofel Brion|Kapag Natagpuan Kita]]*, and *[[thoughts/living philosophy by edward mooney|Living Philosophy]]*. The issues showed how I started building my philosophical family tree. It also presented my deepening appreciation and integration of poetry into my philosophical practice, culminating in the book launch of *Saglit*, where I met [[contacts/rofel brion]] at Casa San Pablo.\n\nMeanwhile, Carillon came into our lives, Benjie and I started a photography project together, and Lea and I went home to Pangasinan to spend two days at the beach.\n\nThings were going well until we were all struck by the sudden death of my best friend, [[contacts/rem tanauan]]. Rem's death forced me to look at my life and work and has reoriented my priorities into helping the people that Rem left move on. I am also called to protect Rem's private and public writings and get to know him more through this. I am also finally committing to mastering poetry.\n\n![[files/Tanay-mountains.jpg]]\n\n## November\n\nRem's death made me closer to my community. Thinking about the meaning of community made me realize the importance of having a metaphysical and epistemological home that I could return to as I practice tolerance and compassion toward others who do not believe my fundamental beliefs. This led me to [[metaphor of the well vs. metaphor of walking|the metaphor of walking and the well]], which also applies to poetics and living in general.\n\nWhile I contemplated community, I helped a friend translate the foreword of her upcoming book, walked with some friends at Makiling Botanic Gardens, and shared space with others at the Ginhawa Breathing Space event at Tanay, Rizal. There, I walked around the Hermitage and Organic Gardens (HOGAR) of the Institute for Consecrated Life in Asia (ICLA) and did a hike to Mt. Kulis with my partner and some old and new friends. The trip helped me grieve Rem and provided some much-needed inspiration to write a few poems and some issues of TLW.\n\nAfter the trip, I focused on contributing to a small group of Rem's friends who wanted to preserve his works and continue his legacy. I also read the book *[[designing your life - burnett and evans|Designing Your Life]]* by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans to provide some ideas on how I could incorporate the new insights I had about my life work after Rem's death and think better about adjustments I wanted to do in my work life.\n\n## December\n\nI mainly spent the last month of the year thinking about my sources of income. I wanted to create a livelihood system (as I like to call it) that is both resilient and encourages my transition toward more satisfying work. At present, I support my art through freelance editing. I realized that editing no longer provides the same fulfillment it once did. Also, I needed to introduce multiple income streams to my system to create a safety net.\n\nI contacted a previous employer and asked if they had any project they could use a hand with. Fortunately, they have a writing project and offered me a trial run. I also started writing podcast show notes again.\n\nMy partner brought up the idea of me helping her with her systems. Since this is a potential business idea I have been thinking about for a long time, I gladly accepted the challenge. I spent the last week of the month going back to my thoughts on how to build a minimum viable life management system and creating a prototype course for her. We are currently doing the course together, with me coaching her step-by-step. So far, this project has provided me with helpful ideas on how I might proceed with this endeavor.\n\nWhile working on my partner’s LMS, I also took the opportunity to improve my own LMS. I redesigned my daily routine to accommodate better sleeping habits and incorporated the Pomodoro app Forest into my morning routine.\n\nThis month, I wrote a few poems and several poem drafts and released two TLW issues, the last of which involved a narration of my realizations from watching stars for over a week while at Cablong. In addition, I finalized a plan for improving and maintaining Rem’s websites, which I shared with our small group.\n\nWhile at Cablong, I also had several good walks. My favorites were walking to Banaoang, discovering a heavily graffitied house, and walking under a full moon.\n\nThis month also allowed me to nurture my relationships and start new ones. I began a friendship with some Pangasinan writers or kumukurits who, like me, are doing their best to help preserve the dying Pangasinan language. I also attended a freelancers’ event with my partner, where I got to meet new and old friends.\n\nMy holidays were beautifully silent. I spent Christmas and New Year at my apartment in Los Baños with my partner and our cats. During the dead week between Christmas and New Year, we met with three friends. But that’s about it. My 2023 started with me hugging my partner as we looked out the window, watching a fireworks display that lasted just about five minutes.\n\n\\***\n\nIn 2023, I have two big goals: (1) to establish a more resilient livelihood system that encourages me to transition to doing work that I enjoy more and (2) to start a book project (possibly about walking in Los Baños). I have other goals, but they serve different support roles for these two. I do not doubt that other important goals will emerge along the way. Hopefully, I will be ready to face them when they do.\n\n![[files/dancing_flowers.jpg]]",

    "content": "## Summary\n\nI started this month doing my annual review. While doing this, I also assisted Lea in performing her own annual review as part of setting up her minimum viable life management system. After finishing my annual review, I finished the trial run of updating the Bookbright OVIC overviews and accomplished the Proofreading Pal application process.\n\nWhile I engaged in very little philosophizing this month, I did caught several good insights including an insight about why commitments should be celebrated and why altruism is important. Most of the writing I did this month was journaling and poetry. I had a very deep experience looking at the moon at Aglibut Ave during one of my walks that I wrote a poem draft about it. Using insights I learned from Billy Collins' poetry masterclass, I also edited some of my poems, which I later sent to TLDTD.\n\nMeanwhile, Benjie and I continued LBLP, and I shared my favorite photos of 2022, which received positive feedback. The best walk I did this month was my walk with Lea to Dampalit Falls. Someone from IG also reached out to me expressing their gratitude for the work I did in my website, which has been helpful for them in building their own life management system.\n\nThis month was filled with time spent reconnecting with my relationships. During this month, Lea and I helped Champy go through solving her dental problems. I also got into a three-hour call with Megs and Cams and joined Tuloy-Daloy in creating an urn for Rem made of mud. Lea and I also met Rio and Mac at San Pablo. Later this month, I went home to Pangasinan to attend Tito Lito's funeral and reconnect with Jay Vee and our friends. After this, I bonded with my cousins in Binmaley.\n\nIn between all of these activities, I spent time getting more clarity on what source of income to look for. I read Pivot to clarify my runway and strengths. Then I tried applying at editing and academic writing platforms, trying out things and feeling if they are a fit. To add income, I also sold some unused books.\n\n## Studies\n\n- [[Success is arriving at something that reorganizes how you think or feel]]\n- [[The different ethical philosophies represent different modes of being]]\n- [[Commitments should be celebrated]]\n- [[Altruism encourages trust and courage]]\n- [[Creations can cross the exchange economy to the gift economy and vice versa]]\n- Received Wilderness and the Heart.\n\n## Writing\n\n- I translated [[On Children - Gibran]] into Filipino.\n- I wrote a Facebook comment response about parenting.\n- In my journal, I wrote about the transgenerational trauma that we all share and recognized the progress I have made in two years to embrace who I really am and make space for that.\n- I journaled about the insight that insight is precious because it comes in unexpected moments and it comes only after repeatedly returning to the same problem or looking at writings that expand several months or even years.\n- I wrote [[poems/kalabian ed aglibut]]\n- I started watching [[Billy Collins]]' poetry masterclass and writing my notes in [[Billy Collins Teaches Reading and Writing Poetry]].\n- I edited the poem [[Today I Buried a Kitten]] using advice I learned from Billy Collins.\n- Editing poems and studying poetry helped me forget negative emotions.\n- I developed a poem: [[poems/wasak]]\n\n## Photography\n\n- Benjie initiated that we return to LBLP.\n- I shared my favorite shots of 2022 and my friends provided very positive and motivating feedback.\n\n## Walking\n\n- While walking, Lea and I came to the conclusion that it is the eliminatist tendencies that we should strive to let go. This is what creates problems both in mental and physical health.\n- I walked after getting an awesome haircut and it felt good.\n- Lea and I walked to Dampalit Falls. I wrote [[A walk to Dampalit Falls]].\n\n## Projects\n\n- I helped Lea setup her minimum viable life management system.\n\n## Others\n\n- Lea and I ate at Cadiz Pizza and ordered Cheesy Mushroom Pepperoni.\n- I tried the pares overload streetfood in front Star but thought it was overrated.\n\n---\n\n## Life Areas\n\n### Overseeing\n- I wrote [[2022 gratitude list]].\n- Reviewing some Uman issues I wrote to complete my gratitude list revealed to me patterns in my thinking throughout the year.

We decided that we needed to do this call at least once a month.\n- I helped improve Champy's dental health by bringing her to the vet, administering her meds, and arranging prophylaxis for her.\n- I joined Tuloy-Daloy in creating the urn for Rem at Maui and Yano's place at Batangas. Along the way, I bonded with Uwa, Abbey, and Kuya Iktoy. I also reconnected with my memories of my last date with Rem.\n- I visited Embi and Bevs and learned that Embi has already read Walden and has dreamt of living in the mountains.\n- Lea and I traveled to San Pablo. Our jeep ride was awesome. We saw Sampaloc Lake together. And we met Rio and Mac and had good food at Casa San Pablo.\n- I gave Shorty, Champy, and Poppy baths. Lea bathe Cari. Then I gave all of them Advocate.\n- I went to Tito Lito's wake and joined the funeral walk. I reconnected with Jay Vee, his family, and our common friends.

Through it, I learned that the nearest skill that I have that matched my values is really poetry and creative writing.\n- I sold some books and earned Php 980.\n- I started fixing the Acer laptop.\n- I reviewed Pivot. After reading Chapter 4 (Funding My Runway), I understood how much of my money could really fund my transition and identified when I should up my game of looking for a source of income.\n- I was able to ask Rom for advice.\n- I was able to tell Bevs about my situation and ask for ideas and leads.\n- I listedned to some helpful Fizzle Show episodes on MVI.\n- I started writing [[My Pivot Plan]].\n- I applied at Super Summary.\n- I realized that I needed to make money fast because my lack of a reliable source of income is already affecting my psyche.

    "content": "## Summary\n\nThe main areas I nurtured this month were sustaining and connecting. I did a new set of OVIC overviews and got paid for the trial run I did last month. I also landed a research ghostwriting gig, which Claire referred to me, and which I landed through an awesome cover letter, a decent enough discovery call, and an excellent writing test. Landing this job boosted my confidence. It was my first real win throughout this job search process, and with that it was already worth-it by itself. Doing the work also gave me a refresher on research writing, which will help me when I focus on editing academic writing. These two gigs gave me some sense of security and convinced me to use the free time I generated to focus on achieving consistency of income through freelance editing and writing. While looking for gigs, I also spent a considerable amount of time just brainstorming the ideal business setup I want. I read The Free Agent Ecosystem by Tiago Forte, which introduced me to some really important principles I plan to incorporate in my freelancing.\n\nIn terms of connecting, I spent time bonding with Camille and my cousins, realizing that in a few months, my relationships with my cousins will definitely change as they transition into marriage life. I also made my intention to establish a daily connecting practice through a personal CRM app. I discovered Clay and this moved me to reach out to people like Kleinifer Palma. This led to an unexpected reunion at Baguio with her and Gerald Bandonil. I also started chatting with Lovelle Almazar, a fellow editor in the Philippines. Also, I spent a simple birthday celebration with Lea, who gifted me with a hand and foot massage package. Speaking of massages, I had two body massages this month, something I wanted to do but never had since 2017 (?).\n\nIn other areas, it is still slow in the understanding department. I did enjoy reading Wilderness and the Heart, specifically the article: \"Answering the Call of the Wild: Walking with Bugbee and Thoreau\" by Daniel W. Conway and Things I Like About Christianity by Steve Patterson. I also wrote three poems and had a few walks.\n\n## Studies\n\nWhile working on an OVIC overview about the police abolition movement, I was reminded of anarchy and its belief on what is possible. It touched something within me, something that asks me, am I living based on what my heart knows is possible or have I given up and accepted the status quo?\n\nI wrote:\n- [[Over-attachment to an identity encourages close-mindedness]]\n- [[Breathing and acting are similar]]\n- [[Remembering the past is important]]\n\n## Writing\n- I wrote poems:\n\t- [[poems/diyad perya]] and its translation into Filipino\n\t- [[ang unang liwayway]]\n\t- [[Tunog]]\n\n## Photography\n\n## Walking\n- Walked from Matic-Matic to Cablong and gathered thoughts about simple living.\n- [[2023-02-12]]: I walked to Forestry via Grove. There were so many people that the walk was suboptimal. Things got better when I was reaching Forestry, particularly when I started hearing the birds and the insect sounds. While there, I realized  how important Nature is for my spirituality and well-being, but also that I am not spending enough time in it.\n\n## Projects\n\nDaily networking\n\n- I found Clay after researching a few personal CRMs.\n- I connected with Kleinifer Palma.\n\n[[Freelance Business Setup v1]]\n- Drafted a plan\n\nInclusion in the workplace v1\n- I learned how to write a freelance cover letter. I wrote one to apply for a gig that Claire sent it. It worked. The client messaged me.\n- Lea and I went live where she audited my LinkedIn profile.\n- I prepared and did my first ever discovery call (which turned out to be a job interview) and did it with flying colors.\n- I did a writing test and I passed it. I got the job.\n- I learned how to properly write a literature review\n- I learned how to write an annotated bibliography.\n\n## Others\n- Noticed Jupiter and Venus' alignment in February sky.            \n\n---\n\n## Life Areas\n\n### Overseeing\n- I finished processing all the remaining journal entries in [[2018-10 to 2019-10 Diary]]. I also fixed its index and that of the [[2018-07 to 2019 Diary]].\n\n### Restoring\n- Had my first massage in a long time at Footprints.\n- Had my second massage at North Haven Spa at Casa Vallejo. I tried their combo indigenous massage.\n- Had foot and hand spa at V Lounge Spa for my birthday. (Then had dinner at Cadiz Pizza.)\n\n### Connecting\n- Spent lunch with my extended family, including Bernice's fiance.\n- Had karaoke night with Migs and Cams.\n- I realized that in a few months, my relationships with my cousins will definitely change as they are transitioning into marriage life.\n- Champy had her prophylaxis successfully and Lea reported me everything.\n- Had dinner at Cafe Amaris with Cams, Migs, and Tito Francis. After which, I had deeper conversations with Migs and Tito Cams\n- Traveled to Baguio and joined my family for a buffet lunch at Cabalen. We then went to Burnham for the kids. I rode on the boat for the first time since I was a small kid.\n- Went to Volante at SM to meet Kleinifer and Gerald, friends I haven't seen in a decade and whom I never really hanged out with at college.\n- I connected with Lovelle Almazar.\n- I connected with Jamie Vidich and Goan.\n- Had a Valentine's date with Lea at Rocks and Tea. We played Sequence and liked it. We then went to the UP Fair, but spent most of our time lying down on the grass and staring up at the black sky.\n- Helped Lea address Carillon's health issue.\n- Lea and I walked to UP then had a date at Jollibee.\n\n### Sustaining\n- Continued applying for academic writing positions but realized I don't want to continue doing this kind of writing.\n- I applied at Writers.ph\n- I received payment for the OVIC trial run then received a new set of assignment. I finished the assignment this month.\n- I re-affirmed that the goal is to get to a consistent income as soon as possible by capitalizing on already profitable skills I have: writing, editing, and researching.\n\n### Creating\n\n---\n\n## Media Consumption\n\n### Books\n- Received a copy of A Humument.\n- I started re-reading Book Yourself Solid.\n- I started reading Wilderness and the Heart, specifically the article: \"Answering the Call of the Wild: Walking with Bugbee and Thoreau\" by Daniel W.

Thoreau noticed this and made comparisons between books written indoors vs outdoors. How is this possible though, and how can we describe the potential of walking in traversing liminal identies?\n\nWhat if this liminality is the new identity the new self. That there is no new self and what is only possible is new self becoming. I am still uncertain. But like I learned while being in between stories, uncertainty can be pleasurable.\n\nBeing in a liminal space makes one attentive, perhaps it is the feeling of scarcity, perhaps it is the feeling of unknown. Whatever the cause, we experience an unusual openness when facing dereliction. There is a void that needs to be filled, and everything is a candidate.\n\nThe neverending bridge as a parable of limen.\n\nEverytime we traverse a liminal space, we seem to open a third one. And so the question of whether liminal states ever end is a valid question.\n\nTraversing liminality through ambulatory autoethnography\n\nIs it coincidental that liminality is traversed through a movement that metaphorically fits what being in a liminal space is?\n\nIf am no longer a JW, and yet I am currently unaffiliated to no other church, am I a non-JW, an atheist or agnostic (liminal categories).\n\nI have a PWD card, but I don't seem to use it a lot. I don't commit to the identity. In almost all areas of my life, I exhibit hesitance. I am afraid to commit to anything. Perhaps this isn't fear, but a natural emotional reaction to being in limen.\n\nAs I am writing these words and making sense of my own state of limen, I am also in a new kind of limen.\n\nI realize that being in limen fits well with my personal preferences. I prefer being around people who are unsure, who are careful to conclude, who always leave room for doubt rather than those who are very sure of themselves. Again, I am unsure whether this preference is due to being in limen or a personality.",

    "content": "## Summary\n\nI spent the first week of March strengthening the concept of my client's research proposal on inclusion of people with disabilities. After delivering the final version of the draft, instead of jumping right into editing and proofreading study, I faced my fears and decided to do something for my art in the remaining days of the month even if I still didn't have a consistent flow of income. I decided to write an entry for the Ateneo National Writers' Workshop 20, which I sent on the last day of the month. After some deliberation, I decided to focus on how walking helps me traverse the psycho-socio-religious liminality I am currently in.\n\nIn between these two major projects, I spent some time performing a metalearning project to look for the best resources and create a customized curriculum for improving my editing and proofreading skills. I also did two batches of overviews for Boobkright. Lea and I also went to a few adventures. We celebrated her birthday through a picnic lunch at Freedom Park. Then we went to Enchanted Kingdom where I faced my fears and explored emotions I never knew I had.\n\nThroughout the month but particulary by the end, there were several occasions of bonding with our community. Benjie and Joji came to visit Los Baños and expressed desire to transfer here in the future. In addition, Lea and I went to Bal Bibal's Impression Workshop. We also attended the opening of Maui's solo exhibit, where I read my translation of A House Called Tomorrow by Alberto Rios and experienced flow while playing indigenous musical instruments. We then explored Elbi's hip-hop scene by watching Bevs' gig. Finally, we bonded with Kris Ann a couple of times.\n\nAfter extending my runway, I was also able to open potential website design and development projects with Ili Likhaan and Candent. Meanwhile, I also started tapering my meds down to 1/4 tab per night and I was generally okay.\n\n## Studies\n\nWrote:\n- [[Writing is walking is living]]\n\n## Writing\n\n- Revisited my translation for the Rios poem [[Isang Tahanang Tatawagin Nating “Bukas”]].\n\n## Photography\n\n- Took some decent photos during the Bal Bibal Workshop and Ili exhibit opening.\n\n## Walking\n\n- A walk to Freedom Park on March 3, made me realize that I needed days when I will just be in the present moment, not planning and thinking about securing my life, but just being there and living and not doing anything.\n- Walked at Pancho on March 7 and saw the moon over the mountains of Laguna.\n\n## Projects\n\n### Inclusion in the Workplace Research Proposal\n- I was able to deliver the first, second, and third drafts for the Inclusion paper successfully.\n- I was able to talk to Krys along the way effectively to incorporate all the feedback.\n- I was able to treat her well as a client.\n\nEditing and Proofreading Improvement\n- I continued doing metalearning to survey the best resources to improve editing and proofreadng skills.\n- I created the [[Annotated Bibliography of Resources for Editorial Freelancing]] to compile resources for this project.\n- I continued to refine my study plan and narrow down the resources I will be using.\n\nANWW20\n- I listened to podcasts and YT videos about autoethnogaphy.\n- Walked to Forestry and spent around 30 minutes sketching ideas for the [[Entry to ANWW20]] on my journal.\n- Learned how to format a paper in MLA and sent the paper to Ateneo.\n\nOverviews\n- I was able to update 11 new OVIC overviews.\n\n## Others\n\n- Ate at Crispy Nok.\n- Lea and I had dinner at Cadapan.\n\n---\n\n## Life Areas\n\n### Overseeing\n\n### Restoring\n\n- I started tapering my meds down to 1/4 setraline tab every night.\n\n### Connecting\n\n- Benjie and Joji visited Los Baños, so we had a picnic at Freedom Park together with Bevs, Embi, and Lea.\n- Ate at Dalcielo with Kris Ann and Lea.\n- Helped solve Champy's dental problems by bringing in Doc Ortiz to extract her teeth.\n- Lea and I celebrated her birthday through a picnic at Freedom Park.\n- While walking to Forestory on  March 3, Lea and I talked about how we can incorporate spirituality into our activities as a couple.\n- Spent a night with Bevs, Embi, Diwa, Ju, and Lea discussing Tungko, art, business, and personal problems.\n- Lea and I went to EK as my birthday gift to her. The trip helped me discover and keep in touch with emotions I didn't know I had.\n- Lea and I went to Bal Bibal's impression workshop.\n- Lea and I joined many other friends for the opening of Maui's solo exhibit at Sining Makiling.\n- Lea and I celebrated Kris Ann's birthday at Auntie Pearl's Pizza.\n- Lea and I went to Bev's gig at Jacque's and got acquainted with the LB hip-hop culture.\n\n### Sustaining\n\n- Continued working for SEP: 255, 256, 257, 258, 259\n- I had talked with Maui and Yano for a potential project to improve Ililikhaan's website.\n- I had a talk with Benjie for a potential project to improve Candent's website.\n\n### Creating\n\n---\n\n## Media Consumption\n\n### Books\n- [[Walking as a Way of Knowing - Amoroso]]\n\n### Articles\n\n- [Healing a Nation After a Season of Vitriol - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/us/politics/healing-a-nation-after-a-season-of-vitriol.html).\n\n### Podcasts\n\n- [A podcast episode interview with William Ury about resolving conflict](https://simonsinek.com/podcast/episodes/resolving-conflict-with-william-ury/)\n\n### Films\n\n- Allegiant\n- The Proposal\n- A Bad Moms Christmas\n- Selective Outrage\n\n### TV Series\n\n- Teenage Bounty Hunters\n- Cobra Kai\n- Never Have I Ever\n- Making a Murderer\n- Community\n- The Kominsky Method\n\n### Music\n\n- Jao Rogers\n- Jenn\n- Lucylle",

    "content": "## Summary\n\nThis month, I started seriously considering that my field was letters. Although I still see my work as an exploration of how to think, feel, and live better, I do these in the context of using beautiful words. I think this was affected by my recent achievements in writing.\n\nDespite being busy with client work, I would consider this month as a month of writing. I wrote five poems, mostly in their final forms. I read The Elements of Style, finally, and immediately felt its effect on how I write. I have also started reading On Writing Well, which is a powerful complement to it. But the biggest gift I received was the advice I got from Sir Rofel Brion, Froi, and Taks on how to approach the ANWW20. Their ideas were enough to make me feel relaxed and more confident in reading the works of my co-fellows.\n\nFroi read my essay and liked it: he said I would go far in walking and writing. He advised me to tweak the essay and send it to Palanca just to try. This I did, which became a very instructive experience. More than the skills I learned while doing this project, I am grateful for the realization that I have to confront my past life as a Jehovah's Witness more intentionally. I started doing this by journaling, walking, and watching the film Apostasy. This month, I was also able to send my first TLW email after 6 months.\n\nStill in writing, I contended with some difficult feelings about my family not showing interest in what I do. I was reminded by Keri Smith's words: I shouldn't expect my family to cheer me on in my art, especially now that we have grown far apart.\n\nThis month, I was sustained by the money I received from Candent and Ili. I learned how to work with clients and deliver what I promised. I also migrated Pathfinder's Commune to a free hosting provider and realized I want to commune with Rem through this blog soon.\n\nAlthough not as vibrant as last month, I still spent good times with friends and family. I particularly enjoyed cooking with friends in front of Freedom Park, spending time at Candent with Benjie and Joji, buying clothes with Lea at SM Calamba, and bonding with Dan and Kris Ann.\n\n## Studies\n\nWrote the following notes:\n- [[The artist's achilles heel]]\n- [[A life in letters]]\n- [[Articulate your purpose as self-transformation]]\n- [[When your family does not cheer your art]]\n- [[The poet's state of mind]]\n- [[Writing prose as a poet]]\n- [[The Very First Memory]]\n\nStudied Barry Lopez's work briefly.\n\nReally enjoyed this quote: [[The daily routine of a Danish aristocrat - Dillard]]\n\n## Writing\n\n### Poetry\n- [[Rambutan Road]]\n- [[On an afternoon walk I saw fireflies]]\n- [[poems/mais]]\n- [[poems/fog]]\n- [[poems/a midsummer rain in lb]]\n\nTranslation\n- [[Paano Maging Miserableng Artist]]\n\nDid a writing experiment by Bernadette Mayer involving listing familiar phrases that has stuck on me for years.\n\n## Photography\n\n## Walking\n\n- I discovered a new trail, the other branch of the NLAI walks that led me back to Rambutan Road.\n- Experienced walking in UPLB at pitch dark ([[Walking UPLB in pitch dark]]).\n- Walked to Tuntungin-Putho\n\nWrote:\n- [[Rewalking Baguio]]\n- [[Walking Mt.

I'm currently experimenting with walking as a method for living and writing.\n\nAs much as I want to focus on research and creation, I need to feed myself. Launching a Patreon is an experiment to test the following hypotheses:\n- the Filipino audience is ready to support its artists\n- It is possible to do creative work without the pressure of making money out of it\n- It is possible to do creative work outside trad institutions\n\nTool:\n- when I am walking, I jot down a thought. I want that thought to have all kinds of identity: exact place on the map and time it came.\n- Enacting the songlines in the time of the internet.\n- What I want is to generate a map based on these seeds.\n- This is using walking to generate insights -\u003e meaning of place -\u003e recreating landscape (the map created from this is your universe)\n\nIf I am interested in memory and walking then this naturally traverses history",

Nothing more.\n\nWhen I told papa that I have broken up with her, as he advised, but that I was feeling very low and tired and anxious, he just said, “Ontan ya talaga so nagagawa’d sararatan” (That’s really what happens with those things).\n\nI took what he said as a fact. I’ve never broken up with someone before. I was 19 years old. I have never been in a serious relationship. So, when we ended three months of secret phone calls every evening, I didn’t know what to expect. Since I didn’t have any experience, I believed my father.\n\nThese weird things I have been experiencing for almost three weeks already were what happens when we fall in love and abruptly end it—sleeping only two hours every night, waking frequently in the middle of the night, feeling tired the entire day, most probably because of the lack of sleep, a very low mood, as if a large gray cloud looms above my head wherever I go, circling thoughts, and this sudden desire to confess my sins, this overwhelming guilt.\n\nI am walking today to Kuya Keith’s house to confess for the very first time.\n\nSins that I’ve been hiding from the elders in the congregation for years were suddenly shouting inside my head, wanting to come out. Sins considered minor but still worthy of confession, according to religious rules, are now giving me a hard time.\n\nI called Kuya Keith, and told him I wanted to talk about something that was bothering me. He said his door is open anytime.\n\nIt was 4:00 in the afternoon, the sun still up in a cloudless March sky. The air was chilly.\n\nI was about to knock at Kuya Keith’s door when I realized…\n\nit was slightly open.",

    "title": "A Safe Place to Retreat To",
    "content": "I am not afraid to write in a new journal.\n\nWhy would I? If journaling brings fear, why would I do it? The point of journaling, at least for me, is to express myself in writing in a frictionless, fearless manner.\n\nA journal shouldn't be something that stresses me out. It becomes one if I treat it like something to \"show off\". For some people, journaling is their art form and their [journal pages](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/bulletjournal/) are something they show to the world. This works great for them and I find many of their works inspiring.\n\nHowever, this is something I prefer not to do—[if I can help it](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9qGbATBaR2/). I have [so much history with journaling](my-journaling-system-june-2018/) that prevents me from taking that path. A journal, for me, has always been the safest place I can be. And during times like these, I cling to it a lot, because even if I don't admit it to others (or to myself) often, I do am afraid right now.\n\nI've said things in my journals I won't tell anyone. Writing in them have sustained me emotionally for almost three years now since I started getting serious with them. With a daily journaling practice, I've become less anxious, less sad, and less afraid. Without this practice, I'll be more afraid than I am now.\n\nWhile my journals are also slowly transforming into flower beds for ideas I share in this blog (this post being an example), it will always be primarily a place of retreat. I feel calmer knowing that there is always a safe place I could run to when things get tough.\n",

    "title": "A Simple Process for Answering the Question: 'How to Live?'",
    "content": "\n![Lone Fisherman](Lone-Fisherman.jpg)\n\n\u003e How to live?\n\nThis is the question I feel like I have asked myself all my life. I know most people don't ask the question. But by not asking the question, they unknowingly (and dangerously) outsource their search for answers―to their parents, their teachers, or their religious leaders. This leads to \"business as usual\"―they live their lives according to what is handed to them by tradition or by what is socially acceptable.\n\nBut what is traditional and socially acceptable isn't always the best way for us to live. We have our own personality and preferences. So why do we want to do what other people―who have their own personalities and preferences―are doing?\n\nSometimes (or, perhaps, oftentimes), the answer boils down to this: we're just lazy to do the amount of work required for answering such important question and so we just take what's ready-made, what's handed down to us. Or worse, we're afraid of the consequences of learning about our personal truths.\n\nThis is an entire problem of its own, one that requires its own space for processing. But for those who have decided that the question of \"How to live?\" is a question they are ready and are brave enough to tackle, read on.\n\n## The Core Process is Simple\n\nAt its core, the process I have discovered on how to answer \"How to live?\" is actually very, very simple. It just involves three questions. Answer the three questions and you are way ahead of other people in your search.\n\nThe three questions are:\n\n1. How do I know what I know?\n2. What exists?\n3. Using my answers for #1 and #2, how should I act?\n\nThis process is so simple and so natural that we do it all the time.\n\nFor example, when you saw a flower and you picked it up, you just acted according to your answers to the three questions above automatically, without even stopping to ask and reflect on your answers!\n\n1. How do I know what I know? --\u003e \"I trust what I 'see'.\"\n2. What exists? --\u003e \"I see a flower. Therefore, a flower exists.\"\n3. Using my answers for #1 and #2, how should I act? --\u003e \"Knowing that a flower exists and seeing that I could pick it up, I pick it up.\"\n\nIt's that simple.\n\n\u003e How we decide to know what we know determines what we believe exists. And our knowledge about our knowledge and about what exists informs us about what we decide to do.\n\n## How a Simple Process Gets Complicated\n\nThis simple process only gets complicated when you start to entertain other important questions related to these three main questions.\n\nHow do I know what I know?\n\n- Are my senses reliable?\n- Does what I know ultimately come from a supernatural being?\n- Is what I know objective? Or is it subjective?\n\nWhat exists?\n\n- Does God exists?\n- Is their a soul?\n\nUsing my answers for #1 and #2, how should I act?\n\n- Is my action \"right\" or \"wrong\"?\n- How do I know what is \"right\" and \"wrong?\"\n\nFrom these additional questions arise complex answers from where entire religions, philosophies, and ideologies were constructed. These belief systems usually have similar answers to questions #3. Many want love and peace. But where they differ (and, therefore, disagree), are their answers to questions #1 and #2.\n\nA Christian and an atheist may both believe that people should act nonviolently towards each other. In this case, they reached the same conclusion in answering question #3. However, the two have \"mutually exclusive\" reasons for desiring nonviolence. The Christian is motivated by his belief in the accuracy of the knowledge he gets from the Bible (question #1), which teaches the existence of a living God (question #2) who wants his creation to reflect that. On the other hand, the atheist believes only what he sees (question #1) and, therefore, acts kindly towards other people not because a supernatural being instructed him to do so but simply out of fellow feeling towards those that he sees (question #2).\n\n## Everything Boils Down to the Three Questions\n\nBut no matter how complex a worldview is, it always boils down to the same three questions you almost automatically answer when you pick up a flower.\n\n1. You determine how you know what you know.\n2. You determine what exists.\n3. You use your knowledge of how you know what you know (1) and what exists (2) to determine how best to act.\n\nThat is how that elusive question of \"how to live?\" gets its answer.\n\nThat is how you will get your answer for yourself.\n",

This freedom is worth everything I gave up, which is perhaps the reason why I am so invested in the truth.\n- I take care of my mind and body more now. I no longer sacrifice a lot just for others.\n- I no longer feel guilty because of breaking some rules, moral code, or dogma.\n- I do writing more (journaling, essays), which is oo personal, I know, but something I neglected in those years while at church.\n- I have met dozens of people doing incredible things that inspire me—people I wouldn't have met if I was still at the church.\n\nI conclude that I actually have a good life now that I have to improve by noticing the [[Things I had in my past religious life I can incorporate in my current life]].\n\n# References",

    "content": "\n![Minimum Viable Worldview](minimum_viable_worldview_mvw.png)\n\nIn the past, I immersed myself in many business books. I chose to be a freelancer and freelancing was a pretty scary endeavor. It requires a lot of affirmation, inspiration, and instruction. In hindsight, I think reading a lot of business books while I freelanced was inevitable.\n\nLooking back at all the business books I read, I realized I wasted a lot of my precious time. Most were really just fluff and their advice often operated on a very shallow understanding of human life and society. In my view, income generation is only a subset of the bigger human pursuit of navigating the material world. And yet, most business books treat income generation as the \"be all and end all\" of human existence. People who sincerely want to learn \"how to make a living\" would be better off not reading any of these books.\n\nHaving said this, not all business concepts are useless. As I ventured into my intention to pursue a [[My 2017 annual review|self-directed study of philosophy]] this year, I struggled with a particular problem early on that reminded me of a concept I picked up from reading business books. This concept solved my problem and I think it is a useful tool for anyone starting a similar journey in life. In this post, I'll share the concept and how I applied it to my problem.\n\n## Metaphysics and Ethics\n\nAfter reading [[Square One — Patterson|Square One]] and familiarizing myself with Steve Patterson's work, I came to this conclusion:\n\n_There are just so many things I need to learn before I could reach a personally satisfying understanding of the world._\n\nThis, of course, isn't bad. In fact, it should excite any sincere seeker of truth. And excitement was what I felt after realizing the immensity of thinking that has accumulated for thousands of years about the fundamental questions of reality. However, the realization presented me with an obvious practical problem.\n\nBefore encountering Patterson's work, I already held beliefs about the world. These beliefs have been with me since what I may call \"my enlightenment\" in 2011. While I have not reached an amount of certainty on these beliefs that would push me to commit to them 100%, I have definitely invested my time and emotions \"acting\" according to them.\n\nFor example, for quite some time now, I have held the belief that ultimately there is no skin-encapsulated ego-centric \"self.\" Instead, what exists is an \"interdependent self\" made up of myself, other humans, animals, plants, and the physical world. This belief, which I now understand as a \"metaphysical\" claim about reality, has inspired me to act on a considerable amount of environmentalism in previous years. These actions can be considered derivatives of an \"ethics\" (moral principles) inspired by my metaphysical understanding of the world. Early in my philosophical journey, without diving deep on the literature, I felt intuitively that: **my metaphysics informs my ethics**.\n\nNow, after meeting [Patterson's](http://steve-patterson.com) work, it became clear to me that I have to get deeper on my metaphysical beliefs to check their accuracy. Or more accurately, to check whether or not I am upholding one of my most cherished values: **honesty**. It became even clearer that this should be an important part of my [[About me]] for years to come. I said \"years\" because again, there's just too much information to consume!\n\nThis led me to my major conundrum:\n\n_Because my metaphysical understanding of the universe ultimately informs my ethical intentions, should I wait for that understanding to be complete and accurate before I act in any personally meaningful, ethical way?_\n\nThis conundrum is based on the worry that if my understanding of the world is flawed, my actions, which are influenced by that understanding, may also be flawed.\n\n## \"Just Start and Iterate as You Go\"\n\nWhile pondering on the questions, I remembered the concept of the \"minimum viable product\" (or MVP) popularized by silicon valley entrepreneurs Steve Blank and Eric Ries. The MVP is a product that is intentionally released to the public in its simplest useable form. Releasing a product in this \"ugly\" version has two purposes: (1) to test the product's marketability and (2) to lessen costs and risks of monetary loss associated with the project.\n\nThe idea came out of the more innovative members of the business world—creatives who are bombarded every day with a lot of project ideas and worries on how to start them. The concept of an MVP gave these creatives a framework that encouraged them to **\"just start and iterate as you go.\"** This, my friends, is a good model applicable to any journey one takes in life.\n\nContemplating the concept of an MVP, I played on the idea of applying it in the philosophical journey I decided to start. I reasoned that there is no way that I could create a personally fulfilling picture of reality, at least at this early point in my journey. While my understanding of the world will take some time to develop, the issues that bother my emotions cannot wait—poverty, violence, the destruction of nature. I _have_ to act according to what I care about _right now_ if I am to contribute to any difference.\n\nI need to act now according to what I believe is right and make use of whatever amount of metaphysical knowledge I have to inform my actions. Then, like a startup entrepreneur, I will treat my worldview as a minimum viable product—a minimum viable worldview—open to iteration as I go along.\n\nI would define a minimum viable worldview as a worldview that makes use of whatever one knows about the world _right now_ to inform what one could do _right now_. It is a worldview that allows one to get out there and do some meaningful work while at the same time learning, absorbing input, and modifying one's worldview as feedback is received.\n\n## Humility and Resoluteness\n\nIn my opinion, the minimum viable worldview fosters two values, which I think is essential in any philosophical journey.\n\nFirst, the minimum viable worldview encourages **humility** by accepting one's state of uncertainty and ignorance at the beginning of the journey. It brings this even further as one opens oneself to the views of others and the strong possibility of being corrected multiple times.\n\nDespite this, however, the framework allows one to foster **resoluteness**—to stand firm on things that one is \"reasonably certain\" and convinced about at the \"present\" moment. The framework encourages active participation in the most pressing issues of our time despite one's seemingly limited understanding of the world. A person who is strongly called at the moment to contribute to the furthering of the cause need not understand the totality of knowledge. She could act now, and grow along the way.\n\nI am not sure if I get this one correctly. The framework itself is open to feedback and iteration. But in its current form, I find it meaningful and useful. The framework permits me to continue my environmental activism while I examine the very roots of my beliefs.\n",

    "content": "\nThe process I'm suggesting on how to answer the question \"[[thoughts/how to live?]]\" is a process that does not need to be tied to the discipline of [[thoughts/philosophy]].\n\nThe process involves the following steps:\n1. Answer: How do you know what you know?\n2. Answer: What exists and, therefore, what does not exist?\n3. Use the information from #1 and #2 to answer how you should act.\n\nFor example,\n1. I trust what I see.\n2. I see a flower.\n3. Because I see a flower and by observation I can pick it up, I pick it up.\n\nThis process happens all the time.\n\nHow we decide how we know what we know determines what we believe exists. And our knowledge about what exists informs what we can do.\n\nThe simple process only gets complicated when we start to entertain more questions extending each question.\n\nHow do you know what you know?\n- Does what you know come from a supernatual being?\n- Is what you know subjective or objective?\n\nWhat exists?\n- Does God exists?\n- Is there a soul?\n\nHow should you act?\n- How do we know what is right or wrong?\n- Is there morality in the first place?\n\nFrom these questions arise complex answers from where religion, worldviews, and belief systems emerge. These worldviews differ because they have different answers to the questions esp. #1 and #2.\n\nBut now matter how complex these worldviews are, they all boil down to the same process you did when you picked up a flower.\n- They defined how they know what they know.\n- The defined what exists.\n- They determined how to act based on their knowlege.\n\nThat is how they were able to answer that elusive question, How to live? This is how you will answer that question for yourself.\n\nBoth a Christian and an atheist may believe that we should act nonviolently. In this case, they have the same answer to #3 (how to act). But they have mutually exclusive reasons for doing so. The Christian is motivated by a belief in the Bible (#2). On the other hand, the atheist does not believe in the Bible, only science (#1) and, therefore, only believe in the existence of human beings that deserve to be treated justly.\n\nMetaphor\n\nYou are lost in a strange place and you don't know what to do.\n\nYou look for people to ask about where you are and what is out there.\n\nWhat you will know about the place will largely depend on the people you ask.\n\n## Related\n\n- [[A Simple Process for Answering the Question How to Live?]]\n",

    "content": "\nTantan has grown up to the point where he starts to annoy me sometimes. He has never called me names before. When he was so little, I was just Tito Vince for him. Now, out of nowhere, he would get to my face sometimes just to say, “Hi Shrek!”\n\nThat pesky boy. He was much more sweeter than this. It is as if it wasn’t that long ago when I first saw him, his head resting on my sister’s shoulder because it was too big, too heavy for his neck to carry. The memory of the time when he first called me by my name (“Tito Vince”) was still so vivid. I was just playing with him upstairs at my parents’ house, when all of a sudden he stopped. Then he started enumerating all of the people he knows inside that house: Mama, Papa, Lolo, Lola, Tito Vince. My younger sister, her Tita, wasn’t there at that time, so unfortunately she didn’t make the cut. But hearing him do that for the first time, hearing him recognize that he was part of a family, was probably one of the highlights of my life as a Tito. And so you can only imagine how bad I felt when this ridiculous young man started calling me Shrek.\n\nOn the first day of May, I was preparing to leave after more than a week of vacation at Baguio and Pangasinan. It was the first time my sister’s family went home to Pangasinan in two years since the pandemic started, and Tantan was reunited with his grandparents. He extended his vacation for another three days after his parents and two siblings went back home to Baguio, so he was there with me in the morning of my trip back to Laguna.\n\nSince I have a few hours left before my ride arrives, I decided to do another journaling session at the small kubo overlooking my uncle’s rice field. I frequent that kubo every morning whenever I am in Pangasinan, to journal for a few minutes. Turns out, Tantan’s phone has ran out of battery and he had to charge it. Aside from calling me names, Tantan has been on his phone for the most part of our time together, so it is starting to get really difficult to connect with him. But he can’t use his phone now, and he was obviously bored.\n\n“I am going out. To the field. Do you want to come?” I asked him. He looked at me, smiled, that nodded his head in agreement.\n\nI took my bag, put my journal and ballpen in, and carried a chair. I started walking out of the gate and Tantan followed me.\n\nWhat Tantan and I saw\n- A lone dog, fluffy brown, walking on the road/\n- Two boys flying a kite.\n- Two kid goats ran towards their mother and suck her milk vigorously.\n- We saw a black kid with a black goat mother.\n- Tan tan and I sat under the mango tree, where I also sat with Lea.\n- When we left, the kids went there and played.",

They believe that disembodied persons or powers are not in some otherworldly realm but rather on the top of a certain mountain, in the depths of the forest, or “everywhere”.

A theoretical discussion and exploration on walking\n\n## The Long Walk\n\n(Map)\n\nDate: June 9, 2022 (about a year ago)\nLocations: Los Baños—Bay—Calauan—San Pablo City\nStats:\n- Distance: 22 kms\n- Steps: 35,000 steps\n- Time: 5 hours\n\nAt the threshold between Calauan and San Pablo City (10-km hike; 630 ft. elevation), I asked: \"Why am I walking?\"\n\nThis led to weeks and months of journaling and reflection. -\u003e I was walking because I was trying to find who I was after leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\n## Who are JWs?\n\n- As of 2022, 8.6 million worldwide\n- 239 countries\n- As of 2022, 238,000 active members in the Philippines (For every 482 Filipinos there is 1 JW)\n- Most controversial beliefs\n\t- No blood transfusion -\u003e possible thousands of deaths\n\t- “Two-witness” rule for reporting abuse and misconduct -\u003e sexual abuse coverups\n\n## Taxonomies of Leaving the JWs\n\nFor me personally, nothing is more controversial than the JWs rules on people leaving the organization:\n\n1. Nanlamig - not made sin; just stopped attending meetings or preaching anymore \u003c- shepherding (lost sheep back)\n2. Tiwalag - sinned; shunned even by family (no talking; contact is limited only on necessary and practical matters); mention my sister\n3. Apostata - a current or former JW who has started criticizing the religion publicly\n\nMention the film: Apostasy by Daniel Kokotajlo\n\n## I Am an Ex-JW\n\n(Photo)\n\n- Raised as a JW\n- Began reading the Pangasinan Bible in front of the congregation at 8 years old\n- Became a regular pioneer (a member who was required to preach 70 hours per month) when I was 16 (first-year college)\n- Learned sign language, joined a sign language congregation, and became a ministerial servant at age 18 (third-year college, 2010).\n\n## Why I left\n\n- 2011: Suffered from clinical depression\n- Lost faith in God\n- Lost faith in the organization\n- 2012: Just woke up one day realizing I no longer believe\n\nMy parents and younger sister are still talking to me so I guess I am just categorized as “nanlamig.”\n\nBut writing this essay makes me a good candidate for being an apostate.\n\n## After Jehovah\n\n- 2012–2014: Atheism and Humanism \n- 2015–2017: Eastern Spirituality and Religion\n- 2017–present: Philosophy and Free Religion (but also agnostic? Uncertain? No longer care that much?)\n\n## What Happened to Me in the Long Walk?\n\nThe essay was a means to make sense of what happened to me on that threshold between Los Baños and San Pablo City when I asked why was I walking.\n\nTo analyze the connection between the long walk and my life as an ex-JW, I delved into the literature on:\n- Liminality\n- Walking\n- Autoethnography\n\n## Life in the Limen\n\nI discussed what liminality is.\n\nCharacteristics of being in a liminal state that I noticed in me:\n- being unaware I was in one\n- sense of being alone\n- shape-shifting identity\n- heightened openness to multiple ideas and meanings\n- filled with uncertainty\n- difficulty committing to almost anything\n- going back and forth between the structure of the Old Self and the anti-structure of the New Self Becoming\n\n## Walking to Traverse Liminality\n\nI built an argument on how walking was able to make me conscious about being in the limen and how it provided a way for me to traverse or live in it.\n\nWalking has been used as a method in ethnographic research.\nWalking is used in ethnography because:\n- The shared encounter and activity provides the first commonality between the researcher and participant.\n- Informal (participants become more open and reveal more)\n\nIf walking works with ethnography, maybe it can also work with autoethnography.\n\nWhat is autoethnography?\n- “Autoethnography is an approach to research and writing that seeks to describe and systematically analyze (graphy) personal experience (auto) in order to understand cultural experience (ethno)” (Ellis et al., 2011).\n- The execution of autoethnography is more straightforward when one's culture and social group is clear.\n\nCentral Problem: \"What if, like I am, you are in a psycho-socio-religious liminal state where your identity and social group are undefined and in flux?\"\n- Even someone in the limen has multiple identities: Old Self and New Self Becoming.\n- Perhaps, these two is enough and they can encounter each other and even talk.\n\n(Photo illustration)\n\n- I then propose that walking, at least in my case, is the lube that makes encounter between the Old Self and New Self Becoming easier.\n- I argue that through walking, the following insights can be generated:\n\t- The distance between two identities (how different they really are)\n\t- The means to traverse that distance (can they be reconciled or integrated?)\n\t- The path towards arrival and reintegration or finding home in the limen\n\nMy theoretical analysis of what happened\n- I was in a liminal state after leaving the JWs but was almost unaware of it.\n- I had an unquenchable desire to walk.\n- The embodied, emplaced, and irreverent act of walking prompted me to ask \"Why was I walking in the first place?\"\n- A long period of reflection and journaling made me realize I was in limen and that walking was a symptom of that.\n- Through the irreverent, embodied, and emplaced act of walking I was able to make my New Self Becoming talk with my Old Self and consider the path forward.\n\n## The Larger Context\n\nThis essay is part of a larger but very personal project:\n- Creating a New Self Becoming\n\n(Show illustration)\n\nAs a JW, we were discouraged to read secular books, especially if we are holding a leadership position. So, it was impossible to become a true writer while inside there.\n\nOnly after leaving the JWs and letting go of my \"young pastor identity\" did I gain a real shot of becoming a writer. I read and write a lot, voraciously, after I left.\n\nAs I continue walking in the limen, I notice that the writer + artist identity is slowly replacing the religious young pastor identity I once had.\n\n- Through writing, walking, and art I am still able to be contemplative, engage with the big questions, but in a secular nature.\n- Engaging in these new activities have been seminal in creating my New Self Becoming.\n\nWriting and art (in addition to walking) are ways for me right now to traverse the limen.\n\n**Projects to Traverse the Limen**\n- Experiment on walking as a platform for creative work (writing and photography)\n- Experiment on walking as a tool to encounter Self, Others, and Place\n- “Deep walking” on a specific place:\n\t- Current: Los Baños (use walking to explore the meaning of being home away from home)\n\t- Next: Baguio (re-walk preaching routes and see what emerges from it)\n\t- Next: Pangasinan (San Jacinto or entire province? Use walking to reconnect with cultural identity and perhaps contribute with the urgent project of saving the Pangasinan language)\n- “Wide walking”: Long walks crossing multiple municipalities (like I did from LB to San Pablo), taking photos, writing along the way, and creating something out of these (definitely hybrid: photo books with essays, vignettes, philosophical insights, and poems)\n\n## Issues I Need Your Help With\n\n**On the piece's identity**\n\n- Is this really an autoethnography? If not, what does it need to be one?\n- Does it even need to be an autoethnography? Is autoethnography the best way to present and capture my subject matter?\n- Was there really an \"ethno\" in my work?\n- Do I even need to call the piece \"an autoethnography\"? How does one give a work a title, especially when it is hybrid?\n\n**On form**\n- How do I make the elements of the essay talk better (i.e., photos, theory, autobiography, walking narrative)?\n- How can I play with form so I can make my reader feel like the piece is \"walk\" or was written through walking or mimics walking?\n\n**On craft**\n- Was I divulging too much? Was I divulging too little?\n- What do you think about my argument on using walking in autoethnography?\n- What is the piece lacking?\n- How was the scholarly and the poetic balanced throughout the work? Does it need to be more critical? Does it need to be more creative?\n- How was the intro?\n- How was the conclusion?\n- Based on the piece, may I ask for feedback on my skills as a writer: What am I doing right? Where can I improve?\n\n**On the larger context**\n\n- Are my project ideas okay?\n- Who are the writers or works I need to read?\n- Who are Filipino writers who have integrated walking into their process and works? How are they doing it?\n\n---\n\n## Overview (8 mins.)\n\nIn the piece, I was weaving:\n- A narrative of a long walk I did\n- Some autobiographical accounts about my past as a JW\n- Discussion on the academic literature on walking\n\n### The walk\n\nWhen: June 9, 2022 (about a year ago)\nWhere: Los Baños—Bay—Calauan—San Pablo City\nHow: 22 kms; 35,000 steps; 5 hours; 10-km hike (630 ft. elevation)\n\n- Show the Google Map\n- Show Strava data\n\nThere was a brief moment almost exactly at the middle of the walk when I was tired and feeling the pain of it all and realized I didn't actually have any strong reason for doing the walk. I just wanted to do it.\n\nThis launched me into months of introspection and asking. Specifically provoked \n\n### The autobiography\n\nMy past as a Jehovah's Witnesses\n- Present some facts about JWs\n\t- Current population\n\t- Current locations in the world\n\t- Population in the Philippines\n\t- Key beliefs\n- My story:\n\t- Raised since a child in the church\n\t- Began reading the Bible in front of the congregation at 8 years old (Grade 3?). We were in a Pangasinan-speaking congregation so the Bible was in Pangasinan\n\t- Began giving 5 minute talks about short bible verses at 12 years old (First-year High school?)\n\t- Became a regular pioneer (required to preach house-to-house or informally for 70 hours per month) when I was 16 (First-year college)\n\t- Learned sign language, joined a sign language congregation, then became a ministerial servant at age 18 (Third-year college, 2010). I was probably the youngest MS in the entire Baguio at that time. I did 30-minute public talks, got invited to talk in other congregations\n\t- March 2011 suffered from depression and started questioning God. My faith was already crumbling down. I intentionally committed a sin as a response to my suffering. The sin was uncovered by elders. I was tried. I was given a probationary period, discipline, was not allowed to give talks for about a month, but I kept my RP and ministerial servant position. After the month-long probationary period, we were visited by a CO, a leader of the congregation who manages a number of congregations. He overturned the decision and removed me as a pastor. The CO shouldn't know my case because it should have been kept a secret. But someone leaked it and that was when my trust and faith on the organization was lost.\n\t- I left in 2012. It is now 2023 and I have not returned nor shown signs of returning.\n\t- I have different religious identity phases:\n\t\t- Humanist, atheistic state\n\t\t- Eastern philosophy state\n\t\t- Agnostic, philosophical, free religion state\n\t- One of the most important observations after leaving the JWs was that my skepticism to almost all beliefs became really high. I went around spiritual circles but never really committed and was notoriously inquisitive to religious authorities. It was difficult for me to commit.\n\t- This and other behaviors I exhibited since leaving the JWs was explained to me after encountering the concept of liminality.\n\n### Theory\n\n#### Liminality\n\nI presented where the concept of liminality come from and how it evolved.\n\n\u003eEthnography: Genep, Les Rites de Passage (1909) -\u003e Architecture: Aldo van Eyck (1950s) -\u003e Anthropology: Victor Turner (1960s)\n\nI provided some descriptions of being in a liminal state:\n\u003e- death, being in utero, and the wilderness \n\u003e- “a realm that has few or none of the attributes of the past or coming state” (Turner “Betwixt and Between” 47)\n\u003e- one’s existential “thrownness” (Dahistrom 12) becomes even more pronounced.\n\u003e- identity shape shifts, and nothing is final (Turner “Liminality and Communitas” 94–95).\n\u003e- more open to multiple ideas and meanings as they attempt to recreate themselves (Stenner 209).\n\u003e- filled with uncertainty (Stenner 239) and, in my experience, difficulty committing to almost anything.\n\u003e- go back and forth between the structure of my Old Self and the anti-structure of my New Self Becoming (Stenner 266).\n\nI used autobiographical anecdotes that match these descriptions.\n\nThe point I was trying to make was that I didn't know I was in a liminal state and walking, especially after the long walk, helped me realize my liminal state.\n\n\n\n#### Walking\n\nI described walking as a symptom of liminality, performed liminality.\n\nI gave an example of a writer who explicitly associates his writing with his liminal status as an adopted child.\n\nIn the essay I explained what walking does and proposed an explanation of how it helped me:\n1. Realized my liminal state\n2. Provided a way for me to traverse that liminality\n\nAs I am preparing this presentation, I realize that I am crossing a new threshold. By speaking up against the faith, I am becoming an apostate. If published, my parents may never speak to me again. And I am not ever sure I am ready to cross that line.\n\n## Context\n\nI want to continue to explore walking as a platform for creative work.\n\nIn particular, I want to intentionally use walking to befriend place, others, and self.\n\nRight now, in my website, I am trying to experiment with writing essays that combine narrative, poetry, philosophy, and photography.\n- Lilim\n\t- One insight essays\n\t- Walk narratives\n\t- Collage essays\n\n- The Long Walk\n\t- Open diary\n\nThis is what I am sure of:\n1. I want to find a way to combine different disciplines and media into my work.\n2. I want to combine different perspectives: cosmic, social, and self.\n\nA book series project idea: To continue to explore my identity as an XJW? (I'm not even sure what to call myself) by using walking in specific geographic locations.\n- Los Baños - possibility of home; being far from JWs; home in limen or reintegration? (maybe write this in Filipino?)\n- Baguio - confronting the memories of being in the religion, visiting places, re-walking paths taken (maybe write this in English)\n- San Jacinto, Pangasinan - confronting childhood (maybe write this in Pangasinan?)",

    "content": "\nHi. My name is Vince Imbat. I'm a writer, poet, and photographer who walks in Laguna and elsewhere in the Philippines. I spend most of my days thinking and contemplating about the question _\"How should I live?\"_\n\n## Subscribe to my newsletters\n\nI regularly send two newsletters:\n\n- _[Lilim](/tags/lilim)_: a bi-weekly newsletter about walking in Laguna and elsewhere in the Philippines.\n- _[Uman](/tags/uman)_: a monthly newsletter documenting what it means to pursue philosophy, contemplation, and writing independently as a way of life.\n\n## What I Do\n\nIn my pursuit for answers, I study a wide variety of resources from different disciplines, cultures, and eras. I collect insights about the art of living and carefully and critically reflect on them. I write my thoughts in [atomic notes](https://notes.vinceimbat.com) and revisit them regularly through a note-writing system and practice I call [Talahardin](ttps://notes.vinceimbat.com) or \"garden of notes.\" I support this practice by cultivating mindfulness, moderation, and introspection, facilitated in no small part by [long walks](/tags/walk-narratives). I see walking as a discipline of its own or perhaps a state of mind that creates a space for me to pause and grow my thoughts organically.\n\nTaken together, all of these create a holistic \"practice of the mind,\" which I hope would help me better understand the world. Occasionally, when I have made enough progress on a certain subject, I write an essay about it. These essays are usually [personal](/categories/personal-essays) in nature, a narrative of how I have understood and embodied the things I have learned through contemplation and application. Some of them are more [theoretical](/categories/essays) as I attempt to understand things in a more objective and general lens.\n\nMy goal for studying and writing is always to develop deep understanding first, so that I could respond to life appropriately. My studies are designed to help me act with purpose, integrity, and compassion. I experiment with different methods on how to achieve this and report my progress in my monthly newsletter, _[Uman](/tags/uman)_. I also write a bi-weekly newsletter on walking called _[Lilim](/tags/lilim)_.\n\n## What Led Us Here\n\nI was once a young pastor for an evangelical religion in a group specifically ministering to the Deaf. My life had its challenges, but a clear path was laid in front of me and I just had to follow it. Everything I believed in was spoon-fed to me and everything I did conformed with a prewritten script. I was an inexperienced 19-year-old with many years ahead of me, but I felt safe, secure, and purpose-driven.\n\nIn 2011, all of that changed as I went through a painful year-long depressive episode that changed my life forever. The suffering I experienced led me to question everything I used to believe about myself and the world I lived in. It crushed my entire worldview to pieces, and along with it, my identity and life purpose.\n\nA year after my depressive episode, I left my calling at the church to seek a new way of life—one that was more authentic to who I really am. I was faced with the almost impossible challenge of rebuilding how I saw the world and my place in it. Having abandoned my previous beliefs, community, and way of life, I was left without a clear path and purpose. I had no choice but to find my own.\n\nLittle did I knew that the years of programming within the confines of my childhood religion was designed to crush this very desire to search for truth independently. With no knowledge or training to do a proper search, I jumped from one political, philosophical, or spiritual tradition to the next, only to find myself with the same existential void I had when I started. No matter how enticing the existing groups and traditions were, they always left out or even went against an important aspect of my personhood. Political and philosophical groups I joined glorified intellectualization, critical thinking, and abstract reasoning while dismissing contemplative practices and self-understanding. On the other hand, existing spiritual groups, both Western and Eastern, heavily used illogical languages as they neglected and even discouraged the cultivation of a rich intellectual life.\n\nDespite these challenges, I continued to have an insatiable hunger for truth, freedom, and beauty. I knew deep within me that these three could all coexist in a single way of life—a way of life where one can have a deep and satisfying relationship with oneself and the world while still being able to cultivate a sharp mind that does not have to believe in things it is not ready to believe in.\n\nBut to live such a way of life, I realized that my path shall never be found _out there_. It had to be built—handcrafted _in here_ by my own mind from the ground up through an independent philosophical and contemplative practice.\n\n## Where We Are Going\n\nMy purpose is to live a life filled with _Ginhawa_ —a Filipino concept, which is usually translated as \"well-being,\" and _Saysay_, which means \"meaning\". I want to help build a world filled with meaning and well-being—a world where self-actualizing people live in nonviolence, compassion, and freedom. To realize this vision, I am committed to developing \"deep understanding\"—that is, to \"see things and people as they truly are,\" so I may always act with mindfulness and compassion.\n\nMy most important work right now is to develop my understanding of myself and the world around me and to live intentionally. Along the way, I use this website as an iterative documentation of this journey, an ever-updating resource for living a life of purpose and meaning. To document my journey, I write reports that combine a narrative and a how-to manual of my individual projects and life areas. Ultimately, the essays published in this website along with the [Talahardin](https://notes.vinceimbat.com) shall serve as an articulation of my personal life philosophy.\n\n## Other Projects\n\nI also maintain other projects adjacent to my main work:\n\n- [Kaliskis na Ulap](https://kaliskisnaulap.com/) - A collection of translations from Henry David Thoreau's journal and other writings.\n\n- [Mantaltaliwa](https://mantaltaliwa.substack.com/) - A collection of contemplative literary works written in Pangasinan.\n\n## How to Stay in Touch\n\nI created this website to share my work and in the process find fellow companions in this journey. If you are interested in learning more about what it means to live a life of independent thought, contemplation, walking, and writing, you might find my work helpful. I write about my journey and document projects related to this way of life in my monthly email newsletter _Uman_. You can learn more about the newsletter and subscribe [here](newsletter.md).\n\nAlternatively, you can directly send me an email at [vince@vinceimbat.com](mailto:vince@vinceimbat.com). I would love to start a conversation with you.\n\nOf course, you can always start by exploring my work first. Read some of my [poetry](/categories/poetry), [vignettes](/categories/vignettes), or [personal essays](/categories/personal-essays). Or you could jump right into my more theoretical works by checking out my [essays](/categories/essays) or browsing through my collection of [notes](https://notes.vinceimbat.com).\n\nWhatever you choose to do, it is my sincere hope that our paths meet again.\n",

    "title": "Accessing Ginhawa Directly",
    "content": "\n![Masamirey Cove](Masamirey-Cove.jpg)\n\nI sat at the farthest seat at the back of the Anfra. The one near the lock of the backdoor. I like this position. It allows me to stretch my legs on the long bench-like seats of the Anfra while I look out the window. My sister sat on the other side, parallel to me, doing the same thing: stretching out her legs and looking out the window. I opened my window as wide as it can and felt the cold breeze blow strong on my face as the vehicle started moving. I felt good.\n\nBy the time we reached the beach, the sun is about to set. Probably, about twenty minutes before it's gone. I walked towards the little waves and let them tickle the tiny spaces between my toes as the sand beneath my feet slowly gushed back to the ocean. The breeze is colder and stronger here than on the road, but it didn't feel as consoling. What feels really consoling is the water. Not the tickle of the waves but just the presence of water. Perhaps, even the sound of it.\n\nI felt good.\n\nAfter a long time, I felt _really_ good.\n\nThere was a time in my life when I didn't feel anything—not sadness or happiness, nothing.\n\nThis is what depression and the drugs that attempt to cure it do—they numb that part of you that feels. Depression is not sadness. It is the absence of sadness—and all other emotions.\n\nAs my brain slowly healed, I started noticing how little things and actions generate feel-good experiences. These are things and actions I used to overlook—things like the cold breeze or the presence of flowing water. Today, exposing myself to these things and taking tiny actions that immediately make me feel good form a large part of what I do every day.\n\nI realized that everything we want—our goals and aspirations—are desired not for themselves but for the _feelings_ that they generate. We work not for money and not even for what money could buy but for the _feelings_ and _experiences_ that are generated by what money could buy. We don't realize this often but what we really desire in life is to feel good.\n\nWorse, what we don't often realize is that it doesn't take a lot of work, time, or money to actually feel good. Of course, taking care of our finances, finding work we love, or taking time to nurture good relationships all create external situations where good feelings are easier to generate. However, it doesn't mean that we need to wait long or work hard just to feel what we want to feel.\n\nThere are simple, tiny actions we can do to feel good _now_—tiny actions like spending time in nature where air and water could console us. These are actions that help us access our emotions _directly_ thus generating our desired states of mind _immediately_. If feeling good is the ultimate goal, then perhaps these shortcuts to feeling good should always be our priority.\n\nThis is ultimately the reason why I will always be a fan of self-care practices like meditation, yoga, journaling, proper nutrition, sleep, being in nature, and exercise. All of these generate good feelings almost immediately after they're performed. There is no need to wait years to experience happiness or _Ginhawa_ (the indigenous Filipino concept that captures integral well-being). These feelings are just one breath, one asana, one journal page, one nutritious meal, one good night sleep, one walk at the beach, or one workout away.\n\nWhat's more, establishing a strong foundation of tiny feel-good practices prepares us to tackle the larger, more complex projects that we need to take on. And if a big tragedy occurs—which always does—we're better prepared for them.\n\nPractices that let us access Ginhawa directly makes us more capable and resilient individuals.\n",

    "title": "Action is the most important concept in understanding how to live",
    "content": "\nWhat an action is\n\nI am partial with the idea that the best conceptual tools are the smallest units.\n\nAn action is not a basic unit because it still have parts. The relationship created by those parts is what we then interpret as an action.\n\nTo understand what an action is, we need to understand its parts.\n\n**The metaphysics of action**\n\nFirst of all, the word action corresponds to something we observe happens in the universe. It is something we can observe happening in other people but it is also something we can observe within ourselves. Most words we use in language act this way: they refer to a concept we form inside our head about something that happens in the universe. In short, an action is a conceptual tool to understand reality.\n\nNow, any conceptual tool will also be based on what one believes to be the basic units of reality. Philosophers call the area of learning about these basic units “metaphysics”.\n\nI personally am biased towards the metaphysical theory called metaphysical pluralism. It’s a perspective that says there are many basic units of reality, as opposed to just one (idealism) or two (dualism).\n\nAnatomy of an action\n\n**Intentions**\n\nIn order for it to count as an action, there has to be an intention.\n\nIntention is the desire made conscious and declared personally or publicly.\n\nIntentions are statements about future states that one desires to be in.\n\nOne may create intentions about ACTIONS and ENDS.\n\nBoth serve their purposes.\n\nIntentions about ENDS remind us what we really are going after, thus the standard for evaluating the effectiveness of our actions.\n\nIntentions about ACTIONS, on the other hand, inform us of the system, the process, the daily practices, the habits that we need to manifest if we are to realize our ENDS.\n\n**Means**\n\nThere are many means towards your desired feeling.\n\nThe Feedback Loop\n\n**The Length of the Feedback Loop**\n\nThe way I understand it, an intention is a good starting point for calculating the length of the action feedback loop.\n\nThere are actions where the loop is short because the time length from intention to the resulting state is shorter. On the other hand, there are actions that take long periods of time between intention to end.\n\nTo understand the difference between these two lengths, let’s try an example.\n\nLet’s say that I set the intention to feel happy. I know how it feels to be happy because I felt it before. I have a desired state I want to be in again and now I’m setting an intention to get back to it.\n\nWhile there is a single desired feeling (feeling happy), there are many means towards it. Some require a shorter time to commence, while others take longer.\n\nFor example, a short means I can use to feel happy is to buy myself chocolate. Almost immediately after eating the chocolate, the sugar reacts to my brain and brings me towards the result: feeling happy.\n\nOn the other hand, a means that will take a longer time period to bring me towards my desired state is finding myself a dog. The means require me to perform different actions, all of them containing their own feedback loops. For example, I need to decide what kind of dog I want to buy then I’ll have to look for a pet shop that sells the kind of dog I’m looking for then I’ll have to visit the shop and take a look at the dog, etc.\n\nAn action that contains a set of actions should have a different name. They’re called projects.\n\nWhile projects are great because they tend to establish foundations where desired states are repeatedly experienced (i.e., I buy a dog once, I feel happy everyday I’m with the dog after), we can get all caught up with them that we forget about the smaller actions we can take every day that could actually bring us to our desired feeling states faster.\n\nMeditating.\n\nSleeping.\n\nEating good food.\n\nCatching the sunset.\n\nPlaying with kids.\n\nJournaling.\n\nThese are actions that require a smaller time frame to get us to feeling happy.\n\nAn ideal life is a life that contains days when you are working on a larger project that will make it possible for you to experience your desired feelings long-term, while at the same time, performing simple actions that connect you with your desired feelings today.\n\nAside from giving you instant gratification, the simple actions act as an insurance: if your larger project turns out to be a flop and you don’t experience the feelings you desire from it, you still have simpler actions and habits put in place to keep you grounded.\n\nWhy is it important\n\nRepeated actions become habits.\n\nSmall, seemingly irrelevant habits, are the scaffolding for bigger projects like creative projects.\n\n",

Palagay ko’y hindi naman kailangang ipaliwanag ng sumulat ang kanyang akda.\n\nAt nag-comment ako sa mga akda ng iba kung gusto ko ang mga yon — ano ang nagustuhan ko at bakit ko nagustuhan. At  nagtanong lang ako kung may hindi ako maintindihan, o kung may maimumungkahi ako para mas mapaganda ang akda.\n\nGawin mo lang ang ginagawa mo sa Tungko.

Pangalawa, naiintindihan ko siguro yung anxiety mo dahil ako rin dati \"coming in from the cold\" o galing sa DIY writing, etc. Normal yun. Pangatlo, the fact na natanggap ka, big deal yun. Nakita nila yung kakayanan mo (kung malamang nagsubmit ka ng sample essay or work). Lastly, agree ako sa approach at tanong mo -- anong tamang mindset. Maturity yun. Palagay ko lang din, baka ibang generation na rin ngayon kaysa noon na medyo malupit o parang crucible ang ibang workshop. Marami namang chill lang din, very nurturing. Palagay ko ganun yung sa Ateneo. So welcome it with gratitude and joy. Constructive criticism can be good for growth. Sabi nga ni Nietzsche: what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. hehe. Learning \u0026 growth mindset kap, part of the journey to bring out your best. Ganda rin maka-connect sa ibang writers. Masaya yan. Paalis lang ako ngayon. Pero open itong usapan na ito sa atin anytime.\n\nWalang anuman Kap. Sige kung pwede, pabasa ng essay mo. Maganda yung personal essay on leaving your childhood religion. Choice talaga kung ang subject ay mas hindi autobiographical, pero hindi ito disadvantage sa tingin ko. Palagay ko magtiwala na lang din muna sa mutual respect at maturity ng mga kasama mong babasa. Experience. Pero wala sigurong dapat ikatakot o ikahiya.\n\nSa kung anong titingnan sa pagbasa ng gawa ng iba siguro simula sa gut feel at understanding sa gusto nilang sabihin. Pwedeng  tingnan yung clarity, style, elegance, evocativeness at voice ng sinulat at pagkakasulat. Sa alam ko lang din. Hehe. Andun yun sa On Writing Well na book. So ang intention ay sabay na matuto at siguro bigyan ng feedback ang isa't isa na helpful o constructive.\n\nMaganda rin maexpose sa ibang perspectives at styles ng pagsusulat ng mga kasama sa workshop. They will probably do the same with yours. So tama na maging handa pero bahagi nun ang pagiging bukas.\n\nPahabol - sa isang online writing class, ang apat na haligi ng prose ay: clarity, simplicity, elegance, and evocativeness. Binabalanse ang apat na ito, which means minsan dapat lean at walang sobra sa mga sentences (omit needless words - Strunk \u0026 White). Pero minsan dapat hayaan ding dumaloy ang salita dahil sa elegance at evocativeness, rhythm at voice. Pinaka-essential ano ang gustong sabihin. Pero ang art \u0026 craft ay sa kung paano sinabi para maintindihan, maranasan, at maramdaman ng bumabasa. Sa alam ko lang din, practice ito kasi balanse ng natural voice at learned craft at technique. Hope that makes sense. hehe. Baka mas maayos at malawak ang paliwanag sa mga librong na-share ko.\n\nLastly, I think you are already an avid reader. An editor-mentor of mine once guided me to read well-written articles \u0026 essays ALOUD. This is to get the feel and sound of words, the rhythm, phrasing, etc. Sana makatulong at hindi overload. hehe. Just choose what you can use Kap.\n\nWelcome Vince. Happy to help and vicariously inspired by your passion to learn and write. I think common sa ating lahat na mag-isip o mamili sa simple o mas complex na style ng pagsusulat. Parehong valid at pwedeng powerful depende sa gumagamit. Sa iba ang exercise nila ay imitation muna, ibig sabihin try mo sumulat ng simple tapos try din sumulat ng mas complex. Hanggang mahanap ang sariling way/voice at style. But this is just one way. Pwede ring diretso lang. Salamat sa pag-share ng essay mo. Babasahin ko ito. Looks very interesting at talagang lived/walked. Yung online class ay sa Udemy. \"Writing with Flair: How to Become An Exceptional Writer\" ni Shani Raja, former Wall Street Journal editor. Minsan meron silang discounted rates kaya naka-tiyempo ako. Sa Coursera meron ding free courses on writing. Pero suggest ko mag-focus muna siguro sa isa o dalawang learning tools/modes e.g. On Writing Well. But up to you. Dami nang channels of learning ngayon. Enjoy the journey!\n\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/writing-with-flair-how-to-become-an-exceptional-writer/learn/lecture/28038088?start=0#overview",

Be short and selective, particularly with quotes. Keep literature notes with their bibliographic details in your [[Reference system]].\n3. **Write permanent notes.** Once a day, review your [[Fleeting notes]] and [[literature notes]]. Think about how these relate to your own thinking. Use the following questions:\n   - Does the new information contradict, correct, support, or add to what you have in your Zettelkasten?\n   - Can you combine ideas to generate something new?\n   - What new questions arise?\n\n   Write these notes for your future self:\n\n   - Write one idea per note.\n   - Use full sentences.\n   - Indicate your references.\n   - Be brief and clear.\n\n   After processing the fleeting notes, throw them away. After processing literature notes, return them to your reference system.\n\n1. **Add links.** In each new permanent note, add links to related notes, to the index, or to an entry point linked to the index.\n\nTo write using the zettelkasten, see [[Write using permanent notes]].\n\n# References\n\nAhrens, S.

Amoralism is not an ethical theory. It is a meta-ethical theory, which means it is a theory about the status of ethics. Amoralism denies morality because there is no logical connection between metaphysics and ethics.\n\nInstead of using moral language, amoralists propose some [[Practical alternatives to morality]]. Some amoralists believe that it is okay to use moral language to help us achieve our ends.

I don't think I want to be around poeple exhibiting these behaviors and if there is a way for me to prevent them from abusing more, and I am in that capacity, then I should act. I am acting purely out of emotions and practical reasons.\n\nMy difference from a moralist could simply be that I do not use talk about \"inherent rights\" or morality to achieve my goals. But I could imagine a situation where I feel very strongly about protecting victims or would-be victims from an abuser. Amoralism does not automatically make me good or bad. It doesn't even want to use those words. Amoralism does not automatically make me an advocate for safety and lessening of suffering.

  "/An-Orchard-of-Ideas": {
    "title": "An Orchard of Ideas",
    "content": "In Henry David Thoreau's 26 September 1859 letter to one of his most avid readers, Harrison Gray Otis Blake, he wrote the following:\n\n\u003e In short, you’ve got to carry on two farms at once,—the farm on the earth and the farm in your mind.\n\n\"The farm on the earth\" was Thoreau's poetic representation of one's livelihood, one's source of income, while \"the farm in your mind\" is as it sounds_—_a figurative representation of that place where one's ideas are planted, cultivated, and grown.\n\nComparing the two farms, Thoreau said,\n\n\u003e It is easy enough to maintain a family, or a state, but it is hard to maintain these children of your brain (or say, rather, these guests that trust to enjoy your hospitality), they make such great demands; and yet, he who does only the former, and loses the power to think originally, or as only he ever can, fails miserably. Keep up the fires of thought, and all will go well.\n\nAside from comparing his work with farming or gardening, Thoreau has also compared his explorations of the natural world to harvesting. After hearing the sound of flail for several mornings in August 1854, he wrote in his journal:\n\n\u003e It leads me to ask if I have spent as industrious a spring and summer as the farmer, and gathered as rich a crop of experience. If so, the sound of my flail will be heard by those who have ears to hear, separating the kernel from the chaff all the fall and winter, and a sound no less cheering it will be. If the drought has destroyed the corn, let not all harvests fail. Have you commenced to thresh your grain? The lecturer must commence his threshing as early as August, that his fine flour may be ready for his winter customers.\n\nThis morning, as I woke up on a chilly morning, as I have been for about a week or so already, gray clouds covering the Cordillera, I felt deep gratitude for my work_—_sitting down, morning after morning, reading a few pages, then writing, drawing, or translating on my journals. I realized that whatever I have now is the most ideal life I could ever have. The work that I do is what I want to do, and it is also the life I want to live.\n\nLike Thoreau, I am a gatherer of perpetual seeds of thoughts from other artists_—_songs, poems, essays, books, drawings, photographs, letters, quotes, movies, scientific findings, philosophical arguments. And then I bring these seeds home to my journals (both digital and analog), where I nurture and cultivate them through revisiting them. By doing so, I become a farmer, a gardener, of the children of my mind, which, in turn, grow into my own ideas_—_or, more accurately, my own rendering of already existing ideas. Sometimes (or most of the time), I can't even take ownership of them for while I plant and cultivate them, it is the Muse, that mysterious part of the brain I prefer to call the Subconscious, which seem to make them grow.\n\nThis is what I would like to call, the \"Orchard of Ideas\". Every artist has one. You put all these orchards together and you basically get the \"Wilderness of Ideas\", where people could borrow or even steal wild seeds that they can replant and reuse in their own orchards.\n\nHere's a drawing I made this morning to illustrate these ideas:\n\n![Orchard of ideas](orchard-of-ideas.jpg)\n",

    "title": "An analysis of The Story of an Hour by Kate Chopin (1894)",
    "content": "## Layer 1: What?\n\nWho are the characters?\n- Mrs. Louise Mallard.\n\t- Louise is the protagonist. She occupies a lot of space and the author uses focalization to center the narrative around her. The POV is omniscient but it tends to focus on one character. This is Louise's story. The other characters contribute to her development. She is the only character who changes, which is typical in short stories.\n\t- Louise has heart trouble.\n\t- Rather than deny, she accepts her husband's death.\n\t- She has an inner life.\n- Mr. Brently Mallard, killed in a railroad disaster\n\t- \n- Josephine, Mrs. Mallard's sister who revealed Mr. Mallards death\n\t- Cares genuinely with her sister.\n\t- Close, talkes in sister code.\n- Richards, Mr. Mallard's friend who first heard of his friends's death\n\t- Has ulterior motives.\n\t- May be a controlling friend, may want to win Louise affection.\n\t- Should have gone home after breaking the news, but stays and covers Brently from Louise.\n\nWhat happens?\n- Mr. Mallard is killed in a railroad accident.\n- Josephine and Richard reveals the news to Mrs. Mallard.\n- Mrs. Mallard weeps.\n- Mrs. Mallard retreats to her room alone.\n- Mrs. Mallard sits on an armchair.\n- The author describes Mrs. Mallard's surroundings sensually.\n- Something approaches her from the sky.\n- The things tries to posess her.\n- She feels free.\n- She sees the years to come by herself.\n- She feels freed from marriage, which seems to have been cruel to her.\n- She doesn't really love her (And yet she had loved him—sometimes. Often she had not.)\n- Josephine tries to go in, feeling that Louise is hurting herself.\n- Louise continues to think about her future. He prays to have a long life.\n- Louise opens the door with a look of victory, and goes down with her sister.\n- Brently Mallard enters the home alive.\n- Josephine cried.\n- Louise dies of heart attack.\n- Richards covers Brently from the view of his wife.\n\nWhen does the story take place?\n- After Mr. Mallard is killed.\n\nWhere does the story take place?\n- At Mrs. Mallard's house.\n\nWhat is the story structure?\n- Act One is nonexistent. No status quo.\n- Act Two. Louise's reaction leads to this act. We learn of the Mallard's marriage through memories.\n- The punch line came abruptly with no description. We just infer that she died through one line.\n\n## Layer 2: Why?\n\nWhy does the author tell this story? What is the deeper meaning? Is the author trying to convince us of something? If so, what is it?\n\n- Comments on the role of women in society.\n- Expresses disapproval of women's marginalization.\n- Doctors and relatives thought Louise died of joy from seeing her husband but because the author gave us access to her thoughts, we know that this was caused by grief of seeing her husband.\n\n## Layer 3: How?\n\nKate Chopin places her character alone in a room for the bulk of the story, and it works. How did she do it?\n- Major things happened but they are only implied by the story through exposition.\n\t- We don't see the train accident or aftermath.\n\t- Richards confiming Brently's death is hidden.\n\t- Josephine's dialogue revealing Brently's death is also hidden.\n\t- Louise's death happened offstage.\n- Chopin does this to highlight Louise's transformation. She doesn't have to detail the other parts of the stories. Highlight only Louise's transformation. This reminds me of creating hierarchy in design which also applies in photography. In short works like this, this is also applied.\n- The ending is intentionally absurd so that we are left wondering what the cause of death is.\n\nDoes the story elicit some sort of response from you? What is that response, and more important, how does the author make you feel that way? What specific words or phrases spark those particular emotions?\n\nNotes\n\n- The author reveals the first names of the characters a while alter after she introduces them. This happened to Brently Mallard first then Louise Mallard\n\n# References\n\nPereira, G. (2016). _DIY MFA: Write with Focus, Read with Purpose, Build Your Community_. Writer’s Digest Books.",

    "content": "\nHindi ko pa pala nakukuhanan ng larawan ang nag-iisang mosque dito sa Los Baños—ang IMSA Jammi Al-khair sa Bulusan Street. Kaya, tumigil ako sandali upang kuhanan ito. Isang taon mahigit na ako rito at halos araw-araw akong napaparaan pero bakit ngayong ko lang naalalang kuhanan siya? At bakit ko siya kinuhanan ng larawan malayo sa mismong gate ng mosque? Bakit ako nakararamdam ng takot tulad ng nararamdaman ng mga aso sa paligid na mosque tuwing umaawit ang imam sa mikropono na naka-loud speaker na dinig mula likod ng mosque hanggang sa bukana ng campus. Umaalolong ang mga aso tuwing kumakanta ang imam—nangangamba, tula natatakot sa kakaibang tunog. Kakaiba, hindi --. Bakit tayo takot rito?\n\nIlang taon na ang nakakaraan, pumasok ako sa pink mosque sa Malaysia. Hindi ko alam kung bakit, pero nilapitan ako ng imam o basta lalakeng may katungkulan sa mosque. Inalok niya ako ng tour sa mga pribadong silid ng mosque. Takot ang una kong naramdaman kaya nagdahilan nalang akong marami pa akong dadalawin.\n\nDala ko pa rin ang takot na 'yon hanggang ngayon. At hindi lang ako. Lahat tayo takot sa bago, sa kakaiba, sa hindi pamilyar. Siguro, ito ang ginagawa sa'kin ng paglalakad, ang harapin ang mga bagay na kinatatakutan ko, ang bumati sa mga nakasasalubong ko sa daan, ang tumuloy maglakad kahit hindi ako sigurado saan hahantong ang lakad. Mahalaga ito dahil ang mundong gusto ko ay mundo ng mga taong matatapang, at higit sa lahat, hindi natatakot—payapa. Hindi na nga kailangan ng katapangan dahil ang pagbai sa mga kasalubong at pagtuklas ay natural na lamang. Ang pakikipagniig doon sa mg kaiba sa atin ay normal na lang.\n\nPagdating ko sa gate ng UP, natuwa ako dahil bagaman kailangan kong harapin ang mga bagay na kinatatakutan ko sa paglalakad, nagaalok rin naman ito ng pahinga sa mga bagay na pamilyar na. Ano pa nga ba ang paglalakad kundi ang paglalakad muli—ilang daang beses na'kong nakapunta sa gate na ito.",

    "content": "Research question: What is the best way to improve my editing and proofreading skills fast and cheap?\n\n## Brenner, E. (2022, February 17). For editors, by editors. *Right Touch Editing*. https://www.righttouchediting.com/2022/02/17/for-editors-by-editors/\n\nThis is a list of editorial training run by editors. Most of the courses linked her are paid although a few are also free.\n\n## Chartered Institute of Editing and Proofreading. (2023). Curriculum for professional development for editors and proofreaders. https://www.ciep.uk/assets/files/public/Curriculum-for-professional-development_v1.5.pdf\n\nThis curriculum divides an editor's work life into three domains:\n1. Working as a professional\n2. Editorial knowledge and practice\n3. Specialist skills and knowledge\n\nFor my project, domain teo is the most relevant.\n\n## Editors Canada. (2019). Career builder. https://www.editors.ca/sites/default/files/editorscanada-careerbuilder.pdf\n\nThis guide suggests a three-step plan\n1. Become part of the community of editors by networking.\n2. Augment your previous education and enhance your skills.\n3. Build your portfolio by finding work.\n\nSince my goal is to improve my editorial and proofreading skills so I could land a platform agency job by April or May 2023, I am going to skip steps 1 and 3 for now and all advice about the business side of editorial freelancing.\n\nOn enhancing one's skills, the guide advices that editors should take courses on punctuation, grammar, and style. It also advices on taking courses on querying, electronic editing, Word styles, and professional editorial standards, such as Editors Canada's own PES 2016.\n\nLater down the road, the guide advices that editors should start finding out what they are good at and what they enjoy doing and focus on these. There are four editorial disciplines to specialize in:\n- copy editing\n- structural editing\n- stylistic editing\n- proofreading\n\nFor general editing, the guide also suggests that editors invest in learning about:\n- editing for the web\n- plain language\n- fact checking\n- syntax\n- usage\n\nIt also suggests being familiar with tools and techniques, such as:\n- advanced Word\n- design for editors\n- editing PDFs\n- style guides\n\nFor more advanced training, the guide suggests learning about:\n- citation\n- macros\n- manuscript evaluation\n- SEO\n- medical, government, and other specialty areas\n\n## Hart, G. J. S. (2005). Improving your editing efficiency: Software skills, soft skill, and survival skills. https://www.geoff-hart.com/articles/2005/efficiency.htm\n\nHart argues that editors should aspire for efficiency by nurturing software skills, soft skills, and survival skills.\n\n### Software skills\n\nHart suggest that editors should review their processes and identify two kinds of tasks:\n1. Infrequent time-consuming tasks\n2. Frequent quick tasks\n\nOnce identified, software should be used to do them.\n\nSome suggestions Hart gave are:\n- Write a collection of standard queries that you routinely ask to authors and use a text expander to expand a shortcut you will use into the query. Write the query in a gentler way that provides a complete explanation of the problem and its potential solution. Alternatively, write these standard queries in a file that you can copy paste manually. For example, use this when querying missing citations.\n- Use macros for routine cleanups to remove double spaces, double paragraph returns, and other spacing problems.\n\nHart suggests that editors should create a list of all these annoying tasks and invest some time in learning how to use software to solve each of them in a regular basis, for example, once a week.\n\nHart suggests that editors should create templates for standardized write ups of their writers. To do so:\n1. Type all required headings and style accordingly.\n2. Add a one sentence prompt, styled correctly, that the writer can use to start writing on the section.\n3. Add subheading and bulleted lists if necessary.\n\nHart argues that editors should propose solutions and not just report problems. Further, editors should make their solutions easy to adopt by highlighting the results and not the steps that led to the results. To do so, Hart suggests the following:\n- Retype an entire misspelled word.\n- Copy a complicated sentence or paragraph into a comment and edit it there rather than retyping words form scratch. When authors copy your solution from the comment to the main text, they introduce fewer mistakes into the manuscript.\n\nHart also suggests mastering search and replace to fit your needs.\n\nOn a related note, Hart emphasizes the benefits of using a style sheet. In the style sheet, indicate the preferred choice and the forbidden variants. Then search for each forbidden variant and replace them with the preffered choice.\n\nHart also suggests learning how to use spellcheckers effectively by using custom and exclusion dictionaries.\n- A custom dictionary can be used for each project.\n- An exception dictionary can be used to flag correctly spelled words that couuld become mistyped versions of another word. For example: \"pubic health\" vs. \"public health,\" which vs. that, affect vs. effect.\n\nHart also suggests to do a single spellcheck at the end of editing to save time.\n\n### Soft skills\n\nHart provides useful insights that editors should keep in mind when working with authors, specifically when writing queries and limiting the scope of their revisions. Hart's advice are as follows:\n- Develop a soft touch and always encourage a friendly author–editor collaboration, being mindful that authors have fragile egos and the editing process can be easily seen as adversarial.\n- Before beginning work, learn about the goals of the author and agree on the scope of the revision based on those goals. When working, stay within the limits of that scope and focus on what is important to the author.\n- Always empathize with the author. Begin a project by preparing the author for what to expect. Clearly state that you plan on focusing on their needs and remind them that your focus will be looking for problems so your edits will provide a negative impression of the work. You can also ask them how you can make the editing process easier for them. For example, teach them to print manuscripts with revisions or create a primer on Word's revision tracking system.\n- Always make things easier for your author. Do this by asking your authors about the problems they face in the writing process and providing solutions to them that save time and effort. For example, you could offer to help them create detailed and effective outlines before they write (developmental editing). This will make your job as editor easier later on.\n- Persuade authors to accept your edits by using tactful language that frames queries into requests rather than demands. Use words like \"please\" and \"kindly\". Explain problems from your standpoint and do not attack the author.\n- Suggest reasonable changes and justify these changes.\n- Conclude and return your revisions on a positive note by giving an honest compliment.\n- Emphasize your willingness to work with the author to arrive at a mutually satisfactory revision.\n\n### Survival skills\n\nHart advices to adjust your schedule as an editor based on the weekly, monthly, and annual rhythms of your clients.\n\nAlso, editors should learn their own rhythms. For example, editors should perfom high-level, intellectually demanding editing tasks like substantive rewrites when they are most alert (like mornings), while reserving mindless tasks like editing citations and formatting bibliographies when they are less alert (like after lunch).\n\nHart also suggests the following process when editing:\n1. Edit errors that prevent readers from understanding the text (e.g., factual or logical errors).\n2. Edit errors that make comprehension difficult.\n3. Polish prose: eliminate typos and incoherence.\n\nHart also provides other time-saving advice:\n- Accept \"good enough\" edits when you know that you'll see the manuscript again for a second review.\n- Don't waste time trying to understand a difficult problem. Get moving and return to that section once other pages are done and you may have a better grasp of the problem. This applies a lot when revising the title or editing an abstract or summary.\n- Identify your editing bottlenecks and spend time learning about the problem and at least one solution. Further, try to implement a system to review these solutions repeatedly until you memorize them.\n\nHart also suggests creating your own innovative solutions for problems and sharing them with others.\n\n## O'moore-Klopf, K. (2023). KOK edit: Katherine O'moore-Klopf. http://kokedit.com/ckb.php\n\nLots of dead links.\nMaterials are old and un-updated.\n\nIn the page Education and Certification, there is this quote from Helen Schinskie about the value of formal training:\n\u003eI think training did give me a leg up in a lot of ways. I had done a good deal of desultory proofreading and editing before going in for a formal certificate program, but the class work really consolidated and clarified a lot of ideas I'd been a bit vague on before. I'd never really had proper feedback on what I was doing—either there wasn't time or the customer didn't know any better than I did. In fact, I'd been doing a lot of things right, but it was a great relief to know they were right and to get official credit for what I knew. I also made a bunch of local connections in the business that have been quite important to me.\n\u003e\n\u003eProbably nine-tenths of the benefit was psychological; if I'd had more chutzpah, I could have done just as well on my own. All the same, I really liked being part of a community of editors, and I liked getting pats on the back from my teachers. I came out of the training much more confident in my own ability to adapt and find my feet in the freelance world.\n\nThe general consensus among editors seems that training and experience are both necessary.",

    "title": "Atomic Habits — Clear (Book Summary)",
    "content": "\nIn _Atomic Habits_, James Clear details his system of behavior change based on his four laws. To establish habits that reinforce one's desired identity, Clear suggests that these habits should be: (1) made obvious, (2) made attractive, (3) made easy, and (4) made satisfying. On the other hand, to break habits that do not support one's desired identity, Clear argues that these habits should be: (1) made invisible, (2) made unattractive, (3) made hard, and (4) made unsatisfying. Clear ties these four laws and their inversions together with strategies like environment design, habit tracking, and deliberate practice to create a full-proof system for building good habits and breaking bad ones.\n\n### Introduction: My Story\n\nSuccessful habit change creates a sense of control over your life, which in turn creates self-confidence.\n\nChanges that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.\n\nWe all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.\n\nJames Clear's strategy involves: small habits, gradual evolution, and long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs.\n\nJames Clear's four-step model of habits: cue, craving, response, and reward.\n\nJames Clear’s four laws of behavior change evolved out of the four steps above.\n\nJames Clear’s framework is an integrated model of the cognitive and behavioral sciences. It accounts for both the influence of external stimuli and internal emotions on our habits.\n\nHuman behavior is always changing, but the fundamentals of human behavior do not change. They are lasting principles you can rely on. They are ideas you can build a business, family, and life around.\n\n## The Fundamentals: Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference\n\n### Chapter One: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits\n\n**The Aggregation of Marginal Gains.** Break down everything you could think of that goes into what you do + improve it by 1 percent = significant increase when you put them all together.\n\n**Habits are an investment.** Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them.\n\n**Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.** The small choices you take concerning your habits determine the difference between who you are and who you could be.\n\n**Focus on your current trajectory, not your current results.** It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success.\n\n**Habits are a double-edged sword.** You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.\n\n**The Plateau of Latent Potential.** Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. In order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. It will pay off after a certain amount.\n\n**Habits are like trees.** The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. The task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.\n\n**Forget about goals; focus on systems instead.** Results had very little to do with the goals you set and nearly everything to do with the systems you follow. Goals are good for setting a direction. Systems are best for making progress.\n\n**Improve for good by solving problems at the systems level.** Results are not the problem. We don’t have to change the results. What we need to change are the systems that lead to the results.\n\n**When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy.** You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.\n\n**Do not restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success.** A system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.\n\n**It is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.** True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.\n\nBad habits repeat themselves not because you have a problem but because your system is the problem.\n\n**The Atomic Habits System**\n\n- Small habits\n- Small habits that are part of a larger system\n- Atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.\n- Habits are the atoms of your lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement.\n- Habits build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment.\n- A regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do but also the source of incredible power.\n\n### Chapter Two: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)\n\n**The three layers of behavior change**\n\n1. Outcome change (changing your results)\n2. Process change (changing your habits and systems)\n3. Identity change (changing your beliefs)\n\n**The two directions of change**\n\n1. Outcome-based habits (start habit change by focusing on what one wants to achieve)\n2. Identity-based habits (start habit change by focusing on who one wishes to become)\n\nThere is an identity behind habits.\n\nBehavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.\n\n**Realize that your old identity can sabotage your new plans for change.** Before setting goals and determining your actions, consider the beliefs that drive the actions you want to take.\n\nThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes a part of your identity.\n\n**The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.** You start a habit because of motivation but you maintain it because it has become part of your identity.\n\nWhen your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.\n\n**Identity change is a double-edged sword.** You resist positive change because your old beliefs have been strongly ingrained in your psyche.\n\n**Don’t get too attached to one version of your identity.** Continuously edit your beliefs and upgrade and expand your identity.\n\n**The two-step process to changing your identity**\n\n1. Decide the type of person you want to be\n2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.\n\n**Your identity (your beliefs about yourself) emerge out of your habits (your experience).** Your habits are how you embody your identity.\n\nThe more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior.\n\nBuilding habits is the process of becoming yourself.\n\n**Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.** Your identity builds up as your votes build up. Habits create results and self-confidence.\n\n**Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time.** You don’t have to be perfect. It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for bad behavior.\n\n**The formation of all habits is a feedback loop.** Your habits shape your identity. Your identity shapes your habits.\n\n**It’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results.** The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.\n\n**The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.** You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today.\n\n### Chapter Three: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps\n\nHabits are memories of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past.\n\nAt the beginning of building a habit, your brain is busy learning the most effective course of action.\n\nYour exploring will eventually lead to a reward. Your brain begins to catalog the events that preceded the reward.\n\nWith the repetition of a behavior, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced.\n\nFacing a problem repeatedly automates the brain's response.\n\n**The feedback loop behind all human behavior**\n\n1. Try\n2. Fail\n3. Learn\n4. Try differently\n\n**Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it.** It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you create the mental space needed for free-thinking and creativity.\n\n**The four steps in building a habit**\n\n1. Cue\n2. Craving\n3. Response\n4. Reward\n\nThe human brain runs through these steps in the same order each time.\n\n**Cue is the information that predicts a reward.** It triggers your brain to initiate behavior.\n\n**Craving is the motivational force behind every habit.** Thoughts and feelings transform a cue into a craving. What you crave is not the habit itself, but the change in state it delivers.\n\n**Response is the actual habit.** It takes the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on (1) how motivated you are and (2) how much friction is associated with the behavior.\n\n**Reward is the end goal of every habit**. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.\n\n**If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit.** Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four steps, a behavior will not be repeated.\n\n**The habit loop**\n\n1. Cue triggers craving.\n2. Craving motivates a response.\n3. Response provides a reward.\n4. Reward satisfies the craving\n5. Craving becomes associated with the cue.\n\nThe habit loop is an endless loop that is running and active during every moment you are alive.\n\n**The two phases of the habit loop**\n\n1. Problem phase (cue, craving)\n2. Solution phase (response, reward)\n\nThe purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face (want to obtain something or want to relieve pain).\n\n**The four laws of behavior change**\n\n1. The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.\n2. The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.\n3. The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.\n4. The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.\n\nWhen all rules are satisfied creating good habits is effortless. When these rules are unsatisfied creating good habits is nearly impossible.\n\n**The inversion of the four laws of behavior change**\n\n1. Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.\n2. Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.\n3. Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.\n4. Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.\n\nUse the inversions to break a bad habit.\n\nThe key to creating good habits and breaking bad ones is to understand these fundamental laws and how to alter them to your specifications.\n\n## The 1st Law: Make It Obvious\n\n### Chapter Four: The Man Who Didn't Look Right\n\nYour ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation for every habit you have.\n\nOver time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are essentially invisible.\n\n**Begin the process of behavior change with awareness.** If a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. Recognizing your habits and acknowledging the cues that trigger them makes it possible to respond in a way that benefits you.\n\n**We need a point-and-call system for our personal lives.** We need to maintain awareness of what we are actually doing.\n\n**Habits scorecard.** This is a simple exercise to become aware of your behavior.\n\n**How to create a habits scorecard**\n\n1. Make a list of your daily habits.\n2. Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?\"\n3. If it is a good habit write “+” next to it.\n4. If it is a bad habit, write “-“ next to it.\n5. If it is a neutral habit, write “=“.\n\n**Reminders on doing the habits scorecard**\n\n- The marks that you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation and your goals.\n- As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change anything at first.\n- The goal is simply to notice what is actually going on.\n\n**Categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run.** Good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad habits will have net negative outcomes.\n\n**Categorize habits by how they will reinforce your desired identity.** Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.\n\n**There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits.** All habits serve you in some way, even the bad ones, which is why you repeat them.\n\n**Try point-and-calling.** Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be. Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences more real. This approach is useful even if you’re simply trying to remember a task on your to-do list.\n\n### Chapter Five: The Best Way to Start a New Habit\n\n**Implementation intention.** A plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. Leverages the two most common cues: time and location. Format: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.\"\n\n**How to create an implementation intention**\n\n- Fill out the following sentence: \"I will \\[BEHAVIOR\\] at \\[TIME\\] and \\[LOCATION\\].\"\n- Make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why.\n\nBeing specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you off course.\n\nWhen the moment of action occurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.\n\nStart a new habit on the first day of the week, month, or year because a fresh start is motivating.\n\n**Habit stacking.** A special form of implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit. This allows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behavior leading into the next.\n\n**How to apply habit stacking**\n\n- Identify a current habit you already do each day then stack your new behavior on top.\n- Habit stacking formula: “After \\[CURRENT HABIT\\], I will \\[NEW HABIT\\].\"\n- Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together.\n- You can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your current routines.\n- Consider when you are most likely to be successful. Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with something else.\n- Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit (if you daily, then daily).\n\n**How to find the right trigger for habit stacking**\n\n- The trigger must be highly specific and immediately actionable.\n- The more obvious the cue to your new habit, the better your chances are to act.\n\n### Chapter Six: Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More\n\n**The most common form of change is not internal, but external. We are changed by the world around us. Every habit is context-dependent.**\n\nBehavior is a function of the Person in their Environment: B = _f_(P,E)\n\nMany of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.\n\nVisual cues are the greatest catalyst for our behavior.\n\nLive and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.\n\nYou don’t have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.\n\n**If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment.** The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues.\n\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior.\n\n**Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships.** Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you.\n\nTrain yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context.\n\n**Habits can be easier to change in a new environment.** It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a different place or a different part of your place, and create a new routine there.\n\nIf you want to think more creatively, take a break from the space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns.\n\nWhen you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one.\n\n**“One space, one use.”** Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits and the easier ones will usually win out.\n\nIf your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces.\n\nA stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form.\n\n### Chapter Seven: The Secret of Self-Control\n\nAddictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a radical change in the environment.\n\n**\"Disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control.** They spend less time in tempting situations.\n\n**You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it.** Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely, even if they go unused for quite a while. Simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy.\n\nIn the long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in.\n\nNo one can consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment.\n\nEliminate your bad habit by reducing your exposure to the cue that causes it.\n\nInversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change: Make it invisible.\n\nInstead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment.\n\nMake the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.\n\n## The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive\n\n### Chapter Eight: How to Make a Habit Irresistible\n\n2nd Law of Behavior Change: The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.\n\nWhile it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, you can make any habit more enticing.\n\n**It is the anticipation of a reward, not the fulfillment of it, that gets us to take action.** Dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.\n\n**Desire is the engine that drives behavior.** Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.\n\n**Temptation bundling.** Link an action you want to do with an action you need to do.\n\n**Combine temptation bundling with habit stacking.** Formula: After \\[CURRENT HABIT\\], I will \\[HABIT I NEED\\]. After \\[HABIT I NEED\\], I will \\[HABIT I WANT\\].\n\n### Chapter Nine: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits\n\nBehaviors are attractive when they help us fit in.\n\nWe imitate the habits of three groups in particular:\n\n1. The close (family and friends)\n2. The many (the tribe)\n3. The powerful (those with status and prestige)\n\n**Imitate the close.**\n\n- To build better habits, join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day.\n- Take this strategy further by joining a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.\n- Remain part of the group even after achieving a goal to maintain your habits.\n\n**Imitate the many.**\n\n- When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive.\n- When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.\n\n**Imitate the powerful.**\n\n- We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status.\n- We are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status.\n\n### Chapter Ten: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits\n\nEvery behavior has a surface level craving, which in turn has a deeper underlying motive.\n\n**The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same.** The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.\n\n**There are many different ways to address the same underlying motive.** Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use.\n\n**Habits are all about associations**. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.\n\n**The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.** You see a cue. You make a prediction. That prediction leads to a feeling. You act based on this feeling that your prediction created.\n\n**A craving provides a reason to act.** Your craving is your desire to change your internal state because you sense that there is a gap between where you are now and where you want to be.\n\n**“It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.”** Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make a change. They help us decide the best course of action.\n\nWhenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again.\n\nYou can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience.\n\nReframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.\n\nCreate a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.\n\n**The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them.** Reprogram your predictions to transform a hard habit into an attractive one.\n\n## The 3rd Law: Make It Easy\n\n### Chapter Eleven: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward\n\n**You just need to get your reps in.** If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it.\n\nRepeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain.\n\n**Repetition is a form of change.** Simply putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit.\n\n**Automaticity.** All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior.\n\n**Habits form based on frequency, not time.** There is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habit formation. What matters is the rate at which you perform the behavior.\n\n**Make it easy.** To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective way to make practice happen is to make it easy.\n\n### Chapter Twelve: The Law of Least Effort\n\n**The Law of Least Effort.** When deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.\n\nThe less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur.\n\nThe greater the obstacle (the more difficult the habit), the more friction there is between you and your desired end state.\n\nMake your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it.\n\nYou could do the hard work on good days, but during tough days, you should be able to do the habit easily.\n\n**Use environment design to make actions or habits easier.** Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible and doing the wrong thing is as difficult as possible.\n\nHabits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life.\n\nAvoid starting habits in high-friction environments. Or lessen friction at home or office.\n\n**Addition by subtraction.** When we remove the points of friction that sap our time and energy, we can achieve more with less effort.\n\n**Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do.** Reduce the friction associated with good habits. Increase the friction associated with bad habits.\n\n### Chapter Thirteen: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule\n\nHabits are automatic choices that can be completed in just a few seconds but can shape the actions and conscious decisions that you take for minutes or hours afterward.\n\n**Decisive moments.** Moments in a day that deliver an outsized impact. They set the options available to your future self.\n\n**Decisive moments are important because our choice during a decisive moment sets the trajectory for how we spend the next chunk of our time.** Your options are constrained by what’s available. They are shaped by the first choice.\n\n**The Two-minute Rule.** When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.\n\n**Make your habits as easy as possible to start.** A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should be easy.\n\nTo figure out a gateway habit, map out your goals on a scale from \"very easy\" to \"very hard.\"\n\n**At the beginning, focus only on mastering the habit of showing up.** Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis.\n\n**A habit must be established before it can be improved.** You have to standardize before you can optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.\n\n**What happens after you master the art of showing up**\n\n- The first two minutes become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine.\n- The ritual is the ideal way to master a difficult skill.\n- The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely you get into a flow.\n\n**If the Two-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two minutes and then stop.** It’s not a strategy for starting, it’s the whole thing. Your habit can only last one hundred and twenty seconds.\n\n**The secret is to always stay below the point where it feels like work.** “The best way is to always stop when you are going good.” (Ernest Hemingway)\n\nIt’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.\n\nOnce you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up each day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with “habit shaping” to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal.\n\n1. Master the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior.\n2. Advance to an intermediate step and repeat the process (focus on just the first two minutes and master that stage before moving on to the next level.\n3. You’ll end up with the habit you had originally hoped to build while still keeping your focus on the first two minutes of the behavior.\n\n### Chapter Fourteen: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible\n\nMake your bad habits more difficult by creating a commitment device.\n\n**Commitment device.** A choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. A way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones while your mind is in the right place rather than waiting to see where your desires take you in the moment.\n\nThe best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act.\n\n**Onetime actions/choices.** Single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.\n\nYou may use technology to automate good habits and eliminate bad ones so that you can spend your effort on the tasks that machines cannot do yet.\n\nBy utilizing commitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and technology, you can create an environment of inevitability where good habits are guaranteed.\n\n## The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying\n\n### Chapter Fifteen: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change\n\n**Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change:** What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided.\n\nWe are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.\n\n**Immediate-return environment.** Your actions instantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes.\n\n**Delayed-return environment.** You work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.\n\nThe human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment.\n\nYou value the present more than the future.\n\nWith our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad.With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good.\n\nThe brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can’t rely on good intentions.\n\nThe more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.\n\n**Updated Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change:** What is _immediately_ rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.\n\nIf you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff.\n\nAt decisive moments, add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and add a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.\n\n**The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful even if it’s in a small way.** To stay on track, you need immediate rewards. They keep you excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background.\n\n**Reinforcement.** Ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish, thus increasing the rate of a behavior.\n\n**Use reinforcement when dealing with habits of avoidance.** Whenever you resist temptation, give yourself and immediate reward. This makes avoidance visible and makes doing nothing satisfying.\n\nSelect short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it.\n\n**Identity can become a reinforcer.** Eventually, as intrinsic rewards kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you.\n\nIt takes time for evidence to accumulate and a new identity to emerge.\n\nImmediate reinforcement helps maintain motivation in the short term while you’re waiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.\n\n### Chapter Sixteen: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day\n\nVisual measures reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity.\n\n**Habit tracker.** A simple way to measure whether you did a habit. Basic format: Get a calendar and cross off each day you stick with your routine.\n\n**Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change.** Habit tracking simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.\n\n**Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.** Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one. The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it. Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really going on each day.\n\n**Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.** The most effective form of motivation is progress. Through habit tracking, each small win feeds your desire.\n\n**Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.** Tracking can become its own form of reward. It is satisfying to mark an X on the calendar.\n\nHabit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic gratification.\n\nHow to make tracking easier?\n\n- Whenever possible, measurement should be automated.\n- Manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track ten.\n- Record each measurement immediately after a habit occurs. The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down.\n\nThe habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:After \\[CURRENT HABIT\\], I will \\[TRACK MY HABIT\\].\n\nEvery habit streak ends at some point. Have a good plan for when your habits slide off track.\n\nPerfection in being consistent with your habits is not possible.\n\n**“Never miss twice.”** The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.\n\n### Chapter Seventeen: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything\n\nInversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change: Make it immediately unsatisfying.\n\nAdd an instant cost to a bad habit to prevent it.\n\n**The strength of the punishment must match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct.** Behavior only shifts if the punishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.\n\nThe more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the consequence, the more likely it is to influence individual behavior.\n\nThe more global, intangible, vague, and delayed the consequence, the less likely it is to influence individual behavior.\n\n**Habit contract.** A straightforward way to add an immediate cost to any bad habit. A verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through. Then find one or two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you. It adds a social cost to any behavior because it makes the costs of violating promises public and painful.\n\n**Having an accountability parter is helpful.** Knowing that someone is watching can be a powerful motivator. Knowing that you will fail to uphold your promises to others is an immediate punishment. You can automate this process.\n\n## Advanced Tactics: How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great\n\n### Chapter Eighteen: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don't)\n\nHabits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities.\n\nGenes provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.\n\nCompetence is highly dependent on context.\n\nIf you want to be truly great, selecting the right place to focus is crucial.\n\nGenes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity.\n\nThe areas where you are genetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying.\n\nDirect your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability.\n\nBundled together, your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose you to a particular personality.\n\nIf you are not genetically inclined to a particular habit, use environment design.\n\nYou should build habits that work for your personality.\n\nThere is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and satisfaction. Find it.\n\nLearning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful.\n\nPick the right habit and progress is easy.\n\n**Explore/exploit trade-off**\n\n- Exploration at the beginning of a new activity\n- Goal: Try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net\n- After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution you’ve found, but keep experimenting occasionally.\n- If you are winning, you exploit. If you are losing, you explore.\n- Work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time, and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent\n- If you have a lot of time, explore. If you have little time, exploit.\n\n**Questions to narrow in on the habits and areas to focus on.**\n\n- What feels like fun to me, but work to others?\n- What makes me lose track of time?\n- Where do I get greater returns than the average person?\n- What comes naturally to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?\n\nWhenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.\n\n**If you can’t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor, create one.**\n\n- Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort.\n- Combine these areas to create your own game.\n- Win by being different.\n- Combine your skills to reduce competition and stand out.\n- Rewrite the rules to shortcut the need for a genetic advantage.\n\nA good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.\n\n**Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad genetics.** The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you.\n\nIf you can find a more favorable environment, you can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor.\n\nOur genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They tell us what to work hard on.\n\n**The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.**\n\n- We can know where to spend our time and energy.\n- We can know which types of opportunities to look for and which to avoid.\n\nFocus on whether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to someone else.\n\n**Work hard on the things that come easy.** To ensure that your habits remain satisfying over the long-run, pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills.\n\n### Chapter Nineteen: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work\n\nThe way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.”\n\n**The Goldilocks Rule (Yerkes-Dodson law).** Humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.\n\nWhen you are starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren’t perfect. Once a habit is established, it’s important to continue to advance in small ways, so that you are kept engaged. This will also get you to a flow state.\n\nYou need to regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress to stay motivated.\n\nDesire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and failure.\n\n**At some point, you will have to fall in love with boredom**. You should be ready to do the work even when it’s not convenient or exciting so that you become consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.\n\n### Chapter Twenty: The Downside of Creating Good Habits\n\nThe downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors.\n\n**Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery.** Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. You need a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice to become exceptional.\n\n**The process of mastery**\n\n1. Narrow your focus to a tiny element of success.\n2. Repeat it until you have internalized the skill.\n3. Use this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development.\n\nThe process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit-building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.\n\nTo avoid complacency, to make you aware of where to improve, and to ensure that you are spending your time on the right things, establish a system for reflection and review, which doesn't have to be complex.\n\nJames Clear’s two primary modes of reflection and review are his Annual Review and Integrity Report.\n\n**Annual Review.** (1) What went well this year? (2) What didn’t go so well this year? (3) What did I learn?\n\n**Integrity Report.** (1) What are the core values that drive my life and work? (2) How am I living and working with integrity right now? (3) How can I set a higher standard in the future?\n\nReflection and review also allows you time to revisit your identity.\n\n**As you latch on to a new identity, that identity can also hold you back from the next level of growth.** Your identity creates “pride” that encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from growing.\n\n**To prevent an identity from jeopardizing growth avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are.** Redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes.\n\nChoose a flexible identity, which works with the changing circumstances.\n\nLife is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check-in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCommit to tiny, sustainable, unrelenting improvements.\n\nSuccess is not a goal to reach. It is a system to improve, and endless process to refine.\n\nWhenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate through the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you find the next bottleneck. Round and round. Always looking for the next way to get 1 percent better.\n\nThe secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Little Lessons from the Four Laws\n\nHappiness is simply the absence of desire.\n\n- Suffering is the space between craving a change in state and getting it.\n\nPeace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems.\n\nEmotions drive behavior.\n\nWe can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional.\n\nYour response tends to follow your emotions.\n\n- Thoughts and actions are rooted in what we find attractive, not necessarily in what is logical.\n- To approach a situation from a more neutral emotional position allows you to base your response on the data rather than the emotion.\n\nSuffering drives progress.\n\n- The desire for a change in state is the source of all suffering and all progress.\n\nYour actions reveal how badly you want something.\n\n- If you keep on saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it.\n\nSelf-control is difficult because it is not satisfying.\n\n- Resisting temptation does not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it.\n\nFeelings come both before and after the behavior.\n\n- Cue -\u003e Craving (Feeling) -\u003e Response -\u003e Reward (Feeling)\n- How we feel influences how we act, and how we act influences how we feel.\n\nDesire initiates. Pleasure sustains.\n\nHope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance.\n\n- At the beginning, when there is no experience to give feedback, hope is high.\n- The second time, experience provides feedback to the initial expectation and hope declines. Hope is replaced by acceptance.\n",

    "content": "\nAutoethnography is an approach to research and writing that seeks to describe and systematically analyze (graphy) personal experience (auto) in order to understand cultural experience (ethno).\n\nA researcher uses tenets of autobiography and ethnography to do and write autoethnography.\n\nwhat social sciences would become if they were closer to literature than to physics, if they proffered stories rather than theories, and if they were self-consciously value-centered rather than pretending to be value free.\n\nways of producing meaningful, accessible, and evocative research grounded in personal experience, research that would sensitize readers to issues of identity politics, to experiences shrouded in silence, and to forms of representation that deepen our capacity to empathize with people who are different from us.\n\npersonal experience influences the research process\n\nEven though some researchers still assume that research can be done from a neutral, impersonal, and objective stance, most now recognize that such an assumption is not tenable\n\nautoethnography is one of the approaches that acknowledges and accommodates subjectivity, emotionality, and the researcher's influence on research, rather than hiding from these matters or assuming they don't exist.\n\nautobiographers write about \"epiphanies\"—remembered moments perceived to have significantly impacted the trajectory of a person's life, times of existential crises that forced a person to attend to and analyze lived experience, and events after which life does not seem quite the same.\n\nepiphanies reveal ways a person could negotiate \"intense situations\" and \"effects that linger—recollections, memories, images, feelings—long after a crucial incident is supposedly finished\"\n\nWhen researchers do ethnography, they study a culture's relational practices, common values and beliefs, and shared experiences for the purpose of helping insiders (cultural members) and outsiders (cultural strangers) better understand the culture\n\nEthnographers do this by becoming participant observers in the culture—that is, by taking field notes of cultural happenings as well as their part in and others' engagement with these happenings.\n\nAn ethnographer also may interview cultural members, examine members' ways of speaking and relating, investigate uses of space and place, and/or analyze artifacts such as clothing and architecture, and texts such as books, movies, and photographs\n\n==When researchers do autoethnography, they retrospectively and selectively write about epiphanies that stem from, or are made possible by, being part of a culture and/or by possessing a particular cultural identity. However, in addition to telling about experiences, autoethnographers often are required by social science publishing conventions to analyze these experiences.\n\nan autoethnographer must\n\n==\"look at experience analytically. Otherwise [you're] telling [your] story—and that's nice—but people do that on Oprah [a U.S.-based television program] every day. Why is your story more valid than anyone else's? What makes your story more valid is that you are a researcher. You have a set of theoretical and methodological tools and a research literature to use. That's your advantage. If you can't frame it around these tools and literature and just frame it as 'my story,' then why or how should I privilege your story over anyone else's I see 25 times a day on TV?\" (personal interview, May 4, 2006)\n\nAutoethnographers must not only use their methodological tools and research literature to analyze experience, but also must consider ways others may experience similar epiphanies; they must use personal experience to illustrate facets of cultural experience, and, in so doing, make characteristics of a culture familiar for insiders and outsiders. To accomplish this might require comparing and contrasting personal experience against existing research, interviewing cultural members, and/or examining relevant cultural artifacts\n\nAn autobiography should be aesthetic and evocative, engage readers, and use conventions of storytelling such as character, scene, and plot development, and/or chronological or fragmented story progression.\n\nAn autobiography must also illustrate new perspectives on personal experience—on epiphanies—by finding and filling a \"gap\" in existing, related storylines.\n\nAutobiographers can make texts aesthetic and evocative by using techniques of \"showing\", which are designed to bring \"readers into the scene\"—particularly into thoughts, emotions, and actions—in order to \"experience an experience.\" Most often through the use of conversation, showing allows writers to make events engaging and emotionally rich.\n\n\"Telling\" is a writing strategy that works with \"showing\" in that it provides readers some distance from the events described so that they might think about the events in a more abstract way. Adding some \"telling\" to a story that \"shows\" is an efficient way to convey information needed to appreciate what is going on, and a way to communicate information that does not necessitate the immediacy of dialogue and sensuous engagement.\n\nAutobiographers also can make a text artful and evocative by altering authorial points of view.\n\nSometimes autobiographers may use first-person to tell a story, typically when they personally observed or lived through an interaction and participated in an intimate and immediate \"eyewitness account.\n\nSometimes autobiographers may use second-person to bring readers into a scene, to actively witness, with the author, an experience, to be a part of rather than distanced from an event.\n\nAutobiographers also may use second-person to describe moments that are felt too difficult to claim.\n\nSometimes autobiographers may use third-person to establish the context for an interaction, report findings, and present what others do or say.\n\npatterns of cultural experience—repeated feelings, stories, and happenings—as evidenced by field notes, interviews, and/or artifacts\n\n==When researchers write autoethnographies, they seek to produce aesthetic and evocative thick descriptions of personal and interpersonal experience. They accomplish this by first discerning patterns of cultural experience evidenced by field notes, interviews, and/or artifacts, and then describing these patterns using facets of storytelling (e.g., character and plot development), showing and telling, and alterations of authorial voice. Thus, the autoethnographer not only tries to make personal experience meaningful and cultural experience engaging, but also, by producing accessible texts, she or he may be able to reach wider and more diverse mass audiences that traditional research usually disregards, a move that can make personal and social change possible for more people (BOCHNER, 1997; ELLIS, 1995; GOODALL, 2006; HOOKS, 1994).\n\nThe forms of autoethnography differ in how much emphasis is placed on the study of others, the researcher's self and interaction with others, traditional analysis, and the interview context, as well as on power relationships.\n\n==Narrative ethnographies refer to texts presented in the form of stories that incorporate the ethnographer's experiences into the ethnographic descriptions and analysis of others. Here the emphasis is on the ethnographic study of others, which is accomplished partly by attending to encounters between the narrator and members of the groups being studied (TEDLOCK, 1991), and the narrative often intersects with analyses of patterns and processes.\n\n==Reflexive ethnographies document ways a researcher changes as a result of doing fieldwork. Reflexive/narrative ethnographies exist on a continuum ranging from starting research from the ethnographer's biography, to the ethnographer studying her or his life alongside cultural members' lives, to ethnographic memoirs (ELLIS, 2004, p.50) or \"confessional tales\" (VAN MAANEN, 1988) where the ethnographer's backstage research endeavors become the focus of investigation (ELLIS, 2004).\n\nLayered accounts often focus on the author's experience alongside data, abstract analysis, and relevant literature. This form emphasizes the procedural nature of research. Similar to grounded theory, layered accounts illustrate how \"data collection and analysis proceed simultaneously\" (CHARMAZ, 1983, p.110) and frame existing research as a \"source of questions and comparisons\" rather than a \"measure of truth\" (p.117). But unlike grounded theory, layered accounts use vignettes, reflexivity, multiple voices, and introspection (ELLIS, 1991) to \"invoke\" readers to enter into the \"emergent experience\" of doing and writing research (RONAI, 1992, p.123), conceive of identity as an \"emergent process\" (Rambo, 2005, p.583), and consider evocative, concrete texts to be as important as abstract analyses (RONAI, 1995, 1996).\n\n==Personal narratives are stories about authors who view themselves as the phenomenon and write evocative narratives specifically focused on their academic, research, and personal lives (e.g., BERRY, 2007; GOODALL, 2006; POULOS, 2008; TILLMANN, 2009). These often are the most controversial forms of autoethnography for traditional social scientists, especially if they are not accompanied by more traditional analysis and/or connections to scholarly literature. Personal narratives propose to understand a self or some aspect of a life as it intersects with a cultural context, connect to other participants as co-researchers, and invite readers to enter the author's world and to use what they learn there to reflect on, understand, and cope with their own lives (ELLIS, 2004, p.46)\n\nIn using personal experience, autoethnographers not only implicate themselves with their work, but also close, intimate others\n\nAutoethnographers thus consider \"relational concerns\" as a crucial dimension of inquiry\n\nOn many occasions, this obligates autoethnographers to show their work to others implicated in or by their texts, allowing these others to respond, and/or acknowledging how these others feel about what is being written about them and allowing them to talk back to how they have been represented in the text. Similar to traditional ethnographers, autoethnographers also may have to protect the privacy and safety of others by altering identifying characteristics such as circumstance, topics discussed, or characteristics like race, gender, name, place, or appearance. While the essence and meaningfulness of the research story is more important than the precise recounting of detail (BOCHNER, 2002; TULLIS OWEN et al., 2009), autoethnographers must stay aware of how these protective devices can influence the integrity of their research as well as how their work is interpreted and understood. Most of the time, they also have to be able to continue to live in the world of relationships in which their research is embedded after the research is completed.\n\nIn particular, autoethnographers ask: \"How useful is the story?\" and \"To what uses might the story be put?\" (BOCHNER, 2002).\n\nAutoethnography, as method, attempts to disrupt the binary of science and art. Autoethnographers believe research can be rigorous, theoretical, and analytical and emotional, therapeutic, and inclusive of personal and social phenomena. Autoethnographers also value the need to write and represent research in evocative, aesthetic ways (e.g., ELLIS, 1995, 2004; PELIAS, 2000). One can write in aesthetically compelling ways without citing fiction or being educated as a literary or performance scholar. The questions most important to autoethnographers are: who reads our work, how are they affected by it, and how does it keep a conversation going?\n\nAutoethnographers view research and writing as socially-just acts; rather than a preoccupation with accuracy, the goal is to produce analytical, accessible texts that change us and the world we live in for the better (HOLMAN JONES, 2005, p.764).\n\n## References\n\nEllis, C., Adams, T.

    "content": "\n![Dew on a leaf](dew-on-leaf.jpg)\n\nIf good things happen in the future but what is true is only the present moment and that—as Marcus Aurelius repeats in his [[Meditation — Aurelius (Book Summary)|Meditations]], anytime we could die—, then the wisest choice of action is to strike a balance between working towards a better future while making sure you are doing something you absolutely have to do right now.\n\nFor example, one of my goals is [[essays/a better definition of financial freedom|financial independence]]. However, the \"real\" motive behind this goal is to experience [[How I Became a Professional Multipotentialite|creative freedom]], that is, the freedom to do something I care about when I want to do it. I want to be able to do something for the sake of doing it, not because I need to earn money or achieve prestige.\n\nTrading off five to ten years of my life to work hard so I can eventually achieve financial freedom and delay the pursuit of my interests puts me at a terrible risk: I could die prematurely, not achieve financial independence, and, worst, not explore my interests. How much better will it be if, along the way to financial independence, I intentionally free myself with some small packets of time to dip my toes in my interests?\n\nAs I argued in [[essays/a better definition of financial freedom|a previous article]], even if we aren't perpetually financially free when we aren't financially independent, we can still be financially free at specific moments—moments when we choose to do something without the intention of making money. It is still possible to experience financial and creative freedom \"now\" as you walk towards financial independence.\n\nI think this is one of the upsides of building a lifestyle business while waiting for one's investments compound. When a business is built right, it can provide passive income \"right now\"—passive income that investments are only able to provide in the future. This passive income can create the possibility of mini-retirements that one can take on the path to financial independence. Mini-retirements then remove the risk of dying early without being able to do the things that one lives for.\n\nIt is possible to work for one's future without unnecessarily sacrificing ALL the opportunities that one can take advantage of right now.\n\nWe only live once. We only live in the present moment.\n",

    "content": "\nAccording to [[Sascha Fast]], the term “Barbell Method\" came from [[Nassim Taleb]], which refers to an investment strategy where you combine safety and the possibility of high revenue by putting the majority of your investments in safe vehicles while you make small but very risky bets.\n\nWhen applied to reading, we invest more time and energy on “safe” investments: useful parts that are either difficult or easy to understand. To do this, Fast suggests doing two levels of reading:\n1. Simply reading the text and marking what seems relevant and useful.\n2. Going back to the highlights and writing zettels on them.\n\nThe Barbell Method of reading described by Sascha Fast has similarities with the [[Progressive summarization]] of [[thoughts/tiago forte]]. However, it is simpler and doesn't require a summary like progressive summarization does. I designed a process that combines the best of the two: [[Combine progressive summarization with Talahardin]].\n\n# References\n\nFast, S. (2018, May 25). *The Barbell Method of Reading*.

It is sitting contentedly, but when a strong wind shakes the tree, it looks a little concerned. It is easier to draw than the Yellow-vented Bulbul (_Pycnonotus goiavier_). It is much more stable. It only moves its head. Does it owe this lack of movement from a fairly large body? I remember [Ricky Baker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPaU4Gymt3E) while looking at it. I've sen _bato bato_ alone many times. Perhaps this one doesn't have a mate. Perhaps _bato bato_ love being alone.\n\nThe life of a bird is as interesting as its death. Last night, I saw a dead bird in the middle of the road. I saw its beak and realized that it was not one of the common birds, at least not one you'll expect to see dead in the middle of the road. It looked like a _sikling_. Perhaps it was crossing the street the exact moment a car or a motorcycle or a tricycle passed by. There was blood. I picked it up and put it on the side of the road on top of the grass that was just wetted by the storm.\n\nRelated: [[poems/bato-bato]]",

Establish relationships with portals who can help you find at most 150 outer core members and three to 10 inner core friends.\n9. Find friends with whom you can do everything with and who could love one another as a collective.\n10. Introduce the rule: No shit-talking or sneaking around behind one another's backs. Promote honesty, inclusivity, and transparency. If we had a problem, we would talk to the person we had a problem with, not someone else.\n11. Be intentional to hangout with your inner and outer core community regularly.\n12. Every year (either during your annual review or birthday), reassess your outer and inner core communities by writing each of your friends' names down and being really honest with yourself as to how you are showing up for them and they for you.\n13.

    "title": "Billy Collins Teaches Reading and Writing Poetry",
    "content": "\n## 01 - Introduction: The Pleasure Poetry Gives Us\n\nThe typical Billy Collins poem opens on a clear and hospitable note but soon takes an unexpected turn; poems that begin in irony may end in a moment of lyric surprise.\n\nBilly sees his poetry as “a form of travel writing” and considers humor “a door into the serious.”\n\n\"Poetry is really the only history we have of the human heart.\"\n\nThe real pleasure of writing a poem lies in figuring out how to engage and maintain the reader's interest, and the way to do that is through form.\n\nAll the fun's in how you say a thing. It's not what you say, but how you say it.\n\nPoetry predates prose fiction by thousands of years. At the same time, poetry is a sudden occurence.\n\nThe brevity of the lyric poem mean that every word counts; even the space you leave on the page are part of what a poem delivers. Every poem has a shape.\n\nI see poetry as the highest form of human expression, but the making of a poem involves the nuts and bolts of writing strong lines and solid stanzas.\n\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge caled poetry \"the best words in the best order.\"\n\nI think of a poem as a flashlight, an instrument of discovery.\n\nPoetry is a way of seeing life and establishing a connection to the world.\n\nPoetry, in this sense, is perhaps a way for readers and writers to experience a different sort of timeline: one that experiences histories not in terms of boundary disputes, inventions, truces, and wars, but through the way such events have made us feel. Poetry is a living history of the human heart: a testament to the romance, rather than linearity, of time.\n\nEssay: \"Poetry, Pleasure, and the Hedonist Reader\" in The Eye of the Poet: Six Views of the Art and Craft of Poetry (Oxford University Press, 2001).\n\nThe pleasures of poetry:\n- pleasure of dance (rhythm)\n- pleasure of sound (words)\n- pleasure of travel (using written work to transport us to different worlds)\n- pleasure of metaphoric connection (surprise and new perspectives)\n- pleasure of companionship (memorization)\n- others\n\nTravel is a good metaphor for poems: start somewhere you know, end up in an unfamiliar place.\n\nPoetry is romance of time. Time is running out. Carpe diem! Live more.\n\n## 02 - Working with Form\n\n### **The Love of Strangers**\n\nWriting is all about the love of strangers.\n\nPoetry starts as a covert activity.\n\nPoems are expression of feelings that are no longer embarassing.\n\nPoetry is a diary without the lock, a diary you want people to read.\n\n### **Connect With Strangers Through Form**\n\nForm is anything that keeps a poem together.\n\nThe reader comes to a book of poems not because they are interested in you but because they love poetry.\n\n**To connect to your reader, you need to tell a lie that you love poetry more than you love yourself.**\n\nShow that you love poetry (not just self-expression) through form.\n\n**Yates: \"All that is personal will rot if it is not packed in ice and salt.\"** (ice and salt means rhyme and meter)\n\nRhyme and meter are the preservatives that kept poetry together for centuries.\n\n### **The Shapeliness of Poetry**\n\nBlank space is silence. Poetry is a displacement of silence. Prose is a continuation of noise.\n\nPoetry has a shape.\n\nAn airtight definition of poetry from Henry Taylor:\n\n\u003eA poem is an arrangement of lines whose length is determined by some principle other than the width of the page.\n\nThe poem is always guiding back your attention into a compress shape.\n\n### **The title**\n\nThe title is the welcome mat or marquee outside a movie theatre.\n\nDo not sum up the poem in the title.\n\nTitles shouldn't draw too much attention or be puzzling. Titles should create access to the first few lines.\n\n### **The first few lines**\n\nThe first few lines of the poem should contain something that is easy to accept.\n\nStart with the setting of where you are. Do not make demands. Just make it easy. Once the reader is inside the room , you can shut the door, and you can start making demands.\n\nAnalogy: eye chart\n\n### **Line and stanza**\n\nWhen he starts a poem, he writes in sentences. After he writes the first sentence, he assumes that that will be a stanza. If it needs four lines to get that out, it is a quatrain.\n\nAfter that, he writes another quatrain.\n\nEach stanza is a standalone stanza.\n\nAfter writing three stanzas and the poem feels boxy, he lets it go. Perhaps it is meant to be a three-line stanza.\n\nIf the poem still does not want that, he considers using stanzas with unequal length.\n\nStanza = room (in Italian). You are taking the reader into a tour room by room.\n\nHow to end a line?\n- Don't cut a line into two unprofitably. For example:\n\t\tThe whiskers of\n\t\tthe cat\n- When you cut lines unintentionally, your reader gets distracted.\n- Let the lines form the progress of the reader\n\nPoem example: Elk River Falls\n\n### **Writing exerise**\n\nGo on a walk and bring your notebook. Look around and take down some observations on the external stimuli around you—a tree, a person, a neighborhood, a pool. See if you can begin a poem by using some of these external elements. Once you’ve got the poem underway, have you made a decision about what your stanzas will look like? Will you use enjambment or will you use punctuation? Do you want the poem to go slowly or faster? Do you want to use long sentences or short?\n\n### Writing exerise\n\nThink about the stanzas as various “rooms” in the house of the poem. Imagine that the poet is taking readers through various rooms in a tour of a house. Now, read one of your own poems and look at the stanzas: in the margins of your poem, write down what each stanza or “room” is revealing.\n\n### Reading exercise\n\nUse very specific detaails—the particulars of experience—to keep the story achored to external reality. Use detail to achor a poem.\n\nUse incoclusive or \"soft endings.\" Do not try to solve the problem.\n\nA soft ending—when a poem just ends in an image—can work.\n\nRead Anton Chekhov's\n- Misery\n- The Lady with the Lap Dog\n\n### Writing exercise\n\nWrite a few lines setting a scene that is easy to accept. Think about the example of snow on pine trees or a dog lying under a hammock. Establish a scene of your own. Then have your poem take a twist. Take your reader and yourself somewhere very different—spatially or thematically—from your original scene.\n\n## 03 - Discovering the Subject\n\n### **Write What You Want to Write About**\n\nDon't be someone who adheres to the rules so much that you don't write about what you really want to write about.\n\nWrite poems about subjects that have never been written about yet.\n\nExamples of poets who have written in unchartered territories\n- To a Locomotive in Winter by Walt Whitman\n- Satan Says by Sharon Olds (anger to parents)\n- The Sense of Movement by Thom Gunn (Elvis Presely)\n- Oatmeal by Galway Kinnell\n\nThe choice of subject is where you can exploit the imaginistic potential of poetry.\n\nYou can be anywhere, you can do anything, you can be anything in poetry.\n\n**### The Subject You Start With and the Subject You Discover**\n\nA poem progresses from a small thing to a big thing, from a concrete thing to an abstract thing. See The Triggering Town by Richard Hugo.\n\nPoetry has two subjects:\n1. The subject you start with\n2. The subject you discover as you go along\n\nThe first subject just starts the poem but leaves it once you discover what the poem is really about.\n\nRead: The Lanyard by Billy Collins\n- The word lanyard triggered the image of the object, which triggered a memory of making a lanyard in camp, which triggers a memory of his mother.\n\n### **Don't Think About the Theme**\n\nWhen composing poetry, you can let go of thinking about the theme and instead think:\n- How does a poem go?\n- How does a poem behave?\n\nSee How Does a Poem Mean? by John Ciardi\n\nInstead of extracting the poem's meaning and throwing it away to go somewhere else, spend more time in thinking about how the poem develops.\n\nPoems don't come down from heaven. They're from real people, written by real hands through trial and error.\n\nThink of a poem as a moving thing: think of the hydraulics of the poem, the travel of the poem, the turning points, how the poet is working, and how is it ending.\n\nThink of the poem as sniffing out a way into itself not really knowing where it is going and then discovering a way to end.\n\n### **Know When to Be Clear and When to Be Mysterious**\n\nClarity and mystery is in every poem. Each has a place in poetry.\n\nGood poems were written by poets who know when to be clear and when to be mysterious.\n\n## 04 - Writing the Poem\n\n### Carry a Little Notebook\n\nBilly does not sit down to write. When he sits down, he already has something in his mind to write about.\n\n\"You are not a poet all the time but you can be a poet you're not writing poetry.\"\n- Look around and observe images.\n- When you sit down to write, you are more relaxed.\n\n### Jump-Start Your Writing\n\nWordsworth talks about a \"wise passivity\": open yourself up by settling your mind in a meditative way and wait for things to come in.\n\nMore active ways to trigger your writing\n\n1. Take a poem of someone else's and write an imitation.\n2. Use someone else's first line.\n3. Write five first lines in different pages and see which ones lead to second or thirds.\n4. At the end of the day or in the morning of the next one, write 20 things you did that day or the day before. Don't write chronologically. Just write as things pop out. Wait for connections between the lines to come.\n\n### Start at the Beginning\n\nBilly writes at the beginning until it ends. He seldom writes through backfilling (starting at the end).\n\nHe writes a poem in one sitting. Readers could sense a mosaic poem that has been written in the course of months and where words were changed.\n\nStick with the poem until its done. You can't be in the same river twice.\n\n### Let the Poem Guide You\n\nIf there is something that is distracting you while you are writing the poem, put it in the poem. Maybe it belongs there.\n\nDon't be too stringent. Let the poem lead you to one way or another.\n\nWilliam Butler Yates differentiated\n1. Poems written by memory - lesser type as they describe what you already know and remember; recounts past experience\n2. Poems written by imagination - unpredictable and unexpected\n\nLet go of the topic. Let surprise surprise you.\n\n\"Hold the pen lightly.\"\n\n\"Enter the poem without deadly commitment to staying with the topic.\"\n\n\"Have a literary sense of adventure.\"",

    "title": "Bubuli",
    "content": "\nI am sitting on my office chair, looking at the gleaming green leaves that block my view of Makiling. All of a sudden, I see a bubuli crawling around the branches of a thin tree that was growing just outside the window of my office. I am not sure whether it is even right to call this a tree. Its kind just grows whenever the rain comes. We've had a lot of rain in the past few days and boy do these \"trees\" grow fast! The owner of the piece of land outside my window had these cut a few months ago. Now they'e back with vengeance, blocking my once clear view of the mountain's summit.\n\nAt first, the bubuli seems to be going down this one thin branch. Suddenly, it went back up the same branch as if it realized that it was going the wrong way. Before it even reaches the tip of the branch, which was seems too small to carry the lizard's weight, the bubuli reversed into a leaf stem. The leaves of this tree are larger than most trees. But they are less thick than the already thin branch that holds the bubuli. And yet it felt like the creature was so sure that the leaf stem will be able to carry its weight. It proceeded without any hesitation or fear—talk about lizard brain!\n\nFrom the leaf stem, it was only a few seconds before the bubuli reached the large leaf and no stem supports it! Naturally, its weight pulled the lighter leaf, which started to bend down. At the exact moment when the bubuli seems to fall from the leaf, the animal jumped acrobatically to where it was really going—to the sturdier trunk of another tree. It crawled down fast before I can even blink my eyes again.\n\nI was rewarded with a penny—as Annie Dillard so skilfully described in her book. It's not very often that I see something at the back of my office and so when I do, I know I really need to see it. Have I seen other things while looking out of this office window? The sunset, of course. One tie, I also watched the old man patiently harvest the dragon fruits that crawled up a tall palm tree, which he cut eventually. And there was also the Christmas eve morning when the muslims were chanting and it was so clear, the contrast.",

The river is wide under the bridge but begins to be narrow as the trail progresses. One can either pass on the trail above or the grassy trail below. But one needs to use the upper trail to progress. Talahib is all around. It is the main kind of vegetation in the trail. Silent. Few dogs along the settlements and afar. You will encounter a few residents either tending with their grazing cows, strolling along the river side, or diving in the river possibly for fish. Cordillera is visible ahead the trail although much cloud.\n\nThe trail also has arms going down the river itself where it has dried and it’s possible to actually walk on. Birds fly but don’t perch on anything as there are not much trees only shrubs. Birding might be difficult here. There is a large pond where water from the river seems to be trapped when it is low. This is where people fish and dive.\n\nThe trail doesn’t seem to connect to another road so one needs to go back to the highway.\n\n## Photos\n\n### Maps\n\n![IMG_6387.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/395F7069-8FEC-463E-B4D8-B176732AEECC/14FDBBC9-9D8C-4F8A-B8ED-22D66B55234B_2/IMG_6387.png)\n\n![IMG_6388.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/395F7069-8FEC-463E-B4D8-B176732AEECC/0A10FCC9-065D-41F9-875D-9CC756FB46C9_2/IMG_6388.png)\n\n![IMG_6394.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/395F7069-8FEC-463E-B4D8-B176732AEECC/D23FF46A-7CCA-4270-BCCC-376D67E1C4AA_2/IMG_6394.png)\n\n![IMG_6395.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/395F7069-8FEC-463E-B4D8-B176732AEECC/A87510D4-B77C-4583-957C-92310182BA39_2/IMG_6395.png)\n\n![IMG_6396.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/395F7069-8FEC-463E-B4D8-B176732AEECC/4BFE60B2-E467-490E-A027-50F390A81CE7_2/IMG_6396.png)\n\n![IMG_6397.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/395F7069-8FEC-463E-B4D8-B176732AEECC/5D587727-2705-4963-8E3D-B9D83F0B9E71_2/IMG_6397.png)\n\n",

    "title": "Cairns to Mark the Journey",
    "content": "\nAll of us are travelers.  \n\nEven for the many of us who spend most of their time at home (pandemic or not), we are traveling.  \n\nWe are traveling the longest, most picturesque travel we can take: the journey of life itself.  \n\nAlong this journey, we tread to valleys and peaks, and most of these look a lot like the next valleys and peaks that we will be walking through. The only way we can get through these future valleys and peaks is to remember how we got to similar situations in the past.  \n\nWhat are you doing to help yourself remember?  \n\nAlso, as we stay longer in this journey of life, we realize that travelers join us, younger and less experienced travelers who badly need someone to guide them along their own path. You know you have the knowledge that they can use to survive the journey. But will you remember your hard-earned wisdom when it's time for you to impart them to those who need them the most?  \n\nThese questions suggest that we all need markers, cairns that mark specific spots we reached along our journey. When we build these cairns, they serve not just as a reminder for ourselves but as a lesson for those who are yet to go through the things we already went through.  \n\nKnowing this, I have endeavored to write annual reviews every end-of-the-year. Since I started in 2013, I have written seven reviews that serve as cairns for myself and for anyone who might use them. When I relaunched my blog in 2017, I chose not to include my old annual reviews from 2013-2016. However, recently, as I'm starting to forget how much I have gone through in the past years and as I meet more people who could use some help in the same subjects and challenges that I went through, I decided to republish them here.  \n\nI'm sharing them in this newsletter with anyone who might be interested to read them.  \n\nHere are the annual reviews and some synopsis on what they contain.  \n\n[[My 2019 Annual Review|My 2019 Annual Review]]\n\n- Reviews the different achievements and major shifts I went through in 2019 including practicing intermittent fasting, transitioning to editing as my major livelihood, returning to drawing, reading Thoreau, and finding a new relationship after going through a breakup. It also tells about my struggles with tinnitus.\n\n[[My 2018 Annual Review|My 2018 Annual Review]]\n\n- Talks about the grieving process I went through after ending a six-year-long relationship. Also shares my first attempts in establishing daily creative routines to explore new passions like poetry, photography, translation, and philosophy.\n\n[[My 2017 annual review|My 2017 Annual Review]]\n\n- Tells about how I found different communities that support my different passions (a writing community, a meditation community, and a permaculture community). It also talks about my relaunch of this website, my attempts (and, again, failures) to live a sustainable life, and my first serious encounter with the mind-blowing world of philosophy.\n\n[[My 2016 annual review|My 2016 Annual Review]]\n\n- Shares about a year full of books—books that helped me understand my place in the bigger scheme of things, specifically in the material world, and how this relates to my attempt to create a fulfilling creative life.\n\n[[My 2015 annual review|My 2015 Annual Review]]\n\n- Narrates my adventures (and failures) in my first attempt to live in Metro Manila for an extended period of time, which led me to go back home to the province to recuperate and give more time to my creative pursuits. Tells about a year filled with travels and “spiritual” discoveries.\n\n[[My 2014 annual review|My 2014 Annual Review]]\n\n- Reviews the ups and downs (mostly downs) of my first year after college. It also contains goals that I set myself for 2015.\n\n[[My 2013–2014 annual review|My 2013–2014 Annual Review]]\n\n- Tells about the different challenges I faced the first year after college. It also narrates how I tackled the question, “What will I do with my life?” which led me to start a blog and work online.\n\nPlease forgive my subpar writing in these reviews, especially in the first ones. I edited them very minimally before publishing because I want to preserve my former way of thinking and writing. That is their purpose anyway: to be a time capsule of past mental states.\n\nWhether you read the reviews or not, I hope you appreciate the importance of keeping track of your own life journey, whether through annual reviews, journaling, oral history recordings, or photographs.\n\nJust build some form of marker that will help you remember the journey. You will need it when things get tough.\n",

    "title": "Career capital theory",
    "content": "\nThis is what [[Cal Newport]] calls the theory he deduced from the several interviews he did for his book *[[So Good They Can't Ignore You — Newport]]*. I have a feeling that there are existing academic resources that uses the same arguments.\n\nThe theory has three main arguments:\n1. The traits that make a job desirable are scarce and prize.\n2. Careers are subject to the rules of supply and demand.\n3. The craftperson mindset helps you build career capital.\n\nOn statement 1, I agree that the things Cal points out as most desirable in an ideal career (autonomy, a sense of mission, and creativity) are indeed coveted as compared to the mundane tasks involved in less desirable jobs that don't have none of these three. But are they really as scarce and coveted as Cal tells us they are? Do we really need to compete with each other just to have autonomy, a sense of mission, and creativity in the work we do?\n\nOn statement 2, I think it is critical because it justifies statement 3. Cal argues that because the coveted traits of ideal careers are scarce and prized, we only get them if we exchange something scarce and prized. That currency we use to pay for autonomy, a sense of mission, and creativity in our careers is a scarce and prized skill developed through hours of deliberate practice motivated by a craftperson's mindset, advocated in statement 3.\n\nCal uses these arguments to ditch the follow your passion advice and preach that passion follows skill. Be good at something and you end up loving it.\n\nIt is now clear to me that the reason why the career capital theory is an incomplete theory is that it treats all work as something integrated into the exchange economy and is completely silent about human activity that are best contextualized in a [[Gift economy]].\n\nI don't fully resonate with the career capital theory because it completely ignores this element in its discourse on what makes work and an entire career worthwhile. It merely looks at work as something exchangedd with an exact value, whereas the work that I do, I see it more as a gift with no exact value. I refuse to treat the game as a competition. The deepest thing I want to do comes to me as a gift and I want to give it to the world as a gift. This might look from the outside like I am simply \"following my passion\" but it isn't as simple as that.\n\nRelated\n\n- [[Early and semi-retirement could allow one to live in the gift economy]]\n- [[Some important work have to be done even if they are not profitable]]\n\n# References",

    "title": "Celebrate Obscurity",
    "content": "![A journal entry](journal-entry.jpg)\n\nThere are two ways that people approach creativity, either consciously or unconsciously:\n\n1. Creativity as a celebrity game\n2. Creativity as an authenticity game\n\nNeither is right or wrong. People who look at creativity through each lens are looking at it the right way. However, we have a cultural bias that favors the first option.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If you are a writer you need to get published.\n- You need to win an award.\n- People need to know about you. You have to live in public.\n- You need to have x number of followers.\n- You need to earn x number of income from royalties, etc.\n\nAgain there is absolutely nothing wrong with all these goals. But we have to recognize that there exists a cultural bias over these goals, which have not always resulted in good things.\n\nSome examples:\n\n- The majority of people expect creatives to have a following. If they don’t have one, they’re just “hobbyists”, which is synonymous with being amateurs.\n- Because society expects artists to have a following, many who have a creative itch are frightened by the prospect of engaging in the creative process.\n- People leave their creative endeavors after burning out from trying so hard to “make it”.\n- Many creatives sacrifice other important areas of their lives for the sake of \"success\". What's sadder about this is that society actually celebrates people who sacrifice everything just to be \"great\".\n- Society distinguishes between good art (“high art) and bad art (doodles, punk art, and the like) raising the barrier to entry for creative pursuits in certain circles too high for most people.\n- Creativity is institutionalized and pigeonholed into hierarchies.\n- The creative marketplace has transformed into a dog-eat-dog environment where you either make it or you die (sometimes, literally).\n\n## The Celebrity Game\n\nMuch of society’s ideas of creativity and art revolve around the celebrity game. However, if you are an artist and you play the celebrity game, you have to face some hard facts:\n\n1. People’s attention has become more and more scarce over the years, thanks to the Internet and social media, which made the barrier to entry to content creation so low.\n2. Winning the celebrity game almost always requires you to compete. You have no choice about this.\n3. In specific instances, you can make it by playing the authenticity game but we shouldn’t forget the role of “luck” in these instances. Making it in the creative world just by being authentic is not the norm (for more on this, see the work of [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://hbr.org/2014/01/life-is-luck-heres-how-to-plan-a-career-around-it)).\n\n## The Authenticity Game\n\nThe alternative of the celebrity game is of course the authenticity game. What is the authenticity game?\n\n- Aspire for authenticity first.\n- Aspire for doing what feels good.\n- Stop treating your art as the be-all and end-all of your life.\n- Prepare for mild success (i.e., doing your best work based on your own standards, not that the standards of other people, and training yourself to be ready when “luck” works for you and you get a big break).\n- When a celebrity opportunity arrives, remember to reflect on the cons, not just the pros.\n\n## The Benefits of Obscurity\n\nThere are some benefits of obscurity. [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/2018/07/05/you-dont-have-to-live-in-public/) said in _Steal Like an Artist_:\n\n\u003e Soon after, you learn that most of the world doesn’t necessarily care about what you think. It sounds harsh, but it’s true. As the writer Steven Pressfield says, “It’s not that people are mean or cruel, they’re just busy.\n\u003e\n\u003e This is actually a good thing, because you want attention only after you’re doing really good work. There’s no pressure when you’re unknown. You can do what you want. Experiment. Do things just for the fun of it. When you’re unknown, there’s nothing to distract you from getting better. No public image to manage. No huge paycheck on the line. No stockholders. No e-mails from your agent. No hangers-on.\n\u003e\n\u003e You’ll never get that freedom back again once people start paying you attention, and especially not once they start paying you money.\n\u003e\n\u003e Enjoy your obscurity while it lasts. Use it.\n\nThis is where I admire [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]] so much. Yes, he was able to make a name for himself while he was alive, but he was never a big hit like J.K. Rowling was or similar big names in literature. Even when he started gaining traction in writing books and lecturing, he always recognized the tension between fame and his desire to be authentic in the work that he does.\n\nFor example, he stopped giving lecture tours when he noticed that they took away the time he spends in nature and when he noticed that his audience were just looking for formulaic presentations that forced him to be inauthentic just to please them. Furthermore, his journal was done in private and was never really meant to bring him fame. And yet he viewed it as his most important work.\n\nI’m sure there are other examples of artists who played the authenticity game rather than the celebrity game game.\n",

Bugbee's Inward Morning was inspired by Marcel's Being and Having.\n\nHocking, Marcel, and Bugbee introduced a non-absolutist version of idealism in the 20th century. Other contributors were Benedetto Croce, R. G. Collingwood, José Ortega y Gasset, and John William Miller.\n\nThis neoidealist lineage is akin and estranged with Dewey's version of pragmatism (\"[[Instrumentalism]]\"), which argues that \"knowledge results from the discernment of corrrelations between events, or processes of change.\"\n\n***\nA complete rejection of certainty leads to the \"thinly lived, aesthetic existence\" of [[Postmodernism]]. We might not have absolute certainty (except for the [[The three laws of logic]]), but we need at least a [[Working certainty]].

My sense is that this is an overreaction based on a somewhat narrow consideration of what the history of philosophy has been about. I think also that Hocking, Marcel, and Bugbee are agreed on this. For them, philosophy does involve the need for at least a working certainty, and I believe their work provides a basis for understanding philosophy as a quest for certainty once the notion of certainty itself is revised and reoriented.\n\u003e\n\u003eMy walking seems first to require some sort of certainty to initiate it. My instinctive or abductive guesses about where and how to plant my feet seem guided, even if only in a minimal way. Moreover, as a practice, the walking of the rocks seems to generate another kind of certainty in the confidence it produces. I come to rely on my ability to negotiate the trip down the brook.

I love the specific storytelling poems she writes but occassionally she writes these \"preachy\" poems and one of them is this, *Invitations*. It is a poem about doing things for the sake of doing them—not doing them for others, not doing them for money, but doing them entirely for oneself and one's own pleasure.\n\n[[Mary Oliver]] thinks this is a principle of living—a full-blown strategy that could change lives. Whether or not one approaches life in this fashion determines the quality of his life. I share this belief with her, [[Charles Eisenstein]], [[Lewis Hyde]], and [[Austin Kleon]].\n\nDoing things for the sake of doing them, living in the gift, doing nothing, having full creative freedom, not thinking about pleasing people, or an audience, not showing oneself as an unchanging brand.\n\nThis view of life reminds us of the value of not having anything else other tha just being alive.\n\n\u003eIt is a serious thing just to be alive\n\nWhen we strive for goals, we sometimes cloud and forget the immensity of this wonder: We are just alive! You need time to realize that. You need idleness to realize that. You don't realize that in the middle of a corporate meeting! Pause. Realize that be grateful for being alive. Do nothing, do something with no benefit or reward.\n\nThis is why I believe in hobbies, in not selling ALL of your passions and idleness. We need these to be present to this one life.\n\n# References",

Especially for the most skeptical among us, commitment is not an easy matter - whether that's commiting to an idea, a new career, a set of beliefs, a community, a partner - it takes a lot of time and effort to arrive at commitment! Sometimes, if not most of the time, it takes years of trial and error, of heartbreaks and failures, before commitment happens.\n\nBefore commitment, clarity first occurs in the form of an insight or a gut-feel, which sort of reorganizes our entire inner universe. This insight or gut-feel creates a \"Hell, yeah!\" moment where one becomes so sure of one's decision. Sometimes, we respond to this moment once it occurs. Often, we need to repeatedly feel it to really align with it.\n\nA sad but true tangent in all of these is that some clarity arrives only through loss. I was dipping my toes sort of into poetry these past few years, but never really felt committed to it. Only after my friend and poetry mentor died this year did it became clear to me that poetry will be part and parcel of the life I will be building forward.\n\nSad how I arrived into this insight, but it is something I feel compelled to celebrate still.",

    "title": "Conversation with Rem on Being vs. Thinking",
    "content": "\nOk nagegets na kita. I’ll try to articulate kung paano kita hindi naintindihan noong una. I think it all boils down to how you used the word “thinking”. Meron akong sariling definition nito na hindi nagmatch sa definition mo.\n\nSidebar lang about definitions. Naniniwala ako na walang objective na definition. Bawat isang tao ay may kaniya-kaniyang gamit sa isang salita. Halimbawa, ang salitang bahay ay idedefine ng isang palaboy kaiba sa definition ng isang haciendero. Ang kahulughan natin sa isang salita ay napaka-personal at may kaniya-kaniyang imahe at kaisapan tayong naka-attach sa kaniya. Kaya worthless pagdebatehan ang proper definition ng isang salita—dahil walang iisang definition. Ang dictionary ay pinagsama-samang kuro-kuro lang ng lipunan (specifically, mga nakapag-aral na lingguists) sa kung paano gagamitin ang isang salita. So ang isang salita ay maaring gamitin entirely different from one society to another. Wala silang objective existence. Sa tingin ko, ito ay isang malaking source ng hindi pagkakaunawaan sa lipunan. Maraming hindi pagkakaintindihan ang maiiwasan kung umupo muna ang mga parties involved para i-clarify kung ano ang ibig nilang sabihin sa mga salitang ginagamit nila.\n\nAko personally, imbes na iimpose ko sayo ang personal definition ko sa isang salita, I would rather ask you first ano yung ibig mong sabihin nung ginamit mo ang salitang yun, tapos ilalatag ko katabi ng sarili kong definition nung salita at titignan ko kung saan sila nagkakaiba. That way mas maiintindihan kita. At yun yung ininitiate kong gawin rito haha.\n\nNow based sa mga sinabi mo, mukhang mas naipaliwanag mo ng mabuti kung ano ang ibig sabihin nung non-thinking. So I guess, yun ang ipaparaphrase ko rito. Tapos from that, babaliktarin ko lang para maarticulate ko ang definition MO ng thinking:\n\nSo para sayo, hindi tayo nag-iisip kapag:\n\n- Lumalabas ang mga imahe at insight sa isip natin ng kusa at hindi ginagamitan ng pagrarason (i.e., ito ang dahilan nito, dahil dito naging ganito kaya ganito, etc.).\n- Random ang mga dumarating na imahe at insight.\n- At dahil random sila, hindi ka sigurado at hindi mo sila maiintindihan kaagad.\n- Kailangang gamitan ng pagrarason upang maintindihan ang random imahe o insight.\n- Minsan ang dumarating ay rebelasyon na random rin pero hindi ambiguous, sa halip ginagawa nitong malinaw ang mga bagay-bagay.\n- Sa prosesong ito, may malay pa rin tayo (conscious).\n\nBased from these, ang kabaliktaran naman nito na pag-iisip based sayo ay:\n\n- Pagpapalabas ng mga imahe at insight sa isip ng inentional at ginagamitan ng mas maraming effort at pagrarason.\n- Ang pag-iisip ay paglikha ng istrutura.\n- Dahil may istruktura, may pagkakasunod-sunod ang mga kaisipan at naiintindihan sila.\n- Hindi na kailangang gamitan pa ng pagrarason upang luminaw, dahil pagrarason na ito mismo.\n- Dumarating ang konklusyon sa dulo ng pagrarason (sa halip na rebelasyon). Ang konklusyon ay ang produkto ng paghahabi ng mga inilatag na kaisipan.\n- Sa prosesong ito, may malay din tayo (conscious).\n\nSo yan ang definition mo ng thinking based on definition mo ng non-thinking. Naiintindihan na kita at super nag-aagree ako sa difference ng dalawa. Namisunderstood lang kita dahil heto ang definition ko ng pag-iisip:\n\nPara sa’kin, once may malay ka (i.e., hindi ka patay, wala ka sa coma, o hindi ka baliw), automatic gumagana ang utak mo, gumagana ang isip mo, therefore, nag-iisip ka na.\n\nNgayon kapag may malay ka at gumagana ang utak mo, nagbabago ang intensity ng pag-iisip na yun based on kung ano ang ginagawa mo o nangyayari sayo. Kapag gumagamit ka ng logical argumentation or reasoning, intense ang pag-iisip mo. Ang tawag ko dito ay reasoning o pagrarason. Ngayon, kapag nag-oobserve ka lang, nagiging present, nagmemeditate, may malay ka parin, gumagana pa rin utak at isip mo, therefore nagiisip ka parin, PERO hindi ka nagrarason—nanunuod ka lang at nag-aantay sa kung ano ang darating. Ito na yung katumbas nung definitions mo ng non-thinking sa itaas.\n\nEto, as usual, diniagram ko:\n\n![IMG_0283.jpeg](IMG_0283.jpeg)\n\nAng resolusyon ko mula ngayon ay tatandaan ko ang diagram na ito tuwing gagamitin mo ang mga salitang “hindi nag-iisip” o “hindi gumagamit ng logic”.\n\nTuwing gagamitin mo ang mga salitang yan, ipapaalala ko lang sa sarili ko na ang ibig mong sabihin (based on my personal definitions), ay “being”.\n\n# References\n",

Go through photos, mark them as interesting and put them in a General folder. No categories etc. The General folder is set as a target collection. When you go through photos, anything that is mildly interesting, you hit B and this puts the photo into the General folder. Be liberal in this first pass.\n2. Go through the target collection a couple of times, then move to another target collection: Cull #1. This cull is about looking at the details of each photograph, the light, the patterns. You delete what you know you will never use. You identify what photos are worth spending time at.\n3. After this, there will be two more steps of edits, deeper that will happen in an iPad. At this point, CM doesn't touch contrast.\n\nDoing this process for photos taken in a long period of time would show where your photographic style changed.\n\nFor CM, his photographic style changed in 2018 after his first vipassana retreat and after he did his first 10-day solo walk. Solitude is a non-negotiable for him when he wants to take good photos.\n\nFor his book project, he looked for 100 images he is excited about and cull that into a max of 60.\n\nCM duplicates photos and does tons of edits on them. CMD + apostrophe.\n\nWhen you pull down the highlights too much, photo goes to HDR mode.\n\nReduce nois by lessening luminance and adding clarity.\n\n4:5 portrait is so much better than 2:3 for portrait.\n\nThe next step is how these images you've chosen align with the narrative you are writing.\n\nIn 2016, CM started to move away from nature photography he was doing before into building and texture.\n\nAutofocus sometimes feels like you are losing control especially with slow photography.\n\nShoot underexposed because it gives you more freedom in editing.\n\nCM thought what if we shoot domestic life like laundry and start to ignore the cliches of oriental shrines.\n\nFor a book about place, you will need a photo that shows a bird's eyeview of the entire space.\n\nCM is fond of decreasing the highlights liberally to -100\n\nSynology\n\nDo not overly obssess on framing. You want to have good framing because a lot is unsalvageable but that's it.\n\nYou don't want to create a book with photos that are in lots of other books.\n\nIt's so easy in photography to get lost in technical goofery without actually producing work.\n\nDoing long walks, and doing those long walks a couple of times would show you patterns of humanity in display.\n\n# References\n\nCraig Mod.

I have never played paintball or laser tag. I wish I had my own scooter and Gundam robot. The remote-controlled car I had was a cheap version I bought for myself.\n\nThere are many things I never get to try when I was a child. I remember harboring feelings against my father because he can't give me what I wanted. I still feel some of that pain when I enter a toy store today.\n\nAnd yet, despite all of it, I'll exchange everything I have now to be a child even for just a day.\n\nI would pick up a stick, wear a blanket for a cape, and create imaginary characters and scenes that I alone will act out on the go. I will bring out my action figures (or whatever is left of them) and make them fight each other for one more championship. I will look for a _santol_ leaf and cut some of it to create a dragon. I will cut out TEKS characters and create stories out of them. I will create an entire metropolis out of legos. I will create my own board game and play it with my cousins. I will draw comic strips on a composition notebook.\n\nSuch freedom.\n\nSuch creative freedom.\n\nI know I could never be that child again but thinking about this now makes me ponder about what I really desire deep down as an artist. And this is what I want: creative freedom. Child-like creative freedom.\n\nI honestly don't care about fame, achievement, and the money and power that come with them. **_All that really matters to me is the freedom to create what I want when I want._** Because that is the kind of creative life I knew and loved when I was a child. And even if I can't be that child again, even if I can't retrieve that purity, I can always design my creative life in a way that allows this playful child-like existence to flourish.\n\nHere are some rough pointers I think could help me honor child-like creative freedom. If you share the same desire, these pointers might help you too:\n\n1. [Try not to have a goal.](https://zenhabits.net/goal-less/) Just start a creative session with curiosity. Let your imagination loose. Follow where it brings you.\n2. Try out different things. Stop sticking to a single creative media. Try out other crafts. It doesn't matter if you're not good at any of the new ones. What matters is you've tried out something new that you can mix up with all the other things you're already doing. Then let all of them talk to each other and see what comes out. I do this with poetry, translation, drawing, storytelling, and photography.\n3. Don't be too serious about your creative life. Just play and have fun.\n4. Run from artist groups or workshops that will disrespect your work. Avoid them like the plague. Look for your tribe and create for them instead. They are the ones whose feedback really matters anyway. You can do this by starting a blog or publishing a newsletter featuring your work to slowly build your audience.\n5. [Find a day job](https://puttylike.com/dont-let-anyone-shame-you-for-having-a-day-job/) that does not suck out all your creative energy and allows you to play around after (or even before) work.\n6. [Always get in touch with what you want to feel out of the creative process.](/accessing-ginhawa-directly/) A lot of the time, we forget that we do things for the feelings, states of mind, or experiences they generate. Being conscious that feelings are the goal and being mindful of what you want to feel every step of the creative process will connect you with what really matters. It will also help you decide whether to accept or reject a creative opportunity.\n\nBonus: [Read Keri Smith's powerful list of things to avoid as an artist.](http://www.kerismith.com/blog/how-to-feel-miserable-as-an-artist/)\n\nHappy creating!\n",

He previously called it \"contemplative philosophy\" and \"philosophical companionships.\" It was born out of his disatisfaction from academic philosophy's emphasis on absract reasoning and [[Philosophical practice]]'s distancing from what Lahav calls the \"original philosophical mission\":   Creating inner transformations while connecting to the foundation of reality.\n\nDeep philosophy has four main tenets:\n\n1. Contemplate on fundamental aspects of life (i.e., philosophize).\n2. Contemplate from our inner depth.\n3. Contemplate texts from the history of philosophy.\n4. Contemplate with others to transcend our  individual viewpoint.\n\nI am attracted to deep philosophy because it is both intellectually responsible, yet \"personally deep and meaningful.\"\n\nUpdate: After getting more acquainted with it, I no longer share this impression. Deep philosoph is heavily Eastern and mystical, which tends to outrightly reject metaphysics and epistemology and relegates abstract reasoning as secondary to experience and “intuition”. Deep philosophy claims to combine both intuition and reason, but it isn’t very clear where reason and abstract reasoning fits in its model. It cannot escape the two but like Eastern philosophy, it denigrates it and puts it below emotions and experiences. It could be right. But I am not yet sure I am ready to accept this conclusion.\n\n# Related\n\n- [[A rejection of metaphysics and epistemology is proof of the necessity of the two]]\n- [[How will I philosophize?]]\n\n## References",

It is the first form of writing I do in the morning.\n\nA diary writing session has been successful if I achieved these:\n\n1.

After listening to his stories, I dug him up on the internet where I found his site. There, I made an even more interesting find, which I will later on use in my own creative process.\n\nJames regularly goes out into the wild, in different parts of the world, to find inspiration for his art, writing, and research. He calls these visits [\"fieldworks.\"](https://www.troutsite.com/field.html) He had a few fieldworks on fishes, one on a rare orchid, and another on monarch butterflies. At that time, I was already making daily walks and bike rides around my locale, taking photos of the surroundings and writing notes on my phone. These afternoon escapades where time spaces when I could just commune with nature, my body, and the creative muse. I didn't really gave these everyday adventures a name. Not until I learned about James' fascinating work. Since then, I stole James' language and started calling my afternoon bike rides \"fieldworks.\" Doing so made my daily adventures more interesting.\n\nMy creative process while doing my afternoon fieldworks usually involves the following:\n\n1. I ride my bike to a particular spot: a dirt path, a road, a hill, a small piece of forested land, anywhere that is mostly silent and secluded. I do my fieldworks around 5:00 in the afternoon when farmers are making their journeys back home and the nice spots begin to welcome the silent evening.\n2. When I reach a nice spot, I begin to walk, towing my bike beside me and stoping to write notes about or take photos of interesting things I see in the environment.\n3. When I feel like writing a poem, I sit on the grass or under the tree as I wait for the words and the rhymes to come.\n4. While sitting, I take the time to watch the clouds, breathe the fresh air, and just be with the present moment.\n5. I usually make the ride home before 7:00 when there is still a few light left in the sky.\n\nYesterday, after reading this interview with [Austin Kleon](https://extraordinaryroutines.com/austin-kleon/), I decided to add something new to my process: for the first time, I brought a physical notebook and a pen with me in my fieldwork. Before yesterday, it was always just me and my phone.\n\nI really think this small change made a huge difference in my fieldwork yesterday. I noticed that I was more intentional with how I communed with my surroundings. I think this is what really happens when we revamp our creative processes. Creativity is about creation after all, and nothing gets created without \"change.\"\n\nWhen I reached my spot, I got off my bike and started walking. Then, I took the following photos.\n\n![Unharvested crops of mais](corn_fields_san_jacinto.jpg \"Unharvested crops of mais\")\n\n![Waiting for chickens to finish their snack before I pass](cow_chicken_san_jacinto.jpg \"Waiting for chickens to finish their snack before I pass\")\n\n![Electric tower, the field, and the sky](electric_tower_san_jacinto.jpg \"Electric tower, the field, and the sky\")\n\n![Leaves with the electric tower as backdrop](electric_tower_leaves_san_jacinto.jpg \"Leaves with the electric tower as backdrop\")\n\n![A stretch of farm irrigation at San Jacinto](irrigation_san_jacinto.jpg \"A stretch of farm irrigation at San Jacinto\")\n\n![My favorite dirt road](dirt_road_san_jacinto.jpg \"My favorite dirt road\")\n\n![Trees conversing with the sunset](trees_sunset_san_jacinto.jpg \"Trees conversing with the sunset\")\n\nAfter taking the photos, writing a short note about the terrain, walking, and trying out a new path, I sat down under a favorite tree and wrote on my notebook. No one else was in the field at this time: just me, my notebook, and birdsongs.\n\n![Field notes over dried leaves and straw](fieldnotes_straw_san_jacinto.jpg \"Field notes over dried leaves and straw\")\n\nAfter scribbling on my notebook, I drew the terrain in front of me. I haven't drawn for a long time now, so I'm quite proud of my humble sketch. It's the view of the Cordillera ranges from where I sat yesterday.\n\n![My attempted sketch of the field](sketch_san_jacinto.jpg \"My attempted sketch of the field\")\n\nAfter finishing the sketch, I closed my notebook, strapped it back on my bike carrier along with the pen, and rode my bike home.\n\nAdventures don't always have to be big to be awesome. They can be as equally rewarding when we do them with full intentionality . . . and when we introduce little changes such as bringing a physical notebook and a pen for the first time.\n",

    "content": "\nA monothetic definition of religion with multiple criteria, which treats religion as a multidimensional complex, can be double-sided when it includes both substantive and functional approaches. In this definition, a set of beliefs about reality influences the behavior of practitioners. The definition of William James ([[Religion involves a belief in an unseen order per James]]) and Clifford Geertz ([[Five elements of a religion per Clifford Geertz]]) are both double-sided.\n\n# References\n\nSchilbrack, K. (2022). The Concept of Religion. In E. N. Zalta (Ed.), The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2022). Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University. https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2022/entries/concept-religion/\n\n\u003eIt is worth noting that when a monothetic definition includes multiple criteria, one does not have to choose between the substantive and functional strategies for defining religion, but can instead include both. If a monothetic definition include both strategies, then, to count as a religion, a form of life would have to refer to a distinctive substantive reality and also play a certain role in the participants’ lives. This double-sided approach avoids the result of purely substantive definitions that might count as religion a feckless set of beliefs (for instance, “something must have created the world”) unconnected from the believers’ desires and behavior, while also avoiding the result of purely functional definitions that might count as religion some universal aspect of human existence (for instance, creating collective effervescence or ranking of one’s values).\n\u003e \n\u003e William James’s definition of religion (“the belief that there is an unseen order, and our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto”) is double-sided in this way, combining a belief in the existence of a distinctive referent with the spiritual disciplines with which one seeks to embody that belief. Geertz’s definition of religion also required both substantive and functional aspects, which he labelled “worldview” and “ethos” (1973: ch. 5). To treat religion as “both/and” in this way is to refuse to abstract one aspect of a complex social reality but instead recognizes, as Geertz puts it, both “the dispositional and conceptual aspects of religious life” (1973: 113).\n\u003e \n\u003e These “monothetic-set definitions” treat the concept of religion as referring to a multifaceted or multidimensional complex.\n",

    "content": "\nIn some way, early retirees or even semi-retirees short-circuit the rules of the career capital theory by simply decreasing their reliance to the market exchange economy itself. By doing so, they are less affected to the law of supply and demand. By not needing to work for money, one can have autonomy, creativity, and a sense of mission and all other desirable traits absent in a mundane job. In artistic industries where competition is cutthroat, early retirement provides an alternative for the artist to get the things they want from a career without necesarily going through the alleged competition needed to have a happy career. I am reminded here of Mary Oliver's words from Wild Geese:\n\n\u003eYou do not have to be good.\n\u003eYou do not have to walk on your knees\n\u003efor a hundred miles through the desert repenting.\n\u003eYou only have to let the soft animal of your body\n\u003elove what it loves.\n\nNot everyone wants to aspire for greatness and fame. Autonomy is enough for most of us. There is no need to compete. One just needs to feel good. And perhaps if I am required to compete and to look at career-building as a way to get ahead of others, then I really am not sure I want to do what everyone else is doing.\n\nCareer capital makes a lot of sense when money is involved. You can negotiate a higher pay to your coveted skills if you have career capital. But if you need less money and you just want to enjoy autonomy and focus on family and the good life, a simple spiritual and religious life, you can get out of the race. Isn't this equally coveted? A spiritual, philosophical, and religious career might defy the theory of career capital because of their element of renunciation.\n\n# References",

As I took another step, I grabbed both of my backpack's shoulder straps to pull them forward away from my chest. As I did this, I felt my bag’s soft but warm cushion on my back, and the pain on my shoulders subsided. On my left, two dump trucks moved like tortoises climbing a rock. Behind them, a long line of cars started to form. I didn't expect this eight-mile stretch from the town of Calauan to San Pablo City to be this elevated—one of the many other things I forgot to prepare for in this walk. This elevated artery, which reminded me a lot of the Aspiras–Palispis Highway of Benguet, was by now the hardest part of the walk, mainly because it had almost no shade and no sidewalks. The sun was peaking and it burned my legs and feet—feet that are in pain of blisters.\n\nAs I continued walking toward a sharp curve, a shadow formed in front of me. The shadow was casted by a small tree. After laying down my backpack on the ground under the shade, I rested the left side of my body on the tree and grabbed my phone from my right pocket. I looked at the time. It was already 10:37 in the morning. I can't believe I have been walking for the past two and a half hours with a backpack that probably weighed more than ten kilos. I turned to my right, and that was when I saw it—one of the three summits of Mt. Banahaw, the active complex volcano of Laguna, often associated with the supernatural. Mt. Banahaw peered behind thick foliage, as if watching, even mocking me for the fool I made myself become. It was there when the questions came to me: “Why am I doing this? Why am I walking?”\n\n\\***\n\nOn June 9, 2022, I walked over 22 kilometers from my apartment at Los Baños to San Pablo City, Laguna. The walk that took 35,000 steps to complete in more than 5 hours started along the busy Lopez Avenue at Los Baños and traversed 5 kilometers of the Manila South Roud, passing by the town of Bay, before turning right toward Calauan for another 5 kilometers. From Calauan, the walked turned into a 10-kilometer hike on a highway with a 630 feet elevation en route to San Pablo. The following morning, I walked an extra 22,000 steps, to go around Sampaloc Lake and visit nearby Bunot Lake. I went home that afternoon by riding a jeep that covered what I walked for five hours the day before in just around 30 minutes—a surreal experience.\n\nDays after the walk, I continued to revisit that questions that came to me while staring at Mt. Banahaw. Why was I walking? I have been walking for almost my entire life, but I've never questioned my motivations for doing so—not until the long walk to San Pablo. At first, I struggled to piece together a coherent answer. I was surprised that thinking about my motivation for walking directed me to supposedly unrelated existential issues, a lot of which concern my past and current identities. After reviewing my journal entries, it became clear to me that walking, for me, has become a way to traverse the distance between identities—that liminal space between what I like to call my Old Self and my New Self and finally come face-to-face with my New Self Becoming.[^1]\n\n## A Liminal Wilderness\n\nThe concept of liminality emerged during the 20th century through works written in three disciplines: ethnography, architecture, and cultural anthropology. In all of these disciplines, liminality was defined as a state of being in-between. Arnold van Gennep first used the word in the book \"Les Rites de Passage\" (1908) to describe the second phase of a three-phased structure of rites: separation, transition, and reincorporation. For Gennep, transition was always deliberate and voluntary. An individual launches themself into a disoriented state of liminality to transcend their former identity. In the 1950s, the concept entered architercture through the work of Aldo van Eyck, who expressed human transcience through the geometry of circles and rectangles. The architecture of liminal spaces sought to combine being in space and being in time as individuals interact with geometrical parameters.\n\nThe cultural anthropologist Victor Turner reintroduced liminality to anthropology in the 1960s, focusing on its psychosocial nature. For Turner, liminality is subjectively experienced and expressed by an individual. He likened it to death, being in utero, and the wilderness (Turner, 1966, p. 95). He described it as \"a realm that has few or none of the attributes of the past or coming state\" (Turner, 1987, p. 47). Separation from one's old identity launches one into a vast existential expanse, the *limen*, where one's \"throwness\" (Dahistrom, 2013) becomes even more pronounced. Such experiences of being \"neither here nor there\" (Turner, 1966, p. 94) slowly engulfs us into an identity blackhole where we forget that we are inside one.\n\nIn my past life, I was raised in a family of devout Jehovah's Witnesses, where the Bible was the central authority from which all behaviors were measured. Everything, from large decisions like when to enter a romantic relationship, when to engage in sexual activities, or whether to go to college or not, to smaller decisions like what clothes or hairstyles to wear, were dictated to us by a \"governing body\" of nine American men located in Brooklyn, New York, all white except one, through a sophisticated chain of command. I did not fully embrace the faith of my parents until I, despite the discouragement of members of our congregation and threats of my father's removal from his pastor duties, went to college and met other Jehovah's Witnesses who were able to balance religious responsibilities and college life. In three years, I dedicated every waking hour of my life to the faith, ultimately becoming a ministerial servant, a young pastor, at the age of 19, while serving in a congregation that catered to the Deaf and Hard of Hearing through sign language. I remember being at the end of my first semester in third year, feeling intensely like my entire life ahead of me was so clear. I belonged to a tight-knit community, I didn't have to think much about what to believe because everything was spoonfed to me, and I knew who I was and what I wanted to become: a missionary, bringing the doctrines of the religion into far places.\n\nAll of these began crumbling down on March 11, 2011, when I started developing symptoms of clinical depression. I was forced to file for leave of absence at my university to spend an entire year back home recovering. Recovering from depression was the most difficult thing I ever went through. I went to see a psychiatrist when the symptoms were already at their peak—insomnia, severe chronic fatigue, anxiety attacks almost every five minutes, suicidal ideations—and so I began medication late. To make matters worse, the meds did not immediately kick in. I had to endure the symptoms for more than a month before finding some relief. What happens to a devout religious young man in such circumstance is that he starts to question whether God has forsaken him. Then this thought leads to questioning whether what the community he belongs to tells him about God is correct.\n\nAfter finding equilibrium, I began questioning the very foundations of who I was raised to be as a person, including whether there is a God and if the religion where I belonged was indeed his church. This questioning culminated to me deciding to leave the religion of my childhood on April 2012. At that time, I was just following what felt right. Little did I knew that leaving a religion and a way of life that I spent the first 20 years of my life was like death or being in a wilderness—an existential wilderness (Turner, 1966). Abandoning my religion was abandoning my Old Self, which launched me right into a messy interstitial space, where identities are never yet final, and that I was always becoming someone I didn't yet knew who.\n\nThe state of liminality is characterized by flux; it is a state where identity shape-shifts and nothing is final. Individuals in a state of liminality tend to be more open to multiple ideas and meanings, as they attempt to recreate themselves. A period of liminality is a period filled of uncertainty and, in my experience, a difficulty to commit to almost anything [Cite]. After leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses in 2012, I went through a two-year exploration of atheism. Although I never really connected with the atheist community, I explored the its most radical forms. I started by reading books like *Bondage of the Mind* by R. D. Gold and *The Bible as History* by Werner Keller, which convinced me to reject that the Bible is the inspired word of God. Then I started questioning the very existence of a God.\n\nHowever, after a couple of years reading on atheism and humanism, I encountered Eastern philosophy. I read the Bhagavad Gita, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, and the Tao Te Ching. I listened to New Age gurus, learned yoga, and practiced meditation. It was at this time when I realized that I did not resonate well with angry radical atheists who wanted to eradicate religion. I thought that despite not identifying to any organized religion or spiritual groups, I was still deeply \"spiritual.\" I went around different spiritual circles: Zen, Advaita Vedanta, Hinduism, Buddhism, finding something, anything, that sticks. While I appreciate the experimental nature of being in these spiritual circles, where I am allowed to be in different groups at the same time, I also encountered intellectual animosity among many of them and sometimes a complete rejection of the rational. Two years around spiritual circles, I fell in love with philosophy, and this reconnected me to my rational, intellectual self.\n\nToday, I accept the fact that I am in some sort of psycho-socio-religious liminal state. Here, one goes back and forth between the structure of one's Old Self and the non-structure of one's New Self Becoming. I do not have a desire to associate to any organized religion or set of beliefs. I still don't think a personal God is necessary, but I also think he could exist. Perhaps, I have ceased to care too much about metaphysics altogether. But I am still deeply spiritual, deeply religious, and my intellectual self counterbalances that. As of the moment, I am resonating with the progressinve and liberal Free Religion concept of Shin'ichirō Imaoka (1881–1988).\n\nDespite my religious identity (and my identity in general) in a state of flux for ten years since leaving my childhood religion, I never truly articulated this clearly. I knew I had a tendency not to commit and was uncertain about a lot of things since leaving the church, but I wasn't aware that all of these uncertainty was caused by separating myself from my Old Self. I was in an interstitial identity blackhole but I didn't know I am in one. To make matters worse, I completely avoided thinking about my past life as a Jehovah's Witness. I avoided it even when writing in my journals. For me, it was a dark past that needs to be completely burried. By enacting my psycho-socio-religious liminality through daily walking, which culminated to the long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo, things began to change.\n\n## Walking Liminality\n\nMy desire to walk is a physical expression—a symptom—of liminality. Walking is performed liminality [cite]. One notices this in the writings of someone like Craig Mod who has connected his desire to walk Japan with his background as an adopted child and a foreigner in a country far from home.\n\n\u003eI am adopted. The sensation of unbelonging — the tenuousness of connection without blood — permeates the life of an adopted person, and so perhaps having lived that allows me to feel a kind of comfort in the distance of life here.[^2]\n\n\u003eAdopted, Japan based some twenty+ years, torn from a blue-collar shell east of Hartford. Drunkenly walked Tokyo at night in my teens and twenties, and now soberly walk the countryside of Japan in my thirties. Walks have come to define my days and years, are now a durable “platform.” Using them to deconstruct the human geography and history of Japan...[^3]\n\nCraig Mod's attraction to mobility also coincides with his attraction to material culture, specifically architecture, photography, and food [Cite Kissa by Kissa here]. As if abandoned by society, people in liminal states cling to the material world for refuge. After leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses, I have always felt called by nature, landscapes, and physical spaces. It was as if my subconscious was telling me, \"You don't belong to any social circle. Perhaps it is in the animate outdoors where you truly belong.\" For a long time I actually may have believed that.\n\nWalking in nature became a way for me to recuperate from the loss of friends and family members who will no longer associate with someone who has \"grown cold in faith.\" I walked because I was largerly unsure—unsure of where I was going in life and who I was as a person. And this uncertainty calls for it to be performed, embodied, and enacted. My appreciation to long walks, or short daily walks, reflected this need to express uncertainty through my body while at the same time hoping that perhaps through it, I could recreate myself.\n\nIf documentation through field notes and photography could capture our experience of liminality when looking at dereliction in geographic space, say, in derelict urban spaces (Al Shrbaji, 2020), then perhaps, documentation too can be used to capture liminality as expressed through the field notes and photos we take during a walk. Photography and written or audio notes capture  the memory of that specific moment in the threshold. I go back to the photographs I took during all the walks I have undertaken since leaving my childhood religion and I now see glimpses of what it means to be in limen. I didn't know it then when I took the photos, but there was a reason why I was attracted to abandoned buildings, decaying objects, and landscapes that evoke uncertainty and limbo.\n\n[Share three photographs here and caption each]\n\n\"Walking carries with it the possibility for the exploration of the liminal\" (Hickey et al., 2018). There is something with this simple tool of mobility that helps one traverse liminality. Two of the most critical features of walking is encounter and relationality. If we adopt Hickey et al.'s (2018) proposal that ethnographies should be \"deeply relational encounters\" (37), then walking has to be a quintessential ethnographic method. A model for how walking can be applied in ethnography may be extracted from the book *Street Corner Society*, where the ethnographer William Foot-Whyte walked with his participants. Foot-Whye, a pioneer of participant observation, noticed how the geographic space of the slum area he and his participants walked through, along with the meanings and cultural behaviors attached to specific parts of the area, dictated his research progress, i.e., the questions he could ask, the behaviors he could act out, and the identities he could or could not take hold.\n\nWhen walking, an ethnographer encounters two entities: the Other and the place where they are walking (Ingold \u0026 Vergunst, 2008). Before the walk, the ethnographer may have very little commonality with the Other. But as the walk happens and the ethnographer joins the Other in traversing place and experience, i.e., liminality, a commonality between the researcher and the researched emerges. This commonality lays the foundation for deeper connection and, therefore, more honest revelations. Through walking, ethnography becomes what it should always be: a \"shared knowing, generated in place, together\" (Hickey et al., 2018, p. 40). The knowledge that emerges out of this shared liminality facilitated by walking is characterized by ethnographers who have used walking methodologies as genuine, honest, new, and deeply relational.\n\nWe could point to several characteristics of walking that makes it a perfect ethnographic method. First, walking opens the space for informality and candor between the researcher and the researched. While walking, the researcher and the researched are allowed to be \"messy, uncertain, and multivoiced\" (Denzin \u0026 Lincoln, 2005, p. 26), something that is not always the case in formal armchair interviews. Second, because walks are informal, they allow moments of experimental encounter (Hickey et al., 2018). Last, and perhaps most importantly, walking facilitates a negotiation of identities, both of the researcher and the researched, as they traverse the inherently liminal nature of ethnographic research together (Hickey et al., 2018). Walking is a tool and metaphor for ethnographic inquiry.\n\n## Walking as Autoethnography\n\nI argue that if walking not only figuratively explains the liminal nature of ethnographic research but also helps an ethnographer traverse this interstitial space, then the benefits of walking is easily transferrable to autoethnography. When applied to an autoethnographic encounter of someone in a psycho-socio-religious liminal state, as I am, walking generates a moment from within that liminal state through a \"physiologically mediated propulsion of the body and socially performed action\" (Hickey et al., 2018, p. 48) and transforms it into a shared encounter between the Old Self and the New Self Becoming. The idea that the Old Self and the New Self Becoming are sharing this moment in the threshold becomes the very foundation from where more honest reflection could emerge.\n\nIn autoethnography, the researcher is also the participant. You (the ethnographer) researches yourself (the participant) whose experiences and entire life reflect your identity, anchored on a social group [cite]. Autoethnography proposes that by digging into your autobiography, you induce conclusions that could represent what occurs within your social group[cite]. But what if, like I am, you are in a psycho-socio-religious liminal state, where your identity and social group is undefined and in flux? I argue that in this circumstance, walking, through its very nature as a physiological, social, and emplaced act, unveils the liminal space and the distance that exists between the former identity (the Old Self) and the new identity (the New Self Becoming).\n\nThis is exactly what happened to me on that elevated stretch after leaving Calauan—a geographic threshold between Los Baños and San Pablo. Of the many perplexing questions that that walk provoked, one that stood out was the question of what exactly triggered me to question my motivations for walking. Why did I suddenly asked why I was walking? In hindsight, it was the very nature of walking—the informality, the freedom, the physicality, and the embodied nature of the experience—that broke all hell lose and made me finally confront my Old Self. Through this embodied means of transportation, a correspondence between two entities, the researcher and the researched, within me was opened.\n\nThus, walking not only unveils the liminal space between the Old Self and the New Self but also provides a means to traverse it. Amid a psycho-socio-religious liminal state, an autoethnographer opens the possibility for the New Self Becoming to finally confront the Old Self and talk. Before the long walk to San Pablo, I avoided revisiting my past as a Jehovah's Witness. I used to think of those first 20 years of my life as a dark, wasted time, with nothing to contribute to where I am now, other than as a reference point to who I should not become. However, after the walk, my journal entries started to suggest that I was interested in inquiring about how my past could inform what I am currently doing. In my journal, I began comparing my life now and my life before and was surprised to realize that there were several elements of my old religious life that were actually better than what I have now. Back then I was embedded in community. Back then I was working hands-on with a historically marginalized community (the Deaf). Back then I immediately saw that my work made a difference in other people's lives. These are things I don't have right now, but want to have again. Although I will never achieve the level of clarity I had about who I was and what I want to do, I now see that there are elements in my former life that I want to reintegrate into my current life.\n\nEven more interestingly, my writings began talking about how my Old Self as a religious person still manifests in what I currently do. I started entertaining the idea that perhaps, even if I categorize myself as an agnostic, the work I am doing still has religious elements. In my journal entry on August 29, 2022, more than two months after the long walk to San Pablo, I wrote:\n\n\u003eToday, I will be trying to understand whether what I am doing is indeed religious. Obviously, it is philosophical and like Bugbee I don't have to articulate it and call it \"religion\" or even associate myself with the field of religion or religious studies. All I need to know is whether I could find inspiration from this field that I have been practically avoiding since 2012.\n\nWalking daily is a religious thing. And the great walkers I read, Henry David Thoreau and Henry Bugbee, all have works that can be described as religious [cite Gabriel Marcel's preface to the Inward Morning]. I want to clarify here that I am using the word religious in its generous liberal sense, which is a commitment to a way of living based on principles regardless of where those principles come from. In my Old Self, I heavily relied on an organization to dictate those principles; in my New Self Becoming, I rely on myself to set my own principles. But both new and old identities share a common desire to be religious, and I will never have realized this have I not walked from Los Baños to San Pablo.\n\nBut what happened there on the walk? What made me talk to the Old Self that I have resisted, ignored, and intentionally distanced from for years? Ingold (2015) said that walking creates a space for correspondence for everyone participating in the research. In my case, the Old Self and New Self Becoming. Walking does this by \"opening an opportunity for more irreverent, open and experimental dialogue\" (Hickey et al., 2018). Under a scorching sun, with only an umbrella to protect myself, forgetting to put sunscreen or bring sunglasses,  and burdened by the excessive luggage behind my back, what room is there for reverent dialogue? The physicality of walking prompted my New Self Becoming to loosen its guard, to shatter the walls it built around itself, and to finally confront through \"irreverent, open and experimental dialogue\" that which was always its subject of reseach, but unconcsiously disregarded: my Old Self.\n\nWhile walking, my New Self Becoming dropped from the tower it thought it always occupied to join my Old Self below as both researcher and participant. By doing so, my New Self Becoming understood my Old Self better, finally confronting it as a worthy subject of study. And what a productive move this was, because my Old Self held knowledge of the terrain that my New Self Becoming does not have. Even more frightening was the realization that perhaps the New Self Becoming has not yet moved that far away from my Old Self, that this new identity that thought it was new was actually, still very old, that what I was trying to metaphorically walk through was not an expanse but in fact an interstice.\n\nBut this is what walking does to the autoethnographer on the threshold of identities. It reveals commonalities between past and present identities and works as a form of transportation to help the autoethnographer traverse the “inbetween realm, which forms a third place, or threshold, that links as it separates two previously opposed conditions” (Coleman, 2005, p. 202). Walking allows one to relax and trust. Conversation with oneself is more natural compared to say journaling in a desk, natural breaks are allowed, and visual cues in the environment become prompts for reflection.\n\nOne afternoon, while walking, I noticed a long line of flowers with two colors. At first, I thought they grew from different plants: one flower being a variant of the other. Upon closer inspection, I was surprised to learn that the flowers, although different in color, grow from the same plant. I would later learn that these were Umbrellaworts or more commonly known as Four O'clocks, whose flowers open around the time of my afternoon walks, thus seeing them. This visual drama triggered thoughts on community. One of the things I lost after leaving my childhood religion was community. As a JW, I interacted with individuals who believed the same things I believe in on almost a daily basis. This was lost after I left. I tried hard even until now to find community and accepting that being in a liminal space such as where I am right now means coming at peace to the fact that I won't be connected to people I share similar beliefs with as easily as before and that differences and learning to navigate differences shall now be my norm. Walking and noticing umbrellaworts and how two flowers of different colors could grow from the same plant made me ask whether it is possible to grow community despite differences.\n\n[Discuss integration]\n\n\n\n## Perpetual Liminality\n\nAs Derrida (1967) suggested, \"deconstruction implies the possibility of rebuilding\" (p. xlix).\n\nPer Sartre (1946), existentialism and abandonment is related. An abandoned individual may have been abandoned by someone or has initiated the abandonment itself. Whatever the cause, abandonment involves detachment, a liminal condition, and it could be interpreted as \"autonomy of existence.\" Because no one is telling me what I need to do with my life, I have comlete freedom to shape who I want to be and how I want to exist.\n\n## Works Cited\n\nDahistrom, D.

On walking in derelict urban spaces: Experiencing liminality in a city. _A Obra Nasce: Revista de Arquitetura e Urbanismo Da Universidade Fernando Pessoa_, _14_, 73–83.\n\nArchitecture\n\n\u003eVan Eyck ... stated an attempt to reunite spatial and temporal polarities, to evoke a sense of place.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe liminal setting is described as an adjoining of worlds during a transition – always in motion – of an individual into, out of, or around a geometrical parameter.\n\u003e\n\u003ewhen the term liminality entered architecture in the 1950 ́s, it was translated in geometrical figures, the circle and the rectangle, to express a liminal setting of human transience.\n\nDereliction\n\n\u003edereliction is an outcome of these in-between occurrences, namely its life and death intervals.\n\u003e\n\u003eDereliction, thereto, expresses both a state of abandonment and a state of ruination; meaning, its environment is in-between the aforementioned states. There is where a liminal structure takes place.\n\u003e\n\u003edereliction is a liminal state, where its envi- ronment is evoked as a liminal space.\n\u003e\n\u003eTerms such as abandonment, ruination, and dereliction exemplify a pres- ence with liminality, as a gradually dispersing phenome- non into the progressive placidity\n\nExistentialism\n\n\u003eJean-Paul Sartre coined existentialism and related it to abandonment in his writing “Existentialism is a Humanism” in 1946. Abandonment is not a descriptive thought about a condition of something but of some being. Because Sartre was the first existentialist to separate existentialism from religion, abandonment, as being liminal, was a result of this detachment (abandonment as an autonomy of existence).\n\nLiminality\n\n\u003eLiminality, as a term, was coined in a dismantled timeline during the 20th century, by an ethnographer (Arnold van Gennep), an architect (Aldo van Eyck), and a cultural anthropologist (Victor Turner). All of whom described liminality as being a state of in-betweenness.\n\n\u003eliminality contains polysemic and polyvalent effects, meaning it shape-shifts according to its referral, it became a non-structural structuralist term.\n\n\u003ethe neologism of liminality came with the ethnographer Arnold van Gennep’s “Les Rites de Passage” (1908)\n\u003e\n\u003eVan Gennep drew the attention to liminality, as a new abbreviated form of an individual ́s deliberate and voluntary transition into a disoriented, intermediate state – through time amidst a ritual. This transitioning is rendered in a three-fold sequential structure. The structure synthesizes a three-phased order of rites, into which an individual – from any existing culture – transcends. From the liminal (transition) and what comes prior and after transcending into it, to a context, to a city, and then to a border, the order of phases emphasizes an in-betweenness performed within this procession.\n\n\u003eVictor Turner, a cultural anthropologist, on the other hand, reintroduced liminality into anthropology in his essay, “Liminal to Liminoid, in Play, Flow, and Ritual” (1974). Turner stressed on the semantic part, which engages with the psychological state and behaviour of an individual, during the transitional phase. By that, he relatively suggests the existence of an anti-structure, which circles back to the non-structural- ity of liminality, making both terms alternatively associated.\n\u003e\n\u003eliminality embodies a system that could be adequately linked to dissimilar, cohesive or conflicted, sources – ideas, meanings, movements, aspects, or systems.\n\u003e\n\u003e“inbetween realm, which forms a third place, or threshold, that links as it separates two previously opposed condi- tions.” (Coleman, 2005, p.202)\n\nIf liminality as portrayed in derelict urban spaces affects mobility in walking, I argue that liminality as experienced by an individual going through an important psychosocial transition, as in religious liminality, should also affect how one walks (or whether one walks at all) in space and time, which in turn, affects how one experiences, perceives, and eventually reinterprets one's liminal state. When a person in a psychosocial liminal state walks, liminality immediately becomes omnipresent: it exists both in here and out there. The walker traverses both existential and geographic wildernesses.\n\nWhat comes out of this circular dance between psychosocial liminality and walking in space and time is the New Self Becoming. Interestingly, the circle is a geometric shape that seems to best capture liminality in architecture.\n\n\u003eLimen, latin for threshold, is present in the limits of space and time. Meaning, through liminality, our movement is recorded, where it is a remainder of both space and time. Consequentially, liminality affects mobility, the stimulator of walking.\n\u003e\n\u003e“Having attributes of liminality or of liminal personae (“threshold people”)” (Turner, 1966, p.95), we become in-between a setting, in- between a texture, in-between a within and without, and in-between a reflection inside and outside the derelict. By that sense, the omnipresence of liminality is part of this existentiality.\n\nThe limen is always moving\n\n\u003ethe walking operation is part of the liminal transition. Meaning, it is always active, as we are relatively always traversing limits.\n\nPhotography\n\n\u003ethe use of the medium of photography is of a contiguity in expressing the relation between dereliction and liminality through our environmental experiences.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe documentation is associated to us, to our environmental experiences and to the derelict, as a correspondence to liminality, the term itself.\n\u003e\n\u003eliminality is the threshold and photography is an in-between captured memory within that threshold.\n\nWalking is an expression of liminality\n\n\u003eour walking is determined by the passage we take.\n\u003e\n\u003eWalking is defined “as a space of enunciation.” (Certeau, 1984, p.98) of a bodily activity.\n\u003e\n\u003ewalking thus becomes a rhetoric of liminality\n\nDeleuze, G., Guattari F., Massumi, B. (1987). 1730: Becoming- Intense, Becoming-Animal, Becoming- Imperceptible. In: A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia. University of Minnesota Press, pp. 232-309.\n\nBecomings are liminal\n\n\u003e“a becoming is always in the middle; one can only get it by the middle. A becoming is [..] the in-between, the border [..]” (Deleuze and Guat- tari, 1987, p. 293)\n\nGennep, A., Vizedom, M., and Caffee G. (1960). The Rites of Passage.

(2018). _On the edges of encounter: Walking, liminality and the act of being between_ (K. Snepvangers \u0026 S. Davis, Eds.; pp. 37–54). Common Ground Publishing. [https://doi.org/10.18848/978-1-86335-132-4/CGP](https://doi.org/10.18848/978-1-86335-132-4/CGP)\n\n## Definitions of walking\n\nWalking is \"both the physiologically mediated propulsion of the body and socially performed action occurring within closely defined realms of (acceptable) practice\" (Hickey et al., 2018, p. 48).\n\nWalking “is a profoundly social activity: that in their timings, rhythms and inflections, the feet respond as much as does the voice to the presence of others” (Ingold \u0026 Vergunst, 2008, p. 2).\n\n## Walking is a quintessential method for ethnography\n\nThe cognitive and sensorial nature of walking makes it a powerful ethnographic method (Ingold 2011, p. 17).\n\nWalking mobilizies \"all of our senses of smell and touch as well as vision” (Tim Ingold, 2011, p. 42).\n\nWalking is an embodied and \"deeply reflexive point of encounter\" (Hickey et al., 2018, p. 37).\n\nWalking provokes sensory, liminal, and uncertain encounters.\n\nWalking can be a localized and evolving methodology.\n\n\u003ewalking stands as an exemplary technique of ethnographic inquiry and that through the opportunity walking offers as an “embodied practice, performative act, as well as relational movement” (Yi’En, 2014, p. 212) the core features of ethnography are found.\n\nWalking makes ethnography an engaged methodology where movement is central.\n\n\u003eThe movement of walking provides the ‘stuff’ of the inquiry by opening new terrains for exploration, and a chance for new modes of engagement between researcher and researched to emerge.\n\n\u003ewalking is in fact ethnography in action\n\n\u003eWalking certainly did afford a specific insight into a set of experiences that became, by their nature, necessarily peripatetic.\n\n## Walking together results to parrhessia (speaking openly)\n\n\u003ewalking offers the possibility for new forms of knowledge. Walking allows for the traversing of interstitial spaces; spaces between fixed points of meaning where conventions and established ways of doing things might be challenged and subverted even if only momentarily. This is an important consideration for walking as method. The affordance walking offers finds voice in the (potential) irreverence the walk enables. Walking between places offers the opportunity for parhessia (of speaking openly), freed from the strictures that those places at each end of the walk prescribe.\n\n\u003eit is with the irreverence and possibility for speaking openly, or more fully, that an affordance for deeper knowing emerges.\n\n\u003ethrough traversing the interstitial spaces that are opened between points of fixed meaning and moving across the terrain of the field and the terrain of experience between Self and Other, that an opportunity for something ethnographically more genuine, spontaneous and experimental emerges.\n\n\u003ewalking enables rich and meaningful accounts of experience to emerge.\n\n## Walking launches the researcher and the researched into a shared liminality that becomes the foundation for genuine connection\n\nWhen walking, an ethnographer encounters two entities: the Other and the place where they are walking (Ingold \u0026 Vergunst, 2008. Before the walk, the ethnographer may have very little commonality with the Other. But as the work happens and the ethnographer joins the Other in encountering the place and each other in traversing place and experience, i.e., liminality, a commonality between the researcher and the researched emerges, a commonality that lays the foundation for deeper connection and, therefore, more honest revelations. Through walking, ethnography becomes what it should always be: a \"shared knowing, generated in place, together\" (Hickey et al., 2018, p. 40). The knowledge that emerges out of this shared liminality facilitated by walking is characterized by ethnographers who have used walking methodologies as genuine, honest, new, and deeply relational.\n\n==When applied to an autoethnographic encounter of someone in a psycho-socio-religious liminal state, what walking does is to generate a temporal segment through movement from within that liminal state and transforms that segment into a shared encounter between the Old Self and the New Self Becoming. The idea that the old You and the new You is sharing this moment in the threshold becomes the foundation for more honest reflection.\n\n## Walking is a liminal practice that creates a better ethnographic practice\n\n\u003ewalking carries with it the possibility for the exploration of the liminal.\n\n\u003ewalking as an act of being positioned at the threshold.\n\n\u003eLiminality is activated through walking, of entering and progressing through a space of movement and uncertainty.\n\n\u003eWalking as liminal practice opens access to spaces prone to disruption and uncertainty, but from which might emerge a “topology for new tasks toward other places of thinking and putting to work, innovations leading to new forms” (Lather, 1997, p. 486). In walking together, the researcher and researched undertake a shared act of becoming, but importantly do so according to reformulations of the practices that mark more traditional, linear research practices. In a walking method, dialogue is framed as co-created; a discovery of new terrains that emerge from the encounter. This is a research practice that opens access to the terrain of the Other according to the encounters and opportunities for dialogue that walking-with provokes.\n\n\u003eThe traversal of space afforded by walking is also metaphorical, in that it provides insight into the experience of Self and Other. In traversing the physical, the liminal spaces of experience in between Self and Other are also encountered.\n\n\u003ewalking offered a chance to engage the experience of the Other through the dialogues that were broached through walking.\n\n## Ethnography is liminal in nature\n\n\u003eEthnography in this sense is the practice of moving from the familiar to engage the lifeworld of the Other; a process of becoming invested with the unfamiliar. To emerge with some resolution (however incomplete) of the experience of the Other stands as the very purpose of the ethnographic endeavour.\n\n## Walking makes a liminal space a fruitful source of knowledge\n\n\u003eWith walking comes the possibility to more readily traverse, physically, symbolically and metaphorically the space and the experience of the Other. The interstitial locations between points of familiarity that walking provokes opens the liminal as a fruitful place for inquiry and shared understanding. In this regard we see the act of walking as a provocation for more than the physical traversal of space alone;\n\n\u003ecross boundaries and to ensure that the ‘space between’ functions as a productive environment of new knowledge and a space of new understandings.\n\n## The two most critical features of walking\n\nTwo of the most critical features of walking is encounter and relationality. If we adopt Hickey et al.'s (2018) proposal that ethnographies should be \"deeply relational encounters\" (37), then walking has to be a quintessential ethnographic method.\n\n## William Foot-Whyte and Street Corner Society\n\nA model for how walking can be applied in ethnography may be extracted from the book *Street Corner Society*, where the ethnographer William Foot-Whyte walked with his participants. Foot-Whye, a pioneer of participant observation, noticed how the geographic space of the slum area he and his participants walked through, along with the meanings and cultural behaviors attached to specific parts of the area, dictated his research progress, i.e., the questions he could ask, the behaviors he could act out, and the identities he could or could not take hold.\n\n\u003eThe act of walking opened opportunities for encounters that otherwise would not have been possible\n\n\u003ewalking as that which is quintessentially in-between, a space of disruption and uncertainty, but from which might emerge a “topology for new tasks toward other places of thinking and putting to work” (Lather, 1997, p. 486).\n\n\u003ewalking opened an opportunity for informality and experimentation.\n\n## Walking as subject of inquiry (ethnography of walking)\n\n\u003ean ethnography of walking would perceive the act of walking within its socially mediated contexts, and explore how walking as an action is performed, how the meanings that attach with this are symbolically and culturally mediated and indeed, how the physical performativity that marks the very act itself comes to gain social meaning.\n\n\u003eopen for consideration the significance of walking as a necessarily social practice\n\n\u003envests attention solely in the practice of walking as a socially mediated practice.\n\n## Walking as ethnography or ambulatory inquiry\n\n\u003ethe walking ethnographer takes the encounters from walking as the object of study with the interactions these encounters afford standing as the stuff of the ethnographic inquiry. Not only would this open for consideration the experiences of walking itself (as a socially mediated act), but also the methodological dynamics that are induced through ambulatory inquiry.\n\n\u003ewalking functions as a method for inquiring into the world and the experience that being situated (on foot) in-place and in-proximity to Others prescribes.\n\n## Walking transforms the identities of both researcher and researched\n\n\u003eJust as the researcher undertakes their work in the liminal space of the field, so too do the identities of both the researcher and researched find meaning according to the act of traversing the distance between.\n\u003e\n\u003ewalking functioned as concomitant to the discovery of the Self, with the walks provoking encounters with the Self just as much as they provoked encounters with Others and space.\n\n---\n\n**Walking unveils the liminal space and the distance between Old Self and New Self.**\n\nThis is exactly what happened to me while walking from Los Baños to San Pablo. What is interesting to me is that \n\n**Walking provides a means to cross this liminal space between Old Self and New Self.**\n\nThis means is an easy means. It makes the self relaxed and trust. Visual cues in the environment become prompts for reflection. Conversation with oneself is more natural compared to say journaling in a desk. Natural breaks are allowed.\n\nHow do visual cues help traverse liminal spaces?\n\nCite example of a friend I met online, which I wrote at Lilim 1(02).\n\nOne of the things I lost after leaving my childhood religion was community. As a JW, I interacted with individuals who believed the same things I believe in on almost a daily basis. This was lost after I left. I tried hard even until now to find community and accepting that being in a liminal space such as where I am right now means coming at peace to the fact that I won't be connected to people I share similar beliefs with as easily as before and that differences and learning to navigate differences shall now be my norm. Walking and noticing umbrellaworts and how two flowers of different colors could grow from the same plant made me ask whether it is possible to grow community despite differences.\n\n**As the New Self Becoming traverses the liminal space between Old Self and New Self, the identities of the researcher (the New Self Becoming) and the researched (Old Self) are transformed.**\n\nTransformation happens through the writing of new narratives and the creation of new meanings. This exercise is possible in liminal spaces because there are too much unknowns open for questioning, review, and reinterpretation. Traversing these liminal spaces through physical mobility provides the possibility for embodied inquiry.\n\n**Walking becomes the common progression (and procession) that unites Old Self and the New Self Becoming.**\n\nAfter my long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo, my writings began talking about how my Old Self as a religious person still manifests in what I currently do and perhaps even if I categorize myself as an agnostic, the work I am doing is still very religious. Walking daily is a religious thing. And the great walkers I read, Thoreau and Bugbee, all have works that can be described as religious.\n\nI want to clarify here that I am using the word religious in its generous liberal sense, which is a commitment to a way of living based on principles regardless of where those principles come from. In my case, in my New Self Becoming, unlike my Old Self that relied on an organization, I set my own principles. But both new and old identities are united by this desire to be religious, and I will never have realized this have I not walked from Los Baños to San Pablo.\n\nBut what happened there on the walk? What made me talk to the Old Self that I have resisted, ignored, and intentionally distanced from for years? Ingold (2015) said that walking creates a space for correspondence for everyone participating in the research. In my case, the Old Self and New Self Becoming. Walking does this by \"opening an opportunity for more irreverent, open and experimental dialogue\" (Hickey et al., 2018). Under a scorching sun, with only an umbrella to protect myself, forgetting to put sunscreen or bring sunglasses,  and burdened by the excessive luggage behind my back, what room is there for reverent dialogue? The physicality of walking prompted my New Self Becoming to loosen its guard, to shatter the walls it built around itself, and to finally confront through \"irreverent, open and experimental dialogue\" that which was always its subject of reseach, but unconcsiously disregarded: my Old Self.\n\nWhile walking, my New Self Becoming dropped from the tower it thought it always occupied to join my Old Self below as both researcher and participant. By doing so, my New Self Becoming understood my Old Self better, finally confronting it as a worthy subject of study. And what a productive move this was, because my Old Self held knowledge of the terrain that my New Self Becoming does not have. Even more frightening was the realization that perhaps the New Self Becoming has not yet moved that far away from my Old Self, that this new identity that thougt it was new was actually, still very old, that what I was trying to metaphorically walk through was not an expanse but in fact an interstice.\n\n**Walking performs the New Self Becoming that has integrated the Old Self.**\n\nSolnit, R. (2005). A Field Guide to Getting Lost. Peguin Books.\n\n\u003e“getting lost was not a matter of geography so much as identity, a passionate desire, even an urgent need, to become no one and anyone, to shake off the shackles that remind you who you are, who others think you are.” (Solnit, 2005, p. 11)\n\nStenner, P. (2017). _Liminality and experience: a transdisciplinary approach to the psychosocial._ Studies in the Psychosocial (STIP). London: Palgrave Macmillan.\n\n\u003eThis book breathes new life into the study of liminal experiences of transition and transformation, or ‘becoming’. It brings fresh insight into affect and emotion, dream and imagination, and fabulation and symbolism by tracing their relation to experiences of liminality. The author proposes a distinctive theory of the relationship between psychology and the social sciences with much to share with the arts. Its premise is that psychosocial existence is not made of ‘stuff’ like building blocks, but of happenings and events in which the many elements that compose our lives are temporarily drawn together. The social is not a thing but a flow of processes, and our personal subjectivity is part of that flow, ‘selves’ being tightly interwoven with ‘others’. But there are breaks and ruptures in the flow, and during these liminal occasions our experience unravels and is rewoven. This book puts such moments at the core of the psychosocial research agenda. Of transdisciplinary scope, it will appeal beyond psychosocial studies and social psychology to all scholars interested in the interface between experience and social (dis)order.\n\nLiminality is peformed\n\n\u003ethe experience is a subjective functioning that one contrives in order to become performative.\n\u003e\n\u003eliminality induces a rupture between reality and fiction. The arise of this split is another nature of liminality—always articulated with an individual perspective—heading to reflect its environment. The liminal process is dedicated, in an attempt, to express the spatial and temporal poetics, or experiences.\n\u003e\n\u003e“liminal occasions tend to be highly affective in nature because they are formative moments of great significance: leaps into the unknown,” (Stenner, 2017, p. 16) they provoke experiences.\n\nTurner, V. (1966). Liminality and Communatis. In: The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti Structure. Cornell University Press, pp. 94-130.\n\n\u003e“liminal entities are neither here nor there...” (Turner, 1966, p. 94)\n\u003e\n\u003e“liminality is frequently likened to death, to being in the womb, to invisibility, to darkness...to the wilderness...” (Turner, 1966, p. 95)\n\nTurner, V. (1987). “Betwixt and Between: The Liminal Period in Rites of Passage”. In Mahdi, I.C., Foster, S. \u0026 Little, M. (eds.) _Betwixt and Between: Patterns of and Feminine Initiation_. Open Court.\n\n\u003eall rites of transition are marked by three phases: separation, margin (or limen), and aggregation. The first phase of separation comprises symbolic behaviour signifying the detachment of the individual or group either from an earlier fixed point in the social structure or a set of cultural conditions during the intervening liminal period, the state of the ritual subject is ambiguous; he [sic] passes through a realm that has few or none of the attributes of the past or coming state; in the third phase the passage is consummated (Turner, 1987, p. 47).",

    "title": "Etymology of the word lilim",
    "content": "\n_Lilim_ is a Tagalog word that, with weird serendipity, captures everything I look forward to in a walk or a bicycle ride outdoors.\n\n_Lilim_ means shade made by any structure that blocks light from above. Usually, it refers to a shade that a tree makes, blocking sunlight, particularly on a very hot summer day.\n\nIn a country like the Philippines, a _lilim_ is a friend of nature lovers. For some, it is the only reason why a walk outdoors is even attractive. Aside from the infrequent dry and cold weather days in the Philippines, which makes a shade-less walk possible, most communion with nature would be done under extreme heat from the sun from as early as nine in the morning to as late as five in the afternoon. To go out and walk in nature with a portable _lilim_, an umbrella, is acceptable but weird. People who walk here are able to do it because of a _lilim_, which is sometimes the canopy of tall trees that cover a forested path. In less forested paths, such as those in the middle of fields I used to walk on in Pangasinan, a _lilim_ is less available, but its sight is welcomed and anticipated.\n\nI envy Thoreau for going out as early as after lunch to go for a walk that would end sometimes until eight in the evening. I am less dedicated to walking I guess—partly because I need to contend with digital distractions than Thoreau didn’t and partly because I need to wait for more shade, for more lilim. Thoreau was simply living in a colder place in the world, where the heat from the sun is more tolerable for long, reflective walks.\n\nHere in the Philippines, by four or five in the afternoon, the sun is less hot as it has begun its descent. This is often the time I go out to walk or ride my bike to discover a new path, visit an old one, and just find something new to see. Interestingly, while researching more about the word _lilim_, I discovered that its Pangasinan equivalent, _sirom_, is a synonym of the Tagalog word _dapithapon_ or sunset. _Sirom_ is also a Hiligaynon and Waray word, which means the same thing. Therefore, _lilim_ is not just the shade of trees that I have taken refuge on during many of my walks and bike rides. _Lilim_ is also the time when I took those walks—a time when I would often be alone in the middle of fields as farmers go home after a long day of work.\n\nAt that time, clouds are also more mature, much bigger, creating welcomed shades that block the sun—a phenomenon called by the similarly sounding Tagalog word _lilom_. The best _lilom_ would create beautiful sceneries in the sky: celestial halos, long sun rays, and the much-awaited mackerel sky.\n\nHowever, even the best lilom will not replace a good shade from an old tree—the perfect _lilim_.\n\nA _lilim_ is where I am allowed to slow down, shift my walk from the dirt road towards the inner paths of my soul. It is where rest is possible, where stillness happens. It is where one’s immediate natural surroundings and one’s intimate thoughts, feelings, and insights begin to converge into a single state of being. It is where one can start to answer life’s deepest questions—Why are we here? Where are we going? What does this all mean?—all within the comfortable, existential caress that nature provides.\n\n## References\n\n[[Lilim 1 - Lilim A Weekly Newsletter on Philosophy, Art, and the Outdoors]]",

    "content": "\nToday, [[Religion is commonly used as a social genus]]. However, the word religion did not originally refer to a group. [[The concept of religion originally applied to individuals]]. The concept shifted from an individual to a group context through a historical process that took many years.\n\nEven in ancient times, people were aware that other groups of people worshipped other gods and had practices related to that worship, seeing them as rivals. In this context, the word religio was used with nobis. Nobis religio meant \"our way to worship.\" This is the closest use of the word *religio* in relation with a group in ancient times. Christians would later use the word *religio* to explicitly refer to a group of people following specific rules. They used *religio* (*religiones* plural) to refer to a monastic order.\n\nThe fact that *religio* was used in both divine and human contexts was the reason why Augustine rejected the word *religio* to refer to \"how one worships God.\" As centuries passed by, the meaning of the word religion has been incoherent and [[The incoherence of the word religion questions its essence and realness]].\n\n# References\n\nSchilbrack, K.

In that context, one sometimes sees the use of nobis religio to mean “our way of worship”.\n\u003e \n\u003e Nevertheless, religio had a range of senses and so Augustine could consider but reject it as the right abstract term for “how one worships God” because the Latin term (like the Latin terms for “cult” and “service”) was used for the observance of duties in both one’s divine and one’s human relationships\n\u003e \n\u003e In the Middle Ages, as Christians developed monastic orders in which one took vows to live under a specific rule, they called such an order religio (and religiones for the plural)",

    "title": "Experience machine",
    "content": "\nThe experience machine is a thought experiment first introduced by [[Robert Nozick]].\n\nNozick describes it as a tank of water with electrodes in it. When a human connects to these electrodes, they generate any experience the human desires from it. It has a large library of various experiences that a user can choose from. A user can plug into it and select life experiences for the next two years. While plugged in, the user won’t know that they are plugged in.\n\nWe can program the machine to become a hedonistic machine (i.e., a machine that produces only happy experiences). The question that Nozick asks about the machine is: “Will you plug? What else can matter to us, other than how our lives feel from the inside?”\n\nUsing the experience machine as a thought experiment, Nozick argues that [[Happiness is not the ultimate value]].\n\nThe argumentation that led to this conclusion are as follows:\n\nP1: If experiencing as much pleasure as we can is all that matters to us, then if we will experience more pleasure by doing x than by doing y, we have no reason to do y rather than x.\n\nP2: We will experience more pleasure if we plug into the experience machine than if we do not plug into the experience machine.\n\nC1: If all that matters to us is that we experience as much pleasure as we can, then we have no reason not to plug into the experience machine. (P1\u0026P2)\n\nP3: We have reason not to plug into the experience machine.\n\nC2: Experiencing as much pleasure as we can is not all that matters to us. (C1\u0026P3, by MT)\n\nJoshua Greene and Felipe de Brigard’s version of the experiment offers a criticism to this conclusion by suggesting that the reason why we don’t plug into the machine is not because something is more important to us than happiness, but because it breaks the status quo (i.e., [[Status quo bias]]).\n\n# References\n\nNozick, R.

  "/Feeling-Empty-After-Finishing-A-Big-Project": {
    "title": "Feeling Empty After Finishing A Big Project",
    "content": "![Plant behind lights](Plant-behind-lights.jpg)\n\nI parked my bike under the shade of a small stout tree. It looks small from where I am standing because I am elevated around three or four feet from its roots. I am standing on concrete. This path has been cemented in the past year or so and this tree is one of the few lucky ones to avoid the teeth of the chainsaw. I am grateful for it for I was yet to attach the stand on my bike. I rested my bike on its rough trunk.\n\nIt's 6:30 pm. Everything was already dark. The days have been shorter and the evenings longer. I have to readjust my afternoon rides if I want to catch the sunset—a feat I find so difficult to do. I have gotten so used to going out at 6 pm that I’ve forgotten it is no longer March.\n\nI looked at the large lights from afar. They are lights on the highway across this vast field of dark green. Smaller lights moved below these larger lights—one after the other like bowling balls.\n\nA feeling started to seep in while I saw all of these—the feeling that I’ve had since this morning and which I tried to escape from. It is the feeling that I am “still” lacking something—a feeling of failed expectations.\n\n## Familiar Doldrums\n\nToday marks the end of several months of trying to construct a [[thoughts/life management system]]—an integrated productivity, knowledge management, and total life system. It has been a fulfilling, revealing, and exciting project to build. It’s much needed too because for so long I have been unable to organize my life in a way that totally made sense to me. Being someone who admires and “needs” organization, not being able to do this meant years of procrastination and psychological stress. I was able to address this mental burden in the past three months or so and I have a functioning minimum viable life system to show for it.\n\nI know that it is already achieving what it was built to do because I am feeling less anxious about it. I am ready to move on for the next project.\n\nBut then, I was surprised to find myself in these familiar doldrums at the end of large pursuits. I first experienced the doldrums after launching -_Tanaw_, the free ebook I created by compiling the answers of several awesome people on three questions that I was pondering on. I expected a feeling of jubilation, of joy, of rupture at the end of the project, only to find myself in a place of bland emptiness. This feeling always left me doubting myself and my efforts. It makes me feel like I wasted all my time doing something that wasn’t giving me the happiness I expected it to provide. I know that swimming and diving into this feeling would leave me afraid of pursuing new projects that may also fail to make me happy, so I try to avoid this feeling, to escape it, and to move on.\n\nBut the feeling won’t go. And I have grown old enough to know that feelings like these won’t go unless they’re confronted head on.\n\n## What Truly Makes Us Happy\n\nLooking at the large and small lights from afar made me realize (or, more accurately, made me remember the lesson I learned months ago from Laurie Santos’ enlightening course [“The Science of Well-being.\"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being)\n\nThe things we think will make us happy are not the “direct” paths to happiness. Usually, they are simply scaffoldings that allow happiness to possibly emerge. But by themselves, they will not generate the feelings we are asking them to generate.\n\nI felt empty because I was looking for a quick fix to all my emotional hurdles (many of which were worsened by the pandemic). I completely forgot that happiness is so fleeting that it needs to be revisited constantly, generated not by big projects but by small actions and habits.\n\nWhat are these habits?\n\nHere’s a wallpaper created and shared by a [fellow student](https://www.facebook.com/groups/happinesslab) of the course listing the habits that generate happiness. It is the wallpaper I use for my phone.\n\n![Happiness habits wallpaper](happiness-habits.jpeg)\n\n- **Exercising, eating, and sleeping well.** Food, being physical, has a direct influence on our mental states. This is the reason why eating certain foods can make us feel groggy while eating others make our minds sharper. Likewise, exercising and sleeping enough a day have direct effects on our mental well-being. This is so obvious but we don’t always make these three things our priority.\n- **Taking time.** Our society has glorified material affluence when what really makes us happy, according to science, is time affluence. Material affluence should allow us to have more time because this is what matters more—the freedom to do what we want to do when we want to do it or the freedom of just not doing anything at all! Being too busy is not always good for us.\n- **Being grateful.** Gratitude has an immense influence on our general well-being, so immense that even writing a gratitude letter to someone you love and reading that aloud in front of him/her in person could raise your well-being by a large margin for more than a month!\n- **Meditating.** Meditation is something that a lot of people are unwilling to do. Two reasons prevent them from exploring this powerful tool: it is difficult and it is frequently associated with Eastern religious beliefs. Fortunately, one can benefit from meditation without having to light an incense or sing chants. It is also not as difficult to do as some teachers describe it. Even reconnecting with one’s breath for a second can have massive effects on one’s internal state. I have so much to say about this but will leave it for a future post.\n- **Connecting.** Connecting with loved ones and striking up conversations with strangers have a direct impact on our happiness, according to science. Granted, it is not easy to take care of this area of our life (or at least, for introverts like me, it isn’t easy). But taking care of our social connections especially during this time of social distancing is critical in preventing depression and other mental health problems. If you are a natural connector, you have a duty to build spaces where people can connect during these difficult times.\n- **Savoring.** Savoring correlates with meditating. Savoring is like bringing the spirit of meditation into every important moment of one’s life (if we are being truly honest, this means every single moment of our life!) Whether it’s looking longer on the leaves falling from a tree, eating slower to connect with every taste in our food, or making the most of the days we spend with the little children in our lives (who will soon be teenagers and adults!), savoring directly generates happiness.\n\nThe science shows that once these tiny actions are covered, a person should expect his or her well-being to drastically improve. But the linchpin is to turn these into habits—actions we repeat and revisit. The reason why we need to continuously do them is because of the very nature of positive mental states like happiness or flow. Like any emotion really, happiness is fleeting. It shows up then goes. We know it’s good for us so it has to be pursued but we need to make some effort. Fortunately, these habits are small and doable as compared to the big projects that we are expecting will make us happy (getting married, buying a new car, getting a raise, etc.)\n\n## The Right Goals\n\nWe don’t realize this often but there’s a big possibility that we are going after the wrong goals or maybe the goals we set for ourselves are good and worthy goals but we are expecting a lot from them or we are expecting the wrong things from them.\n\nBuilding a productivity system, I learned, produces a sense of control and calm. Building it is still a worthy pursuit. I will share my journey in building it at another time.\n\nHowever, building a life system doesn't make one happy at least in a way that one expects. It is still possible to build a life system and feel awful afterward (like what happened to me) because the feeling of being in control and hitting one task after another in an organized way is not a direct path to happiness. It helps construct a place where positive emotions can flourish. But, by itself, it does not necessarily enhance well-being.\n\nWhat enhances well-being are habits—the tiny little actions that we do and revisit regularly, which reconnect us with the mental states that we’re looking for. These actions are the content that fills up whatever life system we build for ourselves.\n\nNow that I have a minimum viable life system in place, it's time to make good use of it by pursuing the more important goals that directly translate to happiness.\n\nYesterday, I messaged my tribe asking them to set aside time twice a month for an accountability call. This regular meeting will definitely increase my well-being. It took me just five minutes to set something that I know will make me happy for the weeks to come. Compare that to the three or more months I spent fixing my system!\n\nRaising the level of our well-being, especially as we continue to tread through this pandemic that has been very, very long is the most critical project we should all engage in in the following months. It is what I choose to dedicate my time next. As always, I will write about my learnings and share them with you.\n\nThank you for always reading and I hope this has been useful.\n",

Therefore, to believe in freedom is to believe on the [[thoughts/self]] and to protect freedom is to protect the self. Knowing the self amplifies freedom.\n\nFreedom is doing things the way I want them to be. That’s why I work as a freelancer and why I gave myself the permission to not grow my blog into a business but instead into just a vehicle for self-expression and service. I don’t want my words to be hindered by the desire to please others or to gain more followers or to earn money. If there’s anything that hinders self-expression in my blog right now that is my desire to serve a soul, to write for a friend who is asking me a question rather than simply to write for myself. But at the same time, I find that, to use a line from a song by Foster the People:”It’s funny how freedom can make us feel contained.” Freedom gives us the rare chance to do things that we love when we like it in the way we want to do them. But it’s frightening when you suddenly realise there’s just so little you can do with the large amount of freedom you have. Many times I felt this in the past, thought that maybe I should just go back and find a full-time job so my days would be automatically filled with ready-made TO DOs.\n\n",

What makes you feel Ginhawa is not what makes me feel Ginhawa.\n\nIf I impose my own context on you, there’s a big chance that you will not feel Ginhawa not only because the prerequisites for your unique experience of Ginhawa are drastically different from mine but also because [[Being forced to do something hinders Ginhawa]] by itself. In order for you to feel Ginhawa, you need to be able to influence your own physical and mental states. You need freedom to do this. The more freedom you have, the more you can currate your context.

Ginhawa may appear in authoritarian contexts, but it will not be optimized. Furthermore, such experience of Ginhawa is not resilient because individuals change all the time, so the physical and mental states that produce Ginhawa for them changes too.

    "title": "Freelancing or Entrepreneurship is More Financially Secure Than a 9-5 Job",
    "content": "\nI just came from an event that Lea hosted, an event that exposed me, for the first time, to a new breed of freelancers. I am a freelancer myself—always was, always is—although I no longer call myself that.\n\nAfter finishing my studies in 2013, I decided to have a \"gap year\" to think about what I really wanted to do with my life. Why I needed that time for myself is a story for another time. But suffice to say, a traditional 9-5 job will not allow me to have that time and space to learn about myself better. So I decided to devote a big chunk of my first year out of college to introspection and personal development while teaching ESL to Japanese students in the evenings to support myself financially.\n\nI was part of that early to middle wave of Pinoy freelancers, who found work primarily through middle-men platforms like Rarejob, Essays.ph, UpWork, Fiverr, etc. These were platforms that treated freelancers like commodities, paying us with \"barya\" in exchange for promises of a more flexible schedule. We were practically paid laborers without benefits, but we didn't see this as a bane as much as the newer freelancers see it now, just because working at home on your pajamas was a pretty exciting opportunity in the early 2010s, especially for moms with newborns or lazy socially anxious people like me who didn't thrive in office politics.\n\nTimes have changed, for the better, for most of us freelancers, and meeting these new breed of freelancers a while ago reassured me of that. Although I was never really part of that change, I managed to flow with it, somehow, mostly by discovering what works for myself. I learned to look for higher paying gigs at foreign job boards instead of Upwork. These highly flexible and good paying projects allowed me to have as much time for myself as possible. Money was not really my goal. Time was what was really important to me. It still is. I wanted to develop my creative writing as much as possible and I am simply using freelancing to sustain that. I never really built a brand or platform or client base. I kinda played with it in the past but failed. And that was okay. Freelancing was not my calling anyway. It was simply a tool to support my real calling. I have succeeded! I now spend more time doing my \"real work\" and spend just enough days working per month. For now, this way of freelancing was enough. And that is what's amazing about freelancing! There is no one-size-fits-all way of doing it. You can enter it with your own unique goals and make it work for you. Sure there are best practices to make sure you continue to earn through it. But other than that, you find what works for you. That's what \"free\" means in freelancing. And that ability to design how you work in accordance with your preffered lifestyle, is something that is very, very difficult to find in traditional employment.\n\nThat said, one of the most popular criticisms to freelancing or entrepreneurship or working for yourself is that it is a less secure form of employment. By \"less secure\", critics mean it pays less and income is fluctuating (and, therefore, unreliable). Then they would add, you don't get \"benefits\" that 9-5 workers get.\n\n\"Wala kang patutunguhan diyan,\" I once heard a critic say to a fellow freelancer.\n\nThis criticism usually comes from those who know nothing about the business world, who never tried starting a business themselves, which already makes their criticisms highly questionable. That said, there is indeed some truth to their criticism. A good number of freelancers and entrepreneurs struggle and give up on their first year. But almost all of them were doing freelancing the wrong way! And this is my main point: done correctly and designed carefully, freelancing is way, way more secure than a 9-5 job.\n\nIf you have kept at the very least a part-time job and built an emergency fund while you are experimenting with freelancing on the side, if you have developed a skill or a set of skills that a specific group of people would pay a premium for, if you have set up systems to attract, convert, retain, and encourage referrals, if you have a strong support system of fellow freelancers, and if you have learned personal finance so your hard-earned money is not put to waste, you will be more secure—far more secure—than your 9-5 counterpart. I am confident of this.\n\nWhy? All because of one word: resilience.\n\nA well-trained freelancer is more resilient than a well-trained employee. An employee is usually only trained at one job and only knows how to do that job in a fixed setting. He also is conditioned to rely on a single source of income, which comes in a regular monthly rhythm. Because he spends 9-5 at work plus the commutes to work, most days he arrives at home tired with no time nor energy to learn new skills or start new sources of income.\n\nIf there is anything we learned about work from COVID, it is that we no longer live in a fixed environment. Nothing is already truly \"stable.\" The new world of work favors those with a wider spectrum of skills and who are very \"comfortable\" to change.\n\nNow consider the freelancer. The freelancer has to learn a lot of things to keep her business afloat and to serve her clients better. Most freelancers nowadays offer different skills which they bundle through different packages, and if those skills get obsolete, they are very comfortable learning new skills that they can profit from.\n\nAside from this, a freelancer is comfortable with fluctuating income. Yes, newbie freelancers are overwhelmed with this. It causes stress to them but rightfully so. Most of them are transitioning from traditional jobs that paid them on a regular time monthly. But pro freelancers know the importance of saving for an emergency fund which covers their expenses at times of income fluctuation. Most well-trained freelancers are very very comfortable in a recession or an unstable economy, like what we are currently having worldwide. The best freelancers do not rely on a single source of income, they establish several businesses which diversify their risks, and they are only able to start multiple businesses just because they have more time than their 9-5 counterparts.\n\nIn addition, the barriers to entry to freelancing are diminishing by the day. While you might need to get a degree or certificate or even license to work at 9-5 jobs, a lot of freelancers start their businesses just by self-directed learning, mostly through the Internet, which makes freelancing even more accessible. You don't need to pay tuition to be a freelancer. Some of the most successful freelancers I personally know are college dropouts.\n\nTheoretically, freelancing is a more resilient, lucrative, and potentially rewarding option even in a poor country like the Philippines, and the many success stories from this new breed of Pinoy freelancers are convincing me that it is practically better—way better than traditional forms of employment.\n\nI am very optimistic that freelancing will soon be adopted by industries and fields that don't use it right now in the country. For example, how can we make good use of the hundreds (perhaps, thousands?) of Pinoys with advanced degrees, especially academic degrees (masters and PhDs), who currently don't have jobs (because academia is notoriously bad at giving people jobs and having them keep them!)? I am excited for the day when \"freelance philosophers\" or \"consultant sociologists\" shall become lucrative career options in the Philippines.\n\nAnd all these fact-based optimism, which I share with many, is the reason why I just couldn't wrap my head around this antiquated idea that the ONLY way to be financially stable and secure is to get an in-demand degree at a leading university and then work as a 9-5 employee at a decent company until you are aged 60.\n\nThat narrative has already changed. It started to change when Pinoy freelancers refused being paid \"kakapirangot\" for their services and the pandemic has only accelerated that change. And if there's anything constant about what I am seeing among this new breed of Filipino freelancers, it is that they won't ever stop proving their critiques wrong.\n\n\"May patutunguhan sila.\"\n\n# References",

How much more to my friends and my outer community?\n\nOur reservations to extend the gift to people who are less related to us arises from a lack of a strong bond in the first place.

In the gift economy, things do not have an absolute objective value. Their values are subjective depending on how they are taken.\n\nAlmost everything exists in both realms, but some kinds of goods are more gift-like due to their origin and the intention of their makers.\n\nThe gift nature of certain activities are present even among people with whom we don't easily associate it with.\n\nAndy Matuschak differentiates between the startup mindset versus the researcher mindset. For a startup to succeed, it has to produce a product. It needs to produce a product to sell. It fails if it doesn't produce that. Meanwhile, the researcher cannot force insight. [[Insight cannot be predetermined]]. If a researcher takes on a startup mindset just to produce a product, he will compromise the very nature of his trade. This is the reason why Andy has his work supported by funding through patrons in Patreon. In early iterations of his patronage model, he doesn't even offer any perks to patrons, just the opportunity to support him. Recently, he has introduced office hours and the privilege of contacting him as perks to his membership tiers. But that's it.\n\nAndy's understanding of the difference between intentions we bring with our work attests to the fact that art could exist in both market exchange and gift realms but certain categories of human activities are more gift-like and thrive more in a gift context (i.e., not intentionally created to be commoditized).\n\nRelated\n\nWhat is my gift?\n\nA deep and continuous renewing appreciation of life, curiousity, gratitude, perspective, and love of learning. A philosophical and even religious quest to learn how to live.\n\nThis feeling of deep connection with life that I have always felt is unique to me and which I couldn't find in my immediate environment.

Sometimes, it is framed as the [[Means]] that must be used to attempt to reach the desired end state.\n\nThe end state that we reach through an [[thoughts/action]] or a set of actions (i.e., [[Project]]) is ultimately a [[Mental state]] and it can never be predicted. We can only try but there are no assurances that our desired mental state will indeed be generated. What we can predict (i.e., what we can control), is the choice of the means (or actions and projects) we take to attempt to reach the desired end.\n\nTherefore, we can frame a goal as a mental state (e.g., \"I want to feel happy\") or an action (e.g., \"I want to do A\"). This implies that a better definition for what a goal is is that it is an [[thoughts/intention]]. An intention is an expression of a desire, an approximation of future actions or states.\n\nWhen setting goals, it is good to touch base on both the utimate end (i.e., the mental state brought about by a means) and the means itself, the latter being more practical.\n",

For example:\n\n1. We want to do things not just have the experience of doing them.\n2. We want to be a certain kind of person.\n3. Plugging in the machine limits us to a man-made reality.\n4. When a person is connected to the experience machine, the concept of free will becomes murky.\n\nThese reasons for not plugging in the experience machine shows that we are concerned not just how our time is filled but also with what we are. We want to have deeper significance (i.e., meaning). We choose not to plug in because something other than experience matters to us ([[Happiness is not the same as meaning]]).\n\nThis thought experiment attempts to refute [[Hedonism]] or the idea that happiness is the ultimate good by making us choose between a simulated reality and real life. As the experiment shows, there are things that increases a person's well-being beyond happiness, which makes hedonism false. If hedonism was true then we would not hesitate plugging into this machine.\n\nIn [[Scott Barry Kaufman]]'s revision of [[Maslow’s heirarchy of needs]], he argues that the highest mental state a human can achieve is [[thoughts/transcendence]].

  "/Henry-David-Thoreau-Stanford-Encyclopedia": {
    "title": "Henry David Thoreau Stanford Encyclopedia",
    "content": "\nHe sought to revive a conception of philosophy as a way of life, not only a mode of reflective thought and discourse.\n\nHe was well-versed in classical Greek and Roman philosophy, ranging from the pre-Socratics through the Hellenistic schools, and was also an avid student of the ancient scriptures and wisdom literature of various Asian traditions. He was familiar with modern philosophy ranging from Descartes, Locke and the Cambridge Platonists through Emerson, Coleridge, and the German Idealists, all of whom are influential on Thoreau’s philosophy.\n\nHis philosophical explorations of self and world led him to develop an epistemology of embodied perception and a non-dualistic account of mental and material life. In addition to his focus on ethics in an existential spirit, Thoreau also makes unique contributions to ontology, the philosophy of science, and radical political thought.\n\nThoreau’s work anticipates certain later developments in pragmatism, phenomenology, and environmental philosophy, and poses a perennially valuable challenge to our conception of the methods and intentions of philosophy itself.\n\nMost of his published writings were developed from notes that first appeared on these pages, and Thoreau subsequently revised many entries, so his journal can be considered a finished work in itself.\n\nThoreau viewed his existential quest as a venture in philosophy, in the ancient Greek sense of the word, because it was motivated by an urgent need to find a reflective understanding of reality that could inform a life of wisdom. This is because, according to the view of philosophy as a way of life, that very way of life “will necessarily be deliberative and reflective”; accordingly, for Thoreau, “thinking about his life in the woods is central to his life in the woods” (Bates 2012, 29).\n\nit is a work of narrative prose which often soars to poetic heights, combining philosophical speculation with close observation of a concrete place. It is a rousing summons to the examined life and to the realization of one’s potential, while at the same time it develops what might be described as a religious vision of the human being and the universe.\n\nwhether or not it ought to be called a work of philosophy—it contains a substantial amount of philosophical content, which deserves to be better appreciated than it has been.\n\nStanley Cavell has argued that Thoreau is an embarrassment to “what we have learned to call philosophy,” since his work embodies “a mode of conceptual accuracy” that is “based on an idea of rigor” somewhat foreign to the academic establishment (Cavell 1988, 14).\n\nThoreau—like Descartes in the _Meditations_—begins his argument by accounting for how he has come to believe that certain questions need to be addressed.\n\nhis method is predicated on the belief that it is philosophically worthwhile to clarify the basis of your own perplexity and unrest (see Reid 2012, 46)\n\na significant part of the challenge in coming to terms with Thoreau is that his philosophy, like Nietzsche’s, has a literary and poetic quality. The reader is charged with finding the coherence of Thoreau’s whole philosophical outlook.\n\nFor the most part, Thoreau recoils from the idea that we could find some kind of higher reality by looking beyond nature\n\nAs he sees it, the realm of spirit _is_the physical world, which has a sacred meaning that can be directly perceived. Accordingly, he seeks “to be always on the alert to find God in nature” (_Journal_, 9/7/51), and to hear “the language which all things and events speak without metaphor” (_Walden_, IV).\n\nThoreau’s metaphysical convictions compel him to “defend nature’s intrinsic value.\"\n\nThoreau reports that his goal is to “state facts” in such a way that “they shall be significant,” (_Journal_, 11/9/51 \u0026 8/5/51).\n\nhe does not accept that whatever we register through our aesthetic and emotional responses ought to be viewed as unreal.\n\nThoreau would argue that the person who is seldom moved by the beauty of things is the one with an inadequate conception of reality, since it is the neutral observer who is less well aware of the world as it is.\n\nTo say that nature is inherently significant is to say that natural facts are neither inert nor value-free.\n\nThoreau does not introduce an artificial distinction between facts and values, or between primary and secondary qualities, since he understands the universe as an organic whole in which mind and matter are inseparable. When we perceive sights, sounds, and textures, we are not standing as disembodied consciousness apart from a world of inanimate mechanisms; rather, we are sentient beings immersed in the sensory world, learning the “essential facts of life” only through “the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us” (_Walden_, II).\n\nthese properties are not projected onto nature from an external perspective—rather, they emerge from within the self-maintaining processes of organic life. And the entire environment, the “living earth” itself, has something like a life of its own, containing but not reducible to the biotic existence of animals and plants (_Walden_, XVII). This is what he elsewhere describes as the “slumbering subterranean fire in nature which never goes out” (“A Winter Walk”).\n\nWhat he calls “wildness” is not located only in the nonhuman world; the same creative force is also active in human nature, so that even a literary work of art can reasonably be praised as a manifestation of wildness (see “Walking”).\n\nThere are reasons for classifying Thoreau as both a naturalist and a romantic, although both of these categories are perhaps too broad to be very helpful. His conception of nature is informed by a syncretic appropriation of Greek, Roman, Indian, and other sources, and the result is an eclectic vision that is uniquely his own. For this reason it is difficult to situate Thoreau within the history of modern philosophy, but one plausible way of doing so would be to describe him as articulating a version of transcendental idealism. If Thoreau is indeed “the American heir to Kant’s critical philosophy,” as he has been called (Oelschlaeger 1991, 136), it is because his investigation of “the relation between the subject of knowledge and its object” builds upon a Kantian insight that Emerson, who viewed the senses as illusory, arguably did not grasp (see Cavell 1992, 94–95).\n\nIf one were asked to name the cardinal virtue of Thoreau’s philosophy, it would be hard to identify a better candidate than _awareness_. He attests to the importance of “being forever on the alert,” and of “the discipline of looking always at what is to be seen” (_Walden_, IV).\n\nAwareness cannot be classified as exclusively a moral or an intellectual virtue, either, since knowing is an inescapably practical and evaluative activity—not to mention, an embodied practice. Thoreau portrays himself not from a presumably neutral or impersonal vantage point, “but from an embodied point of view” in which his somatic sensory experience puts him “knowingly in touch with” his surroundings (Goodman 2012, 36). For such reasons as these, he has sometimes been interpreted as a “philosopher of the senses” (Mooney 2009, 195), who offers an original response to the central problem of modern philosophy as a consequence of recognizing that knowledge is “dependent on the individual’s _ability_to see,” and that “the world as known is thus radically dependent on character” (Tauber 2001, 4–5).\n\nOne of the common tenets of ancient philosophy which was abandoned in the period beginning with Descartes is that a person “could not have access to the truth” without undertaking a process of self-purification that would render him “susceptible to knowing the truth” (Foucault 1997, 278–279). For Thoreau, it was the work of a lifetime to cultivate one’s receptivity to the beauty of the universe. Believing that “the perception of beauty is a moral test” (_Journal_, 6/21/52), Thoreau frequently chastises himself or humanity in general for failing in this respect.\n\nIn order to attain a clear and truthful view of things, we must refine all the faculties of our embodied consciousness, and become emotionally attuned to all the concrete features of the place in which we are located. We fully know only those facts that are “warm, moist, incarnated,” and palpably felt: “A man has not seen a thing who has not felt it” (_Journal_, 2/23/60). In this way, Thoreau outlines an epistemological task that will occupy him for the rest of his life; namely, to cultivate a way of attending to things that will allow them to be experienced as elements of a meaningful world.\n\nSince our ability to appreciate the significance of phenomena is so easily dulled, it requires a certain discipline in order to become and remain a reliable knower of the world. Like Aristotle, Thoreau believes that the perception of truth “produces a pleasurable sensation”; and he adds that a “healthy and refined nature would always derive pleasure from the landscape” (_Journal_, 9/24/54 \u0026 6/27/52).\n\nFrom his experience in the field making observations of natural phenomena, Thoreau gained the insight “that he, the supposedly neutral observer, was always and unavoidably in the center of the observation” (McGregor 1997, 113). Because all perception of objects has a subjective aspect, the world can be defined as a sphere centered around each conscious perceiver: wherever we are located, “the universe is built around us, and we are central still” (_Journal_, 8/24/41). This does not mean that we are trapped inside of our own consciousness; rather, the point is that it is only through the lens of our own subjectivity that we have access to the external world.\n\nWhat we are able to perceive, then, depends not only upon where we are physically situated: it is also contingent upon who we are and what we value, or how our attention is focused.\n\nIn other words, there is “no such thing as pure _objective_ observation. Your observation, to be interesting, i.e. to be significant, must be _subjective_” (_Journal_, 5/6/54). Subjectivity is not an obstacle to truth, according to Thoreau.\n\nA true account of the world must do justice to all the familiar properties of objects that the human mind is capable of perceiving. Whether this could be done by a scientific description is a vexing question for Thoreau, and one about which he shows considerable ambivalence. One of his concerns is that the scientist “discovers no world for the mind of man with all its faculties to inhabit”; by contrast, there is “more humanity” in “the unscientific man’s knowledge,” since the latter can explain how certain facts pertain to life (_Journal_, 9/5/51, 2/13/52).\n\nFor Thoreau, the most reliable observer is one who can “see things as they are, grand and beautiful” (_Journal_, 1/7/57)—in other words, the beauty and grandeur of the world really are there to be seen, even if we are not always capable of seeing them. We can easily fail to perceive the value of being if we do not approach the world with the appropriate kind of emotional comportment.\n\nThoreau sometimes characterizes science as an ideal discipline that will enrich our knowledge and experience: “The true man of science will know nature better by his finer organization; he will smell, taste, see, hear, feel, better than other men. His will be a deeper and finer experience” (“Natural History of Massachusetts”). He observes that scientific terminology can provide the means of apprehending something that we had utterly missed until we had a name for it (see Walls 2012, 108). Yet he also gives voice to the fear that by weighing and measuring things and collecting quantitative data he may actually be narrowing his vision.\n\nhe repeatedly questions its value, as if he does not know what to make of his own penchant for naturalistic research. At the very least, scientific investigations run the risk of being “trivial and petty,” so perhaps what one should do is “learn science and then forget it” (_Journal_, 1/21/53 \u0026 4/22/52). But Thoreau is more deeply troubled by the possibility that “science is inhuman,” since objects “seen with a microscope begin to be insignificant,” and this is “not the means of acquiring true knowledge” (_Journal_, 5/1/59 \u0026 5/28/54). Overall, his position is not that a mystical or imaginative awareness of the world is incompatible with knowledge of measurable facts, but that an exclusive focus on the latter would blind us to whatever aspects of reality fall outside the scope of our measurement.\n\nOne thing we can learn from all of Thoreau’s comments on scientific inquiry is that he cares very much about the following question: what can we know about the world, and how are we able to know it? Although he admires the precision of scientific information, he wonders if what it delivers is always bound to be “something less than the vague poetic” (_Journal_, 1/5/50).\n\nthe best we can do is try to convey our intimations of the truth about the universe, even if this means venturing far beyond claims that are positivistically verifiable.\n\nWe should not arbitrarily limit our awareness to that which can be described with mathematical exactitude.\n\nBy acknowledging the limits of what we can know with certainty, we open ourselves up to a wider horizon of experience.\n\nAs one commentator points out, Thoreau’s categories—so to speak—are dynamic, since they are constantly being redefined by what we perceive, even as they shape our way of seeing (Peck 1990, 84–85).\n\nSince the thoughts of each knowing subject are “part of the meaning of the world,” it is legitimate to ask: “Who can say what _is_? He can only say _how_ he_sees_” (11/4/52 \u0026 12/2/46). Truth is radically perspective-dependent, which means that insofar as we are different people we can only be expected to perceive different worlds (Walls 1995, 213). Thoreau’s position might be described as perspectival realism, since he does not conclude that truth is relative but celebrates the diversity of the multifaceted reality that each of us knows in his own distinctive way.\n\nWe may never comprehend the intimate relation between a significant fact and the perceiver who appreciates it, but we should trust that it is not in vain to view nature with “humane affections” (_Journal_, 2/20/57 \u0026 6/30/52). With respect to any given phenomenon, the “point of interest” that concerns us lies neither in the coolly independent object nor in the subject alone, but somewhere in between (_Journal_, 11/5/57). Witnessing the rise of positivism and its ideal of complete objectivity, Thoreau attempts “to preserve an enchanted world and to place the passionate observer in the center of his or her universe” (Tauber 2001, 20). It is an admirable goal, and one that remains quite relevant in the philosophical climate of the present day.\n\nThoreau’s ethic of personal flourishing is focused upon the problem of how to align one’s daily life in accordance with one’s ultimate ideals (_Journal_, 11/1/51 \u0026 11/24/57).\n\nHence, we need to cherish and nurture our capability to discern the difference between the idea and the reality, between _what is_and _what ought to be_. It is when we experience dissatisfaction with ourselves or with external circumstances that we are stimulated to act in the interest of making things better.\n\nThoreau is “squarely in the virtue ethics tradition” (Cafaro 2004, 127).\n\nIt would be a mistake to consider Thoreau’s political views in isolation from other aspects of his thought. It is, for example, his understanding of wild nature that informs his sociopolitical ideas. As was noted above, nature is a point of reference outside the _polis_ which can provide valuable moral guidance, reminding us that society is not the measure of all things. Considering the human being as “an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature,” rather than a cultural artifact merely (“Walking”), he looks to the nonhuman natural world and to our inherent “wildness” as a source of evaluation which can empower us to discover that the standards of our civilization are profoundly flawed. His conviction that nature provides us with “a different, truer, and more significant moral reality” than what we find in society provides the “crucial and often overlooked political core” to what has been called his “pastoral environmentalism” (Taylor 1992, 12-24). Withdrawing into the natural world allows us to view the state in a broader context and to conceive of ways in which social values and political structures could be improved radically.\n\nIn denouncing a specific pernicious attitude that is widespread among his contemporaries, Thoreau also seeks to identify and analyze the general tendency it exemplifies to defer to public opinion: for this reason, his project of social critique is not only relevant to his parochial context but has universal implications. He is acutely conscious of the threat that shared modes of discourse can pose to authentic intersubjectivity.\n\nNot only is it true that a degree of solitude and distance from our neighbors may actually improve our relations with them, but by moving away from the center of town we liberate ourselves from a slavish adherence to prevailing attitudes.\n\nBecause Thoreau understood philosophy as a way of life, it is only fitting that philosophical ideals would lead him into political action.\n\nWhen Thoreau argues that all of Brown’s actions were justified _because_ he was an inspired reformer with a sacred vocation, he is appealing to something like the notion of natural right.\n\nAlthough at times it sounds as though Thoreau is advocating anarchy, what he demands is a _better_ government, and what he refuses to acknowledge is the authority of one that has become so morally corrupt as to lose the consent of those governed. “There will never be a really free and enlightened State, ” he argues, “until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly” (“Civil Disobedience”). There are simply more sacred laws to obey than the laws of society, and a just government—should there ever be such a thing, he adds—would not be in conflict with the conscience of the ethically upright individual.\n\na better way of situating Thoreau within the Western philosophical tradition is to consider him a kind of transcendental idealist, in the spirit of Kant. For reasons that ought to be obvious by now, he should be of interest to students of Kant, Fichte, and Schelling—all of whom he studied at first or second hand—and possibly Schopenhauer. Thoreau was a capable and enthusiastic classicist, whose study of ancient Greek and Roman authors convinced him that philosophy ought to be a lived practice: for this reason, he can profitably be grouped with other nineteenth-century thinkers, such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, who were critics of philosophy in the early modern period. Yet he also has the distinction of being among the first Western philosophers to be significantly influenced by ancient Chinese and Indian thought. He anticipates Bergson and Merleau-Ponty in his attention to the dynamics of the embodied mind, and shares with Peirce and James a concern for problems of knowledge as they arise within practical experience.\n\n# References\n\nFurtak, R.

  "/How-I-Became-a-Professional-Multipotentialite": {
    "title": "How I Became a Professional Multipotentialite",
    "content": "\n![Multipotentialite desk](Multipotentialite-desk.jpg)\n\nThis year, I realized I actually became a professional [multipotentialite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotentiality). The word multipotentialite was coined after the educational and psychological term \"multipotentiality,\" which was defined by [Tamara Fisher](https://www.edweek.org/education/opinion-multipotentiality/2010/08) as \"the state of having many _exceptional_ talents, any one or more of which could make for a great career for that person.\"\n\nA multipotentialite then is a person who is _strongly_ drawn towards a variety of interests. One can argue that all human beings are drawn towards many interests at different points in their lives. However, some people, particularly children and young adults, experience tremendous anxiety over this that psychologists and educators have to invent a term to refer to their disposition. While this state of mind can be seen as a blessing for some, most people with it have been troubled by it one way or another. As Fisher continues:\n\n\u003e On the bright side, they have many realistic options for future careers. But on the downside, some of them will struggle mightily trying to decide which choice to make. Particularly in the last couple years of high school and the first couple years of college, this monumentous decision with so many great possible outcomes can be a source of debilitating stress. The choice is 'exhausting and stressful,' as one of my students said this year.\n\nFor those who have made peace with this state of mind, they've either explored their interests simultaneously or sequentially. A \"successful\" multipotentialite—someone who has achieved mastery and prestige in multiple interests—is called a \"polymath.\" Leonardo Da Vinci is perhaps the most famous polymath of all. Since multipotentiality only refers to the state of mind and not necessarily involve the \"success\" of an individual, we can make the argument that not all multipotentialites become polymaths, but all polymaths started out as multipotentialites.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that \"success,\" as society defines it, requires some measure of adhering to conventions, and this isn't always attractive to multipotentialites. Actually, I would guess that most multipotentialites don't care about these things. The majority will be motivated only by two things: (1) the satisfaction of doing whatever they care about and (2) the freedom to shift interests whenever they want. These two motivators don't usually translate to \"success\" in mainstream terms, so multipotentialites create their own definition of success.\n\nFor me, personally, as long as I have these two things in my life, I have succeeded. Freedom and happiness are everything to me. Obviously, honoring my multipotentiality isn't the only contributor to freedom and happiness, but it serves a major role in my life right now.\n\nAnother important note: The term \"professional multipotentialite\" is my own way of referring to multipotentialites who: (a) have accepted and made peace with their multipotentiality, (b) made an intention to make it an important part of their life, and (c) have made or are working out actions that would make it easier for them to pursue their multipotentiality.\n\n## How I Realized I Was a Multipotentialite\n\nI first learned about my \"tendency\" to shift interests after graduating from college in 2013. I remember Googling the following question: \"What will I do with my life if I have too many interests?\" This led me to a [post by Emilie Wapnick](http://paidtoexist.com/one-true-calling/), who introduced me to a whole new way of existing that was right under my nose. How can something that most of us did when we were children (play around and shift from one thing to another) vanish in adulthood? I was just amazed to realize this.\n\nBut back then, much of my experience with multipotentiality was connected to the stress of not knowing what career to pursue. I was still coming from this framework that I need to choose one thing. I was just 21 at that time and no one has ever told me that I could refuse to choose. The confusion was also partly amplified by my [dark night of the soul in 2011](https://vinceimbat.com/seven-lessons-i-learned-since-my-depression-in-2011/), which prompted me to leave an old way of living, and with it, a clear career path. Nothing could make one as confused about where to go in life than trauma and leaving an old belief system.\n\nAnd yet, learning about multipotentialites through [Emilie's blog](https://puttylike.com/) gave me some hope. I took baby steps to attempt to construct a life that would allow me to accommodate a few if not all my interests. One of those (not so) baby steps was [[My 2013–2014 annual review|rejecting two opportunities to teach]] (one at a university and another at a high school) in favor of freelancing. While it was definitely a hard decision to make at that time, it is one of the best decisions I have ever made. Freelancing, while not ideal, was flexible enough to allow me to dedicate enough time to explore my interests and learn more about myself. I have been a freelancer ever since graduating in 2013.\n\n## The Struggles of Building a Multifaceted Life\n\nNevertheless, building a life around my different passions was a tough ride. From [[tags/annual-reviews/_index|2013–2019]], I went through lots of frustrations particularly on just trying to set things up: my business, my routines, my habits, etc. The time I spent setting up my life robbed a lot of the time I could have spent nurturing my passions. This, in turn, made me feel guilty.\n\nMany times, I wanted to shake off my multipotentiality and return to the \"focus on one thing\" credo. Having a traditional job could have solved a lot of my problems at that time: I would have had a strict schedule that I could organize around. Many multipotentialites have made this work with them and I now advocate that serious multipotentialites who would like to focus on nurturing their interests instead of building businesses could be greatly helped by the [\"good enough job\"](https://puttylike.com/dont-let-anyone-shame-you-for-having-a-day-job/) model. However, back then, I was mainly concerned about extending my freedom and freelancing sounded so good to let go.\n\nSince then, I learned that there is more to constructing a multipotentialite life than choosing more flexible employment like freelancing. I realized that if I wanted to be a \"professional\" multipotentialite, I need the following:\n\n1. Time affluence\n2. Financial and material security\n3. A life system\n4. Reasonably good health\n\nI discuss how I tackled the four below.\n\n## 1\\. Time Affluence\n\nThe more time I have, the better.\n\nIn a day, I have roughly 12 hours of time to use for my passion (24 hours less sleeping time and whatever time I use to managing my life). I asked myself, \"How much of those 12 hours am I able to dedicate to the things that make my heart sing?\"\n\nFor me, it is always about those 12 hours. Unlike other people, I need to divide those 12 hours into three, five, or even more interests in any given day.\n\nI reasoned to myself, it's easy for me to say that I am interested in this or that thing, but to dedicate time for what I say is important to me is the only proof that what I tell myself is true. If I am not giving time to the things I say is important to me, I should probably have to accept one day that these things may not really be that important to me.\n\n## 2\\. Financial and Material Security\n\nBased on my experience, it doesn't matter if you I have all those 12 hours in a day to pursue my interests if I always worrying whether I'll have enough money next month. That anxiety eats up all my time. This is basic Maslow's hierarchy of needs. And I don't have to be rich or financially independent. I just have to have \"peace of mind.\"\n\nThe way I experience it (and others will also attest to this), creativity requires some measure of peace of mind. Yes, others were able to create masterpieces in the middle of chaos and even mental illness. But one can't help to wonder, how much more they could have done if they were in a \"better\" place.\n\nFor me, like most ordinary mortals, if I don't have some peace of mind, I won't be able to pursue my interests happily. If I don't find happiness in pursuing my interests, I will start associating them with negative emotions, which, in turn, will force me to abandon them altogether.\n\nThis is something I only realized after struggling a lot with anxiety over employment. I realized later on that if I really value my interests, I need a sustainable source of income. For people interested in building a multifaceted life, I would always recommend them to start with a \"good enough job\" first, which they would use to fund their runway to transition to a more enjoyable source of income (usually, freelancing or entrepreneurship). My reason for giving this advice is that while freelancing or entrepreneurship provides more flexibility of time, they can actually start to rob most of those 12 free hours because one needs to do A LOT: marketing, prospecting, onboarding, networking, setting up systems, doing your taxes, accounting, etc.\n\nThis is especially true when one is just starting out. Some people make it work. They jump right into freelancing or entrepreneurship while they pursue their interests simultaneously. But this model requires a lot of discipline. The question that one needs to ask if one is considering following such a path is this: \"Do I have that discipline? Or do I still need to learn how to be my own boss?\"\n\nWhen I started to do freelancing, I just got out of college. College, unfortunately, did not teach productivity or time-management (weird because college is one of the most time-demanding places in the world!). So while I think I was more disciplined than most of my friends, I still struggled—a lot. I struggled with prioritizing my tasks, spending a lot of time with tasks that turned out to be complete wastes of time. I failed to manage my finances, living paycheck-to-paycheck, and always worried whether a new client would discover me next month. I failed to find and work with the right clients. I even had a legal threat once!\n\nFreelancing is a complicated journey with a steep learning curve that people should stop treating it like a walk in a park. It isn't. It requires the same dedication that you need to dedicate to your other interests if you are a serious multipotentialite. And this means that if you are pursuing learning how to freelance and nurturing your other interests at the same time, you need above-average discipline. And again, the question you need to ask yourself is do you have above-average discipline right now?\n\nLooking back, I could have spared myself of all the anxiety that freelancing generated and kept most of my 12 hours for pursuing my passions if I just found myself a \"good enough job\" to start with (say a part-time job or a remote work job that is almost similar to freelancing less the marketing and prospecting for clients, which is time-consuming and, frankly, financially unstable when you are just starting out).\n\nIn 2017, I found my good enough job as an editor for a publishing services company based in the United States. It was a remote job position that required me to work about four hours a day for six days a week. I pursued my interests in the morning and worked in the afternoon. The pay was good and I never worried about money. In 2019, I transitioned into an even better job. I now only work for 5–10 days a month, while I make the same money I did in my previous job. I am grateful for all the time I have to pursue what makes my heart sing. I wish everyone who dreams of being a professional multipotentialite to find their own peace of mind, so they can start following their passions more happily.\n\n## 3\\. Life System\n\nI won't stop repeating myself. It's all about time.\n\nNow, I realized further down my journey that it doesn't matter if I have all my 12 hours and my financial life is settled if I am overwhelmed with information and tasks as I start pursuing my various interests.\n\nWhat I found out was that I need to have a minimum viable life system in place that would help me plan, manage, track, and reflect on my various projects so I will, again, feel peace of mind and satisfaction from my work and my multipotentiality. This is so important that I will elaborate on this in a future post, but for now, it is sufficient to say that I need to have the following to start feeling in control of my creative life:\n\n1. A system that captures notes, tasks, events, reading materials, and other inputs in digital or physical inboxes\n2. A system that keeps me connected with my core desired mental states, values, purpose, mission, vision, and goals.\n3. A system that allows me to review #1 and #2 regularly so that my actions are always connected with my desires.\n\nAfter many years of playing around this, I was finally able to setup my minimum vialble life system this 2020, and it has changed my life profoundly.\n\n## 4\\. Reasonably Good Health\n\nI don't have to be a triathlete. I don't have to have abs or biceps. But I do need to be healthy enough to be able to enjoy my free time. Managing a health problem, especially a chronic one, can feel like a part-time job by itself, especially just after diagnosis. So it doesn't matter if I have all the time, money, or life system; if I am sick, I won't be able to take full advantage of all those privileges. Health should be my top priority before everything else.\n\nI know this very well. Just last year, which extended to the first half of this year, I dealt with an [[My 2019 Annual Review|ear infection]], which got worse and led to tinnitus. I wasn't able to work or do art from January to February this year as I adjusted to the psychological effects of the nonstop ringing in my left ear. I was time affluent, I was making enough money, and I had an okay life system. But all my resources went to managing my health problem.\n\n## It's All About Emotions\n\nNeeds 2–4 are meant to address areas of my life that, if left uncovered, will (1) steal my free time and (2) prevent me from actually enjoying what is left from my hard-earned free time that I should be using to explore my passions. No matter how much free time I have, if I am experiencing a mix of fear, anxiety, stress, exhaustion, etc. brought by inadequacies in these three needs, I won't be able to take full advantage of my time, which means my many interests won't be nurtured.\n\nI realized that to even give multipotentiality a chance, I needed to have a good handle on my own emotional states. I haven't figured everything out, but this year, I have achieved equilibrium in all these four needs, enough to allow me to actually dedicate quality time to my passions:\n\n1. I have about 20 free days every month.\n2. I earn enough to not worry about money.\n3. I have established a minimum viable life system.\n4. I have reasonably good health.\n\n## The Power of the Minimum Viable\n\nAgain, it is worth repeating that I don't need to have all of these four needs covered perfectly in order to start being pro in pursuing my multipotentiality. I just have to have the minimum viable set up in all four areas that generate the peace of mind that I need to just start.\n\nMy framework will not work for everyone, but if you think it could work for you and you want to try it out for yourself, here is how you would know that you have a minimum viable multipotentialite system:\n\n- You feel like you have enough time for at least two passions every month, and you are free to switch from one passion to another whenever you want.\n- You don't worry about money.\n- You don't feel overwhelmed by the information and tasks that enter your life.\n- You have healthy habits that prevent you from getting terribly sick.\n\nOnce you got all these basic needs covered, you can start experiencing true multipotentialite freedom—the freedom to completely immerse yourself in any interest whenever you like and whatever way you like.\n",

    "content": "\nMelville made Moby-Dick into an ambitious literary achievement that didn't pay that much among his contemporaries. His unconventional taste was inspired by the quality of books he was reading. Specifically, Melville's biggest influences were Nathaniel Hawthorne (which connects him to transcendentalism and unitarianism) and Shakespeare.\n\n## References\n\nKleon, A. (2018, October 2). The right book at the right time. Austin Kleon. https://austinkleon.com/2018/10/02/the-right-book-at-the-right-time/\n\n\u003e Although it would prove financially disastrous, Melville felt pulled beyond writing what he knew would be popular with his contemporaries. (“What I most feel moved to write, that is banned, —it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the other way I cannot.”) A lot of this feeling was exacerbated by the quality of the books he was reading. (Let that be a lesson to you: read the Big Dogs, and you might be doomed by your lit’ry ambitions!)\n\n\u003e Coming to literature relatively late in life, Melville did so not with the reluctance of an unwilling recipient of some institutionally imposed reading-list, but with the wide-eyed eagerness of the autodidact, hungry for the resources of the world’s great books… Melville never made any mystery of his sources, passing them on (not showing them off) in the ‘Extracts’ with which Moby-Dick begins: the Bible, Montaigne, Shakespeare…. [T]he more he read, the more Melville wanted to emulate what he read… he wanted to find a way of writing that would enable him to meld together all that he found valuable in other works. And this, more or less, as his diaries and letters describe it, was the state of mind, the state of readiness, in which he sat down to write Moby-Dick: full to the brim with the world’s literature, in a state of something like intellectual frenzy.\n\n\u003e Melville remains one of the best American examples of how every important writer is foremost an indefatigable reader of golden books, someone who kneels at the altar of literature not only for wisdom, sustenance, and emotional enlargement, but with the crucial intent of filching fire from the gods.",

On the backside I write down the bibliographic details. After finishing the book I go through my notes and think how these notes might be relevant for already written notes in the slip-box. It means that I always read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.”\n\nreflect as much on what is not mentioned as what is mentioned.\n\nYou need to take some form of literature note that captures your understanding of the text, so you have something in front of your eyes while you are making the slip-box note. But don’t turn it into a project in itself. Literature notes are short and meant to help with writing slip-box notes.\n\n**Notes during exploration will tend to be more extensive**\n\n**The Talakahon prevents confirmation bias**\n\nConfirmation bias is tackled here in two steps: First, by turning the whole writing process on its head, and secondly, by changing the incentives from finding confirming facts to an indiscriminate gathering of any relevant information regardless of what argument it will support.\n\n**Linear process of writing promotes confirmation bias**\n\nThe linear process promoted by most study guides, which insanely starts with the decision on the hypothesis or the topic to write about, is a sure-fire way to let confirmation bias run rampant. First, you basically fix your present understanding, as the outcome instead of using it as the starting point, priming yourself for one-sided perception. Then you artificially create a conflict of interest between getting things done (finding support for your preconceived argument) and generating insight, turning any departure from your preconceived plan into a mutiny against the success of your own project. This is a good rule of thumb: If insight becomes a threat to your academic or writing success, you are doing it wrong.\n\n**The bottom-up development of arguments in the Talakahon facilitate insight**\n\nDeveloping arguments and ideas bottom-up instead of top-down is the first and most important step to opening ourselves up for insight. We should be able to focus on the most insightful ideas we encounter and welcome the most surprising turns of events without jeopardizing our progress or, even better, because it brings our project forward. We postpone the decision on what to write about specifically and focus on building a critical mass within the slip-box.\n\nOnly then do we take a step back to look at what developed, then make a decision on what conclusions are to be drawn from that.\n\n**If it connects with other things in the Talakahon, it gets added there**\n\nhe only criterion is the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box. The only thing that matters is that it connects or is open to connections. Everything can contribute to the development of thoughts within the slip-box: an addition as well as a contradiction, the questioning of a seemingly obvious idea as well as the differentiation of an argument.\n\n**Talakahon invites disconfirming data**\n\ndis-confirming data becomes suddenly very attractive, because it opens up more possible connections and discussions within the slip-box\n\nThe slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed. It just prefers relevant notes. It is after reading and collecting relevant data, connecting thoughts and discussing how they fit together that it is time to draw conclusions and develop a linear structure for the argument.\n\n**Move your attention from projects to open connections in the Talakahon**\n\n**Extracting the gist of a text or idea and giving account in writing constitutes practice for a nonfiction writer**\n\n**Reframing knowledge is more important than having extensive knoweldge**\n\nBeing able to re-frame questions, assertions and information is even more important than having an extensive knowledge, because without this ability, we wouldn’t be able to put our knowledge to use.\n\n**Write permanent notes as if you are writing to your future self, ignorant of your past self**\n\n**Rereading is dangerous**\n\nReading, especially rereading, can easily fool us into believing we understand a text. Rereading is especially dangerous because of the mere-exposure effect: The moment we become familiar with something, we start believing we also understand it.\n\n**Rephrasing an argument helps us check if we really understood it**\n\n**Traditional education is like fast food**\n\nit helps to remember how much effort teachers still put into the attempt to make learning easier for their students by prearranging information, sorting it into modules, categories and themes. By doing that, they achieve the opposite of what they intend to do. They make it harder for the student to learn because they set everything up for reviewing, taking away the opportunity to build meaningful connections and to make sense of something by translating it into one’s own language. It is like fast food: It is neither nutritious nor very enjoyable, it is just convenient.\n\n**Elaboration**\n\nElaboration means nothing other than really thinking about the meaning of what we read, how it could inform different questions and topics and how it could be combined with other knowledge.\n\nThe challenge of writing as well as learning is therefore not so much to learn, but to understand, as we will already have learned what we understand. The problem is that the meaning of something is not always obvious and needs to be explored. That is why we need to elaborate on it. But elaboration is nothing more than connecting information to other information in a meaningful way. The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a piece of information so we are able to write about it. The second step is to think about what it means for other contexts as well.\n\nBy elaborating on what we encounter, we also discover aspects we didn’t know anything about before and therefore develop our interests along the way.\n\n**Elaboration is the best-researched and most successful learning method**\n\nthe best-researched and most successful learning method is elaboration. It is very similar to what we do when we take smart notes and combine them with others\n\n**Talakahon promotes elaboration**\n\nWriting notes and sorting them into the slip-box is nothing other than an attempt to understand the wider meaning of something. The slip-box forces us to ask numerous elaborating questions: What does it mean? How does it connect to … ? What is the difference between … ? What is it similar to? That the slip-box is not sorted by topics is the precondition for actively building connections between notes.\n\nelaborating on the differences and similarities of notes instead of sorting them by topic not only facilitates learning, but facilitates the ability to categorise and create sensible classifications!\n\n**Talakahon frees up the brain to be creative**\n\nThere is a clear division of labour between the brain and the slip-box: The slip-box takes care of details and references and is a long-term memory resource that keeps information objectively unaltered. That allows the brain to focus on the gist, the deeper understanding and the bigger picture, and frees it up to be creative.\n\n**Effective reading**\n\nread a text with questions in mind and try to relate it to other possible approaches\n\nspot the limitations of a particular approach and see what is not mentioned in the text.\n\nthink hard about how they connect with other ideas from different contexts and could inform questions that are not already the questions of the author of the respective text.\n\n**Three Talakahon notes a day is enough**\n\nyou could settle for three notes a day and still build up a significant critical mass of ideas in a very reasonable time. And you could settle for less than one book every twelve months.\n\nmeasure your daily productivity by the number of notes written.\n\n**To think about the idea effectively, we need to write it down**\n\nOnly in the written form can an argument be looked at with a certain distance – literally. We need this distance to think about an argument – otherwise the argument itself would occupy the very mental resources we need for scrutinizing it.\n\n**Embed an idea into the Talakahon by writing about its importance to your own line of thought**\n\nA common way to embed an idea into the context of the slip-box is by writing out the reasons of its importance for your own lines of thought.\n\nthe first question I asked myself when it came to writing the first permanent note for the slip-box was: What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box? This is just another way of asking: Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest?\n\ntwo notes in my slip-box, based on the literature notes I took while reading the book, but written along the lines of my own thinking. One note states the relevance of the book for my own thinking and one explains my idea in more detail. Here I could draw from my literature notes as a source of valuable facts and insight.\n\nWhile I am writing these notes, it becomes obvious that the answer to the question “why” has already triggered more follow-up questions\n\n**Skimming through the Talakahon reveals topics to write about**\n\n**You do not have to discuss ideas in the Talakahon right away**\n\n**Forgetting actually facilitates long-term learning**\n\n**Two different measurements when it comes to memory**\n\nStorage strength and retrieval strength\n\n**Shift the attention from storage strength to retrieval strength**\n\nbuilding connections and bridges between pieces of information to circumvent the inhibition mechanism in the right moment\n\nmaking sure that the right “cues” trigger the right memory\n\nfocus on “retrieval strength,” we instantly start to think strategically about what kind of cues should trigger the retrieval of a memory.\n\nA writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it?\n\nIn the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?\n\n**Every piece of information can become the trigger for another piece of information**\n\n**Connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contests as possible**\n\nWhat does help for true, useful learning is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contexts as possible, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the slip-box with other notes. Making these connections deliberately means building up a self-supporting network of interconnected ideas and facts that work reciprocally as cues for each other.\n\n**The Talakahon does not require completeness**\n\nBecause the slip-box is not intended to be an encyclopaedia, but a tool to think with, we don’t need to worry about completeness. We don’t need to write anything down just to bridge a gap in a note sequence. We only write if it helps us with our own thinking.\n\n**The incompleteness of the Talakahon is bridged when writing the rough draft**\n\nThe gaps we do need to concern ourselves with are the gaps in the arguments in the final manuscript – but these gaps will only become obvious in the next step, when we take the relevant notes for an argument out of the network of the slip-box and sort them into the linear order for the rough draft.\n\n**The Talakahon does not need an overview**\n\nAs the slip-box is not a book with just one topic, we don’t need to have an overview of it. On the contrary, we are much better off accepting as early as possible that an overview of the slip-box is as impossible as having an overview of our own thinking while we are thinking.\n\n**References between a note and another note is more important than its reference to the index**\n\nMost notes will be found through other notes. The organisation of the notes is in the network of references in the slip-box, so all we need from the index are entry points. A few wisely chosen notes are sufficient for each entry point. The quicker we get from the index to the concrete notes, the quicker we move our attention from mentally preconceived ideas towards the fact-rich level of interconnected content, where we can conduct a fact-based dialogue with the slip-box\n\n**Liberating our brain from the task of organizing notes is the main purpose of the Talakahon**\n\n**The element of surprise is crucial in the Talakahon**\n\nThis crucial element of surprise comes into play on the level of the interconnected notes, not when we are looking for particular entries in the index.\n\n**The structure of topics in the Talakahon changes based on your intellectual development**\n\nthe structure of topics and subtopics is not a given, but the outcome of our thinking, they too are subject to ongoing considerations and alteration. The consideration of how to structure a topic, therefore, belongs on notes as well – and not on a meta-hierarchical level. We can provide ourselves with a (temporarily valid) overview over a topic or subtopic just by making another note. If we then link from the index to such a note, we have a good entry point. If the overview on this note ceases to correctly represent the state of a cluster or topic, or we decide it should be structured differently, we can write a new note with a better structure and update the respective link from the index. This is important: Every consideration on the structure of a topic is just another consideration on a note – bound to change and dependent on the development of our understanding.\n\nWhat we think is relevant for a topic and what is not depends on our current understanding and should be taken quite seriously: It defines an idea as much as the facts it is based on. What we regard as being relevant for a topic and how we structure it will change over time. This change might lead to another note with a different, more adequate topic structure, which then can be seen as a comment on the previous note.\n\n**Think inside the Talakahon**\n\nWe look at our slip-box for already existing lines of thought and think about the questions and problems already on our minds to which a new note might contribute.\n\n**Cross-references in the Talakahon**\n\nOverview-to-note references\n\nNote-to-note references\n\n**Overview note**\n\nThese are notes directly referred to from the index and usually used as an entry point into a topic that has already developed to such a degree that an overview is needed or at least becomes helpful. On a note like this, you can collect links to other relevant notes to this topic or question, preferably with a short indication of what to find on these notes (one or two words or a short sentence is sufficient). This kind of note helps to structure thoughts and can be seen as an in-between step towards the development of a manuscript. Above all, they help orientate oneself within the slip-box. You will know when you need to write one.\n\nLuhmann collected up to 25 links to other notes on these kind of entry notes. They don’t have to be written in one go as links can be added over time\n\n**Talakahon prevents us from forcing connections**\n\nBy dealing with actual notes, we are also less prone to imagine connections where there aren’t any, as we can see in black and white if something makes sense or not.\n\n**Talakahon prevents lofty thinking**\n\nThe slip-box is like a well-informed but down-to-earth communication partner who keeps us grounded. If we try to feed it some lofty ideas, it will force us to check first: What is the reference? How does that connect to the facts and the ideas you already have?\n\n**Talakahon helps clarify differences between concepts**\n\nthe confrontation with old notes helps to detect differences we wouldn’t have noticed otherwise. What seems to be the same idea sometimes turns out to be slightly, but crucially, different. We then can explicitly discuss this difference on another note\n\nThe clarification of differences in the use of words and concepts is a major part of every serious academic work anyway – but it is so much easier if you have a nit-picking partner like the slip-box.\n\n**Talakahon detects contradictions and oppositions**\n\nComparing notes also helps us to detect contradictions, paradoxes or oppositions – important facilitators for insight. When we realise that we used to accept two contradicting ideas as equally true, we know that we have a problem – and problems are good because we now have something to solve. A paradox can be a sign that we haven’t thought thoroughly enough about a problem or, conversely, that we exhausted the possibilities of a certain paradigm. Finally, oppositions help to shape ideas by providing contrast.\n\n**Talakahon helps us become critical readers**\n\nAdding new notes to old notes and being forced to compare them leads not only to a constant improvement of one’s own work, but often discloses weaknesses in the texts we read. We have to compensate for that by being extra critical as readers and careful with extracting information from texts, and we always have to check the original source of a claim.\n\n**Feature-positive effect**\n\nThis is the phenomenon in which we tend to overstate the importance of information that is (mentally) easily available to us and tilts our thinking towards the most recently acquired facts, not necessarily the most relevant ones. Without external help, we would not only take exclusively into account what we know, but what is on top of our heads. The slip-box constantly reminds us of information we have long forgotten and wouldn’t remember otherwise – so much so, we wouldn’t even look for it.\n\n**Talakahon is a good learning method**\n\nby working with the slip-box, we retrieve old ideas and facts on an irregular basis and connect them with other bits of information – very much how experts recommend we learn\n\nWe learn something not only when we connect it to prior knowledge and try to understand its broader implications (elaboration), but also when we try to retrieve it at different times (spacing) in different contexts (variation), ideally with the help of chance (contextual interference) and with a deliberate effort (retrieval). The slip-box not only provides us with the opportunity to learn in this proven way, it forces us to do exactly what is recommended just by using it.\n\n**Having multiple theoretical models are advantageous**\n\nOur ability to read a situation or to interpret information depends on our broader knowledge and how we make sense of it.\n\nsome theories or theoretical models are surprisingly versatile, which is why it makes sense to assemble a toolbox of useful mental models\n\nhave not just a few, but a broad range of mental models in your head. Otherwise, you risk becoming too attached to one or two and see only what fits them.\n\nYou’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience, both vicarious and direct, on this latticework of models.\n\nA truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes. This stands in harsh contrast to the common but not-so-wise belief that we need to learn from experience.\n\n**It is better to learn from experience of others**\n\nIt is much better to learn from the experiences of others – especially when this experience is reflected on and turned into versatile “mental models” that can be used in different situations.\n\n**Even writers need a practice**\n\nwe need experience until we can “feel our way” around the problems and questions we deal with, even if these things are words, concepts and notes in a file system. What we learn in practice is always much more thorough and complex than what we could put into words.\n\n**Ideas need to be abstracted and respecified to be useful**\n\nTo be able to play with ideas, we first have to liberate them from their original context by means of abstraction and re-specification. We did this when we took literature notes and translated them into the different contexts within the slip-box.\n\nAbstraction is also the key to analyse and compare concepts, to make analogies and to combine ideas; this is especially true when it comes to interdisciplinary work\n\nit is the concrete standardization of notes in just one format that enables us to literally shuffle them around, to add one idea to multiple contexts and to compare and combine them in a creative way without losing sight of what they truly contain.\n\n**Your working environment can allow you to be creative**\n\n**The ability to generate new ideas has more to do with breaking with old habits of thinking**\n\nturn the slip-box into a tool for breaking out of our own thinking habits.\n\n**To see things as they really are is the ability of experts**\n\nMake sure that you really see what you think you see and describe it as plainly and factually as possible. Double-check if necessary. That this isn’t as obvious as it sounds will become clearer by the fact that the ability to truly see what is in front of one’s eyes is often listed as a trait of experts. And that is easily explained by the fact that our perception does not follow the order of seeing first and interpreting second. It does both at the same time: We always perceive something as something – our interpretation is instantaneous.\n\n**To see things as they really are, we need to constantly revised our first interpretation**\n\nTo really understand a text is therefore a constant revision of our first interpretation. We have to train ourselves to get used to seeing this difference and to hold back our ingrained urge to jump to conclusions. To be able to see what we see instead of what we expect to see is indeed a skill in itself\n\n**Always ask what is not in the picture**\n\nWhile the constant comparison of notes can help us to detect differences, no technique can help us see what is missing. But we can make it a habit to always ask what is not in the picture, but could be relevant.\n\n**It is very good to know what has already proven to not work if we try to come up with new ideas that do work**\n\n**Before solving a problem, try redefining it first**\n\nProblems rarely get solved directly, anyway. Most often, the crucial step forward is to redefine the problem in such a way that an already existing solution can be employed. The first question should always be directed towards the question itself: What kind of answer can you expect from asking a question in this particular way? What is missing?\n\n**Using the slip-box trains important intellectual skills deliberately**\n\nBy using the slip-box on a daily basis, we train these important intellectual skills deliberately: We check if what we understood from a text is really in the text by having our understanding in written form in front of our eyes. We learn to focus on the gist of an idea by restricting ourselves in terms of space. We can make it a habit to always think about what is missing when we write down our own ideas. And we can practice asking good questions when we sort our notes into the slip-box and connect them with other notes.\n\n**Restrict yourself to one idea per Tala**\n\nI highly recommend treating a digital note as if the space were limited. By restricting ourselves to one format, we also restrict ourselves to just one idea per note and force ourselves to be as precise and brief as possible. The restriction to one idea per note is also the precondition to recombine them freely later.\n\nEach note should fit onto the screen and there should be no need of scrolling.\n\n**A lack of structure and restriction is the biggest threat to creativity and scientific progress**\n\nThe biggest threat to creativity and scientific progress is therefore the opposite: a lack of structure and restrictions. Without structure, we cannot differentiate, compare or experiment with ideas. Without restrictions, we would never be forced to make the decision on what is worth pursuing and what is not. Indifference is the worst environment for insight.\n\n**Outlining reveals the gaps in your argument**\n\noutline your argument and construct a preliminary order of sections, chapters or paragraphs. This will make questions, which are not answered, obvious, and it will show the gaps in the argument that need to be filled and make visible which parts still need some work.\n\n**Writing is narrowing down**\n\nit is now about narrowing the perspective, making a decision on one topic only and cutting out everything that does not directly contribute to the development of the text and support the main argument.\n\nwe have so much at hand that we have to curb our impulse to mention everything at the same time.\n\n**Testing students for memorized knowledge is futile**\n\nthe fixation of our educational system to learn things by heart – which means to think without external tools. Testing students for memorised knowledge does not give much indication about their understanding\n\n**The brain prioritizes recent, emotional, and concrete information over abstract, vague, and emotionally neutral**\n\nthe brain prioritises ideas that are easily available in the moment. This, obviously, does not equal relevant. The brain more easily remembers information that it encountered recently, which has emotions attached to it and is lively, concrete or specific.\n\nEverything that is rather abstract, vague, emotionally neutral or does not even sound good is far down on its list of priorities – not exactly the best criteria for an intellectual endeavour.\n\n**We tend to like our first ideas the best irrespective of their actual relevance**\n\n**The slip-box decetralizes thinking**\n\nThe slip-box does not put the learner in the centre. Quite the contrary: It allows the learner to let his or her own thinking become decentralised within a network of other ideas.\n\n**Learning, thinking, and writing should be about personal development**\n\nLearning, thinking and writing should not be about accumulating knowledge, but about becoming a different person with a different way of thinking. This is done by questioning one’s own thinking routines in the light of new experiences and facts.\n\n**Unsorted**\n\nIt is such an important skill to see differences between seemingly similar concepts, or connections between seemingly different ideas.\n\n# References\n",

    "content": "\nMy purpose is to live a good life, i.e., to self-actualize and eventually transcend. Fulfilling this purpose involves too much information for my brain to handle. I need a well-thought of tool based on philosophy, psychology, and praxeology to help me keep track of my journey towards fulfilling my purpose. Enter the life management system.\n\n## What is the purpose of the life management system?\n\n[[A life management system should free your mind]]\n\n[[Build a life management system that helps you be at peace with your choices of action]]\n\nA life management system can also be a meaning-making machine. By incorporating journaling and public writing, taking photographs, writing about my days, and reviewing them, I am able to find patterns and narratives that really help me to savor each moment.\n\n# Theory: Understand the concepts behind a life management system\n\n[[thoughts/life management system]]\n\n# Framework: Apply the concepts through a structure\n\nThe framework of my life management system is the structure I follow to implement the insights and lessons I learned from studying the theory behind it. As my understanding of the theory strengthens, so will this framework.\n\nIn building any system or tool, I follow the design principle [[Choose the minimum viable tool or solution first]] before optimizing. I try to solve problems using the least amount of resources to avoid waste.\n\nIntegrating a life management system in my life, involved introducing three things:\n\n- Tools\n- Structures\n- Habits\n\nTools require time and effort to learn. The same can be said with getting used to structures and incorporating habits. If I start by looking for the most optimal tools, structures, and habits to implement, I will be too overwhelmed to start and make progress. It became clear to me early on that it is best to integrate an LMS in my life slowly and with modest goals. I started by building a [[Minimum viable life management system]] then optimized along the way as I got more used to it.\n\n## Ground level: Capture and organize actionable and non-actionable information\n\nThe [[ground level]] captures and organizes [[Loose ends]]. Per [[getting things done]], it is better to start organizing your life by tackling your loose ends first so that you are freed with mental space that you can use to think about your [[00 - A/Sky level]].\n\nHere is [[My LMS ground level setup]].\n\n## Sky level: Get clear about what you want\n\nOnce I had my ground level in place and have acquainted myself to it, I was able to free myself with enough mental space and energy to think about what I really want. This is the best time to think about my motivations and intentions.\n\n1. Write a [[Purpose statement]].\n   - Ideally, this is the first step. However, I found articulating my [[thoughts/purpose]] very tricky and difficult at first as I wasn’t clear about the point and meaning of life. Even if I had enough self-knowledge, answering the question “Why do you live?” was still difficult. I decided to use a temporary purpose and skipped thinking about it altogether and focused on working with my life areas first.\n   - Purpose statement: [[thoughts/my purpose is to live deliberately]].\n1. Do the best future self exercise to create a vision.\n   - [[thoughts/my best future self exercise]]\n1. Write a [[Mission statement]].\n   - [[My mission statement]]\n1. Divide life into life areas.\n   - Life areas are important to make sense of divergent projects ([[Areas are mini life purposes]]).\n   - [[Maslow’s hierarchy of needs can be used as life areas]].\n1. Divide life areas into sub-areas if necessary.\n   - [[Divide areas into sub-areas for easier tracking]]\n1. Set goals for each life area.\n   - Here are my [[Life goals]].\n   - Remember that each goal shall be tied to a project eventually.\n\n## Reviews\n\nAfter setting up a system to organize your actions and a system to organize your areas and goals, it is important to set up systems to look back at your actions and evaluate whether you have succeeded in your aspirations. To maintain awareness of the connection of individual actions with goals and areas, implement a multi-layered review system.\n\n1. Use an [[Annual review]].\n   - The purpose of the annual review is to create a meaningful connection between what you accomplished in your monthly projects and areas, and your Sky level (i.e., purpose, vision, and mission).\n   - I use the annual review to aggregate an annual report, which I use to create new goals and a new vision for the coming year.\n   - I then write an annual review article that I share to the public.\n   - Here is [[My annual review routine]].\n1. Use a [[Monthly review]].\n   - The purpose of the monthly review is to create a meaningful connection between monthly projects and areas as well as your vision for the year.\n   - I use the monthly review to write a monthly report for the month.\n   - I then create a publishable version of this report and share it via Uman.\n   - For the coming month, I review my sky level and choose the goals to tackle and setup project folders and todo lists for each.\n   - Here is [[my monthly review routine]].\n1. Use a [[Weekly review]].\n   - The purpose of the weekly review is to process all accumulated loose ends in all inboxes both actionable and non-actionable and to make sure that projects and tasks are up-to-date.\n   - Here is [[My weekly review routine]].\n1. Use a [[Daily review]].\n   - The purpose of the daily review is to choose and perform actions  for the day from all the options you have articulated.\n   - Here is [[My daily review routine]].\n\n## Project management\n\nAfter choosing the projects I will work on at any given month, project management involves the day-to-day engagement with these projects.\n\nThe questions you need to ask here are:\n\n- What is the kind of work you want to be doing?\n- What are the creative artifacts or end-states you want to produce?\n- What routines and workflows do you have to install to produce those artifacts or end-states?\n- Will you share whatever it is you produce?\n- How often will you share?\n- How do you determine what to share and what to leave out?\n\nIntegrate your sharing process with your review system.\n\n### Workflows\n\n**Individual project workflow**\n\nMy workflow involves working on small projects that are documented then shared.\n\n1. Target a specific area of life.\n2. Set a goal.\n3. Conduct research.\n4. Create a meta-plan.\n5. Apply plan.\n6. Report results via blog and newsetter.\n\n[[My daily routine]]\n\n# Talahardin\n\n***\n\nEvery month, you need to have at least one intellectual project.

    "content": "\nThere is no such thing as a best camera. The best camera is the best for your needs.\n\nHere are the important steps to take before buying a camera.\n\n1. **Define your budget.** Decide whether to get a budget (Php 20-30k), mid-range (Php 30-60k), or high-end (Php 60k+). If you are just starting out, start with a budget model because you don't need that much features and the amount of money you spend on a camera will not make you a better photographer. You are in a budget, buy secondhand then invest in better lenses.\n2. **Choose the type of camera.** Decide whether you want a compact, bridge, DSLR, or mirrorles. The most imortant thing to have is a camera with a manual mode and whose lenses are interchangeable.\n3. **Consider the size of your kit.** The most important factor here is sensor size. Sensor size determines the size of the camera and the accessories that go with it. There are three types of sensors: full frame (35 mm), crop (22 mm), and micro 4:3 (17 mm). The bigger the sensor the more detailed the image, but the bigger the camera and its accesories will be. There are cameras that try to minimize the size of the sensor without compromising its power (e.g. Canon M50).\n4. **Consider image quality.** This is related to the previous point. If you want more detail then you will need a bigger sensor and, therefore, camera and accessories. When you are just starting out, you don't need a large camera.\n5. **Choose the right brand.** Choose a brand that a friend or family is using so that you can ask for their help.\n6. **Consider filming.** If you need to film using your camera, aspire for an ability to shoot in 4k with 60 fps.\n7. **Consider where to buy.** You can buy in person or online. It is best to hold the camera before buying, so go to a shop to hold it even if you are buying online. When you buy secondhand, buy at well-established secondhand companies, look for something with a low shutter count and not thirdhand.\n\n# References\n\nThe School of Photography.

    "content": "\nbe aware of our impulses and committed to countering them.\n\nStart by interrogating your motivations. Pay attention to when you are seeking fame, prestige, envy, or admiration—especially from strangers. Before you post on social media, for example, ask yourself what you hope to achieve with it. Is it truly to amuse or inform others, or share something uplifting? Or are you hoping to inspire a bit of invidious comparison?\n\nSecond, if your motives are more fame-based than you’d like to admit, consider the value that following through would bring relative to the cost.\n\nThe benefit will be the dopamine hit you will get. The cost is in the *reality* of how people will actually see your post (and you): Research shows that people will largely find your boasting to be [annoying](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615573516)—even if you disguise it with a [humblebrag](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28922000/)—and thus admire you less, not more.\n\n“Who knows himself a braggart, / Let him [fear](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear)this, for it will come to pass / that every braggart shall be found an ass.” - Shakespeare\n\nThird, ask yourself whether you really want to base some part of your happiness on the judgment of others, including and especially strangers.\n\nto seek fame per se—to attract attention to yourself as opposed to your work—is to subject yourself emotionally to that scrutiny, which will inevitably end in disaster for your self-esteem.\n\nConnect instead to someone who truly loves you for who you are, not just for the parts you hope someone might admire or envy.\n\nThe right rule of thumb is to treat fame like a dangerous drug: Never seek it for its own sake, teach your kids to avoid it, and shun those who offer it.\n\n## References",

Treat your home, yard, and pet at the same time.\n\nFleas usually target animals first then:\n\n- yard\n- house\n- furniture\n- humans\n\nFleas flourish in warm climates. The ideal temperature range is 80 to 90°F (26 to 32 °C) with 70 percent humidity.\n\nIn these conditions, fleas have a life cycle of 18 to 21 days. If the weather isn’t ideal and there isn’t a host to feed on, flea larvae may remain dormant for months while waiting for better conditions to develop. On average, adult fleas live from several weeks to several months.\n\nYour pets are carriers of mature fleas but the entire house is the nursery.\n\nOnly 5% of the infestation is in your pets.\n\nThe remaining 95% are eggs, larvae, and cocoons around the house\n\nTo truly eradicate the problem, treat your pet and their living environment at the same time.\n\n1. Use a powerful vacuum to clean the house. Dispose the contents without touching them.\n2. Use a steam cleaner that combines heat with soap to kill fleas in all stages. Clean places where you pets lie down.\n3. Wash all beddings in hot water. Dry them at the highest setting.\n4. Use an aerosol spray insecticide with permethrin (for adult fleas) and methoprene or pyriproxyfen (for eggs, larvae, and pupae). Let it dry before reentering.\n\nHow to wash beddings\n\n- For stuff that can be washed in the washing machine, take them straight to the washing machine and wash them with soap and warm water.\n- For mattress, dust the bedding with botanical and boric acid base dust (kills larvae and eggs)\n- Include in the dust a permethrin based pesticide (kills adults)\n- Put the bedding in dryer for half an hour to kill cocoons.\n   - Alternatively: put the bedding in a plastic bag, treat it, wait for a few weeks, move the plastic bag around, then treat it again, then wait for another week.\n\nTo dos\n\n- Buy temporary mat to lie down while cushion dries\n\n## Reference\n\nSullivan, D.

But such software does not exist at the moment. Some solutions around the Internet are Rice Issa's [Spaced Inbox](https://github.com/riceissa/spaced-inbox) and Obsidian's [Spaced Repetition community plugin](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition). Issa's solution seems only applicable for Windows, while Obsidian's plugin requires that all notes to be reviewed are tagged by a specific tag—something that needs to be tediously done to existing notes one-by-one. Also, transporting prompts between Craft and Obsidian creates a lot of unnecessary friction.\n\nI found a more manual solution for implementing this kind of system using a note-writing application that supports interlinking. Cesar Rodriguez [implemented this in Roam](https://cesarr.co/posts/implementing-a-spaced-repetition-writing-system/). I’m implementing it in Craft using a combination of notes, backlinks, Google Calendar, the Mac’s native Calendar app, and Things. For the complete setup see: [[How to setup a spaced repetition writing system in Craft]].\n\nTo implement a spaced repetition writing system, the following general rules should be followed:\n\n- Collect inklings in a single [[writing inbox]].\n- Review each inkling. If the inkling was interesting and you were able to expand it but you need more time, schedule it soon for another review.\n- If the inkling is interesting but is hard to expand, schedule it for a later time.\n- If the inkling is no longer interesting, remove it.\n- If you have developed the inkling into a permanent note, transfer it to your [[Zettelkasten]].\n\nI implement these rules in [[thoughts/my morning writing practice]].\n\n## References\n\nMatuschak, A.

    "content": "\nI am attracted to [[James Clear]]'s minimalist [[goal-setting]] strategy, which applies the [[warren buffet list]]. With some modifications, here is the process I follow for goal-setting.\n\n1. I create a [[My life goals master list]] one time then update yearly. I create it by coming up with a list of my life areas and listing goals under each area.\n2. I review my initial list of goals and look closer at each goal. I ask myself if this  goal require smaller goals to achieve. If yes, I list all of the smaller goals under it.\n3. At the beginning of each year, during my [[Annual review]], I choose my top 5 goals from this master list. These goals will be my primary focus for the year. The rest of the goals will be my [[Avoid-at-all cost life goals]].\n4. I then review my top 5 goals and choose which to work on for January. If I think I can achieve two goals in one month, then I create project notes for each goal. If I can only achieve one, then so be it.\n5. Every month thereafter, during my [[Monthly review]], I review the goal set for the previous month and either mark it as completed, carry it over next month, park it, or delete it.\n6. If the previous goal was completed, I first go to my top 5 goals list and choose a goal from them.\n7. I use the monthly review to update my goals for the month. Only after all my top 5 goals are completed will I create a new top 5 goals, which will be made up of promoted goals from the Avoid-at-all-cost list.\n\nThis process relies on trust that I have made a comprehensive job of creating the master list at the very beginning. The better the master list captures my short-term and long-term goals, the lesser the work I shall do moving forward.\n\n# References\n",

In the first place, **never start a job until you know precisely how you are going to do it. Pass its construction step by step through your mind, so that you may hit upon the snags and mentally smooth them out.**\n\n**Don't work hurriedly.** Your very keenness may prompt you to rush, but to do so is fatal. Curb your desire to see the thing finished, and **always concentrate intently upon the particular bit of the job you have in hand.**\n\n**In all you do be accurate.** No measurement, no cut, no squaring, should be \"near enough.\" It must be right. For often one inaccuracy becomes the seed of others, and reproduces trouble as the work proceeds.\n\nFinally, **don't worry about an honest mistake. Ponder the reason for it and so learn from it. Progress at your own speed from simple job to something more difficult, but never force the pace. At the same time, be just as ambitious as your previous work warrants.**\"\n\n~ Charles Hayward, a cabinet maker and editor of The Woodworker magazine\n\n## References\n\nThe Woodworker",

  "/I-picked-up-a-thrown-kitten": {
    "title": "I picked up a thrown kitten",
    "content": "\nOn September 25, 2022, while Lea and I walked Juan Pancho Street near Forestry at UPLB, we picked up a kitten that was crying loudly. I can still hear her cries. I was the one who first recognized the cry. I even asked where it was coming from. Turns out, we didn't have to look any further. The cry was coming from along the road. We saw the kitten. It was covered with flies. Small yellowish grains, which I now know were fly eggs covered the poor kitten's left ear and legs. They smelled like rotten fish.\n\nThe dilemma that lea and I had to face was whether to take the kitten or not. I asked Lea. I was calculating, thinking about the stress and the time it will take to take care of such a small young creature. And yet Lea was never calculating. She just said we should take the kittenn for it was pitiful. That plain decisive utterance was enough to touch that compassionate part of me that many have not won had Lea not been there with me as I was walking. I didn't think of it this way at that time, but Lea, indeed, knows what is right and wrong intuitively (in her personal moral compass) and love just flows from her sometimes. Nontransactional. No calculations. Just immediate. The gift response.\n\nSo we picked the kitten up. We looked for something to wrap it around. We didn't have any cloth with us, so I removed the kutsinta we bought earlier out of its brown paper bag and put the kitten inside that small bag as I carried it with both of my hands: one hand (the right) holding the kitten's body and the other holding it on its scruff. I had Lea take over the couple fund waller and buy ingredients for our lunch, while I walked directly to the house under the sun to clean the kiten up.\n\nIt was silent for most of the walk home. Perhaps the sunlight was soothing its skin. Back at home, I cleaned it up using some warm water and the scrub with the antibacterial soap. I remembered the dead cat I saw the day before while walking at Melanio A. Gapud and can't help but to think whether that death and this lost kitten were ever connected. The kitten is orange like the dead cat I saw.\n\nAfter bathing the animal, I dried it up using the cats' towel and placed it inside the carrier to rest. I warmed a bottle of water and placed it inside the cage for heat. It immediately got near it and quickly dried its fur. It went to sleep for a long time.\n\nIn the late afternoon, Lea and I bought a nursing bottle (P180) and milk replacement powder (P150). When we got home, we tried feeding it with the bottle to no avail. I think a dropper is the best bet, but since I didn't have one, I used the syringe for now. We fed the cat every three hours using the powdered milk. It was a struggle, but the hesitation I once felt when deciding to pick the kitten up has faded away. I remembered Oreo and Gripo and how I failed them and how I was given the chance to redeem myself and help a soul.\n\nI remembered [[thoughts/henry bugbee]] and the purpose of reflection—to be decisive in one's action at this moment. I remembered [[thich nhat hanh]] and compassion. I remembered [[Walt Whitman]] and his passion in helping the wounded during the war. I felt that this was an opportunity to make someone else's life thrown—literally thrown—become a gift once more. And who would've thought that I will go this far in taking care of one soul? This place transforms people. It has transformed me.\n\nI detailed the fate of this kitten, which I named Keeley in the poem I wrote: [[Today I Buried a Kitten]]\n\n# References",

Emotional is necessary to grapple with subjective reality.\n\nTaken together, both knowledge propel us to take action (i.e., achieve finality).\n\nBoth are ways of relating with the geography.

However, in everyday language, the word “information” is often used as an abstract mass-noun that refers to any amount of data that is sent, received, stored, and manipulated in any medium. Everything we know about the world is based on information.\n\nThere are two main features of information.\n\n1. **Information adds up.** For example, the amount of information in two books is larger than the amount of information in one book.\n2. **Information reduces uncertainty.** The more we get information about something, the more our uncertainty is diminished to the point that it is gone.\n\nTo Do\n\n- Research how the concept of information is related to the theory of forms by Plato.

In these instances, an insight becomes a [[convergence tool]] that unifies all thinking and experiencing that happened before it. Because it is rare and takes time to occur, insights are precious and, therefore, should be captured immediately ([[contacts/rofel brion|rofel brion]] disagrees; he thinks what he is currently doing is more important than insight so he is willing to let go of it if it disrupts his main focus).\n\nWhen insight performs the duty of a convergence tool, it helps us commit, respond, and act.\n\n# References\n\nAhrens, S.

    "title": "Is there really a need for a field called Spirituality?",
    "content": "\nSpirituality is a tricky field. Its language muddles with philosophy, psychology, religion, health, etc. What separates it from all the others? Is there a logical necessity to construct another word such as this?\n\nGiving a name to something means we are claiming that it is “different” from the others. Otherwise, why would we name it in the first place? A name is a differentiator.\n\nDifferentiation, in turn, requires building boundaries. All the other old disciplines have established their boundaries in relation to other disciplines. Reality is far from being bounded, but differentiation is a necessary step in productive thinking. It helps thinkers think and divide the labor.\n\nFor example, psychologists can tackle the issue of consciousness as it relates to human behavior. But at some point, they will stop asking questions about consciousness: What is consciousness? Does it exists? How are we sure? These are questions for philosophers. Interdisciplinary thinking is good and it is encouraged in academic circles. But for a particular field to exist and be recognized, it has to have hard boundaries. These boundaries serve as signals for people who are looking to join the discourse in these fields.\n\nHow do we establish boundaries between fields? Boundaries are established through defining the “problem” or problems that the field attempts to solve. Usually, there is a major problem and a few subproblems related to it. These problems can be expressed through a question or a subject matter. For example, the subject matter of psychology is the experience and behavior of an individual. A question based on this subject matter could be “Why does an individual act the way he does?” On the other hand, philosophy would ask questions like, what is action? What is experience?\n\nIn order for Spirituality to be a field of its own, it has to prove that the problems or questions it is trying to solve are indeed “spiritual” in nature. It has to define what is spiritual and differentiate it from the non-spiritual. This means that its problems and questions should not be psychological, philosophical, or religious. This is problematic because a lot of “spiritual” practices seems to tackle aesthetic, ethical, physical, and psychological problems.\n\nSpirituality can differentiate itself from other disciplines if it can prove the following: Transcendence exists.\n\nAlmost all cultures have an idea of “human flourishing”. This is a turf that psychology has already held. Philosophy can permeate to almost all topics (because it asks questions like “what is it?”).\n\nBut there is another thing that that is independent of human flourishing and seems indispensable: that is transcendence.\n\nThis differentiation between flourishing and transcendence finds the biggest litmus test: fortune (or more accurately, misfortune).\n\nIn reality, there are “large-scale structural defects” or features that we can’t really address. The biggest of these features is misfortune. There are things we just can’t control.\n\nPsychology claims that a human life that has flourished is the most complete form of human life (what Aristotle called eudaimonia). However, even a person who has achieved eudaimonia is not immune from misfortune. This could imply that human flourishing is not the final completion, that there is something beyond it.\n\nPsychologists would argue, using Aristotle’s arguments, that a human being who has flourished will not be deterred by misfortune, as he can integrate the misfortune into his wisdom and continue living. If this problem is easily solved by psychologists then there is no need for spirituality.\n\nBut if there is something beyond this, then spirituality deserves its own conceptual space.\n\nSpirituality does not negate eudaimonia or flourishing but makes a profound inner break from its goals.\n\n# References",

    "title": "'It Is a Serious Thing Just To Be Alive'",
    "content": "![Wild yellow flowers on the field](yellow_flower_field.jpg)\n\nMary Oliver's poem \"Invitation\" will be one of my favorites from her. I enjoy her vivid poems best—those that paint a specific story—but, occasionally, she has these \"preachy\" poems where she presents her general thoughts about life. One of these poems is \"Invitation.\"\n\n\"Invitation\" is a poem about _doing things just for the sake of doing them_. It's a poem about things we love so much that doing them is their own purpose. It's also a poem about \"not doing\"—not doing certain activities for others, not doing certain activities for money, but doing them entirely for oneself and one's own pleasure.\n\nMary Oliver thinks this is a philosophy of living all by itself—a full-blown strategy that could change lives. \"It could mean something. It could mean everything,\" she says.\n\nWhether or not one approaches life in this fashion determines the quality of one's life. I share this belief with her as well as with other thinkers whose works have influenced me like [Charles Eisenstein](https://charleseisenstein.org/) and [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/).\n\nDoing things for the sake of doing them, \"living in the Gift\" (as Eisenstein puts it)—that realm of moneyless generosity—doing nothing, having full creative freedom, not thinking about pleasing other people, or building an audience, not presenting oneself as an unchanging \"brand\" or an eternal identity—all of these remind us of the value of not having anything else, _**other than simply being alive**_.\n\n\"It is a serious thing just to be alive,\" the bard of Provincetown reminded us.\n\nWhile busy striving for goals, we usually forget the immensity of that fact: \"We are alive!\"\n\nIs that by itself not enough?\n\nAll of us need to take the time to sink that fact down our bones. And we need idleness to realize that. It isn't something that can come easily in the middle of a busy schedule. This truth needs room to breathe itself out.\n\nPause. Reflect on it and be grateful for being alive.\n\nDo nothing. Or if that's too hard, do something _without the purpose of building yourself a reputation or a retirement fund._\n\nDo something because it makes your heart sing the sweetest song.\n\nThis is the reason why I believe in hobbies and having idle time. It is also the reason why I do not sell any of my deepest passions. In fact, I have drawn a clear line between _work that earns me money_ and _work that builds my art_. Some people combine the two and it works for them perfectly! Not to me. I enjoy complete creative freedom only when I see clear boundaries. If I don't sell my art, I don't have to compromise with the demands of an audience, a patron, an investor, or a customer. I can do what I do just for myself, freely, with the purest joy. This is what the word \"Gift\" means—that which is free from all the constraints of the money economy and everything attached to it—and that realm is what I want to expand through my creative work.\n\nFor more about the concept of Gift, read _[The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Creativity-Artist-Modern-World-ebook/dp/B002GKGB00/)_ by Lewis Hyde.\n\nYou can read Mary Oliver's brilliant poem, \"Invitation,\" [here](https://wordsfortheyear.com/2017/08/28/invitation-by-mary-oliver/).\n",

I take pleaasure in the sound of his words. I love the rhythm of the language and the simplest images they evoke. There is all of nature: flower, tree, rock, mountain, sunbeam, and then there are the people—father, mother, family, friend, God. Rofel's poems have a purity—even bareness—that almost makes them \"un-poetry.\" They are without affection, without overtly poetic language, and yet intensely personal, often lyrical. His words are solid and heavy in the hand or light to the touch, or salty or sweet on the tongue, and yet also, always, basic and elemental... like water, like earth, like air. The poems are deceptively complex in their simplicity.\n\n\u003eI see his great love for single, singular images and his special affection for certain Tagalog words—*inaakit, tahimik, busilak*.* I feel his steadfast, integral faith, his deep and overwhelming capacity for friendship but also for love. I also sense her loneliness.\n\n### The audience and themes of Rofel's writings\n\n\u003eHis poems are signposts to the kindred, little notes to other friends, to beloved family members, musings and reflections on the spirit and also, quite naturally, prayers.\n\n# References\n\nBrion, R.

    "content": "![Kubo Dark](kubo_dark.jpg)\n\nNaglalakad ako sa harapan ng Bahay ng Alumni sa UP Diliman. Tulad ng ordinaryong pedestrian, sa sidewalk ako tumatapak.\n\nHindi ko maalala kung lalaki siya o babae pero sa sandaling iyon makakasalubong ko siya. Malaki ang aking katawan at malayo palang siya naging malinaw sa'kin na hindi kami magkakasiya sa sidewalk.\n\nHabang unti-unti kaming pinaglalapit ng aming mga yapak, nagsimulang maglaro ang aking isip.\n\n\"Ako ba ang gigilid o bababa sa sidewalk, o aantayin kong siya ang magkusa?\"\n\n\"Kung ako ang bababa o gigilid, bakit ako?\"\n\n\"Kung siya ang bababa o gigilid, bakit siya?\"\n\nUmiikot ang mga katanungang ito sa aking isipan hanggang mapagtanto kong lumagpas na pala ang tao. Tumingin ako sa aking mga paa. Nasa sidewalk parin ako at hindi rin ako gumilid.\n\nDito dumating sa akin ang musa.\n\nSa sandaling magkakasalubong kami ng tao, may kani-kaniya kaming patutunguhan—ako'y pauwi ng bahay, siya'y maaring papunta sa shopping center. Subalit upang makarating sa kani-kaniyang patutunguhan, mayroon kaming komun na pangangailangan: isang malalakaran. Nagkataong sa kalagayang ito, ang bagay na tingin nami'y kailangan namin (ang sidewalk) ay hindi sapat para sa'ming dalawa.\n\nSa puntong magkakasalubong kami, may dalawang maaring mangyari:\n\n1. Igiit ng bawat isa na siya ang may karapatang maglakad sa makitid na sidewalk, at magaway kami, o\n2. Magparaya ang isa at ipaubaya nalang ang sidewalk, at maiiwasan ang gulo.\n\nPinili ng taong nakasalubong ko ang pangalawa at pareho kaming nakarating sa kani-kaniyang patutunguhan ng mapayapa.\n\nPatuloy na naglaro sa aking isipan ang nangyari hanggang makita ko ang pagkakatulad nito sa mas malawak na mundo ng ekonomiya—isang mundo kung saan pinaghahati-hatian ng marami ang iilang yaman.\n\n## Mula sa Sidewalk Tungo sa Ekonomiya\n\nTayo rin ay mistulang naglalakad patungo sa anumang tingin nati'y magdudulot ng kaligayahan at kaginhawaan. Sa ating paglalakbay patungo roon, mayroon tayong mga \"pangangailangan\" (need). Upang matugunan ang mga ito naghahanap tayo ng \"daan\" (means) na \"sasapat\" (satisfy) sa kanila.\n\nSubalit madalas, ang napipili nating \"daan\" upang matugunan ang ating pangangailangan ay siya ring \"daan\" na napili ng iba. Ang daang ito ay isa ring uri ng pangangailangan—isang \"yaman\" (resource). Tulad ng anumang uri ng \"yaman,\" madalas ito rin ay \"may hangganan\" (finite, limited) kaya hindi lahat ng nagnanais na gamitin ito ay makakagamit.\n\nMay makakagamit at may hindi makakagamit. May mapagbibigyan at may magpaparaya.\n\nAng hindi pagtanggap at paggalang sa payak na katotohanang ito ang humahantong sa maraming hindi pagkakaunawaan, gulo, karahasan, at digmaan. Iniisip ng marami sa atin na:\n\n- A1: Tunay na kailangang-kailangan ko ang \"yaman.\"\n- A2: Ako ang may karapatan sa \"yaman.\"\n- A3: At dahil ako ang may karapatan sa \"yaman,\" siya ang dapat magpaubaya upang ako ay mapagbigyan.\n\nSa tingin ko maraming gulo at karahasan ang maiiwasan kung maiisip lang natin na:\n\n- B1: Baka hindi ko naman talaga kailangan ang \"yaman.\"\n- B2: At dahil hindi ko naman talaga kailangan ang \"yaman\" baka maari kong isantabi na lamang ang anumang karapatan kong gamitin ito.\n- B3: At kapag naisantabi ko na ang aking karapatan, baka naman handa na akong ipaubaya na lamang ang \"yaman\" sa iba.\n\nWala akong ibang nakikitang kahahantungan ng ganitong uri ng pag-iisip kundi \"kapayapaan\" (peace).\n\nSubalit pansinin na hindi maaring maisip ng isa ang B2 at B3 kung hindi niya lubos na tinatanggap ang B1—ang posibilidad na baka hindi naman talaga niya kailangan ang bagay na akala niya'y kailangan niya.\n\nDito papasok ang kosepto ng \"sapat\" (enough) na pagtugon sa ating mga pangangailangan.\n\n## Ano ang \"Sapat\"?\n\nMasasabi nating natutugunan ang ating mga pangangailangan ng \"sapat\" kung ang \"dami\" (amount) ng yamang tumutugon rito ay:\n\n1. Hindi kulang, at\n2. Hindi labis.\n\nKung ako'y nagugutom, \"sapat\" ang aking kinain kung:\n\n1. Nabusog ako (at hindi \"nagugutom parin\"), pero\n2. Hindi ako \"bloated.\"\n\nTantuhin na parehong hindi kaiga-gaya ang resulta kapag kulang at kapag labis ang pagtugon sa isang pangangailangan.\n\n\u003e Ang \"sapat\" na \"pagsapat\" sa ating mga pangangailangan ang siyang tunay na pugad ng kaligayahan at kaginhawaan.\n\nTandaan rin na ang \"sapat\" na pagtugon sa ating pangangailan ay nangangahulugan na \"may eksaktong dami ang kasapatan.\"\n\nKung tatlong saging ang \"sasapat,\" hindi dalawa o apat ang \"sapat.\"\n\nKung isang-libong piso ang \"sasapat,\" hindi limang-daang piso o dalawang-libong piso ang \"sapat.\"\n\nAng \"sapat\" ay may eksaktong bilang.\n\nMagkakaiba tayo ng pangangailan at dami ng pangangailan kaya magkakaiba rin tayo ng \"kasapatan\". Subalit, kung sasadyain nating isipin, malalaman natin nang may _buong katapatan_ kung ano talaga ang sapat sa atin.\n\nBagaman magkakaiba tayo, may mga pagkakatulad sa ating mga pangangailangan bilang tao. At ang simpleng pagbubulay-bulay ay magpapakita na may iilang payak na pangangailangan lang naman talaga tayo. Patuloy tayong mabubuhay at maaari pa tayong mangarap kahit mas kaunti ang \"yaman\" na ginagamit natin kumpara sa akala natin dati.\n\n## Ang \"Pagpapaubaya\" ay Nagdudulot ng Kapayapaan\n\nKapag alam natin kung ano ang \"sapat,\" alam natin kung ano ang kailangan natin at ang hindi natin kailangan (kapwa ang anyo at dami nito). Sa mga bagay na kailangan natin, kumilos tayo upang masapatan sila. Kapag nakuha natin ang \"sapat\" na \"yaman\" sa tamang paraan, mayroon tayong karapatan na protektahan ito.\n\nSubalit, sa mga bagay na hindi naman talaga natin kailangan, mga bagay na kapag hindi natin nakuha ay hindi naman magsasapanganib sa ating buhay, maiiwasan ang gulo o karahasan kung isusuko na lamang natin ang anumang paghahabol rito.\n\nKung hindi mo kailangan, hindi mo kailangang makipag-away para rito.\n\nKung hindi mo kailangan, ibigay mo na lamang sa iba.\n\nAng pagtanto ng kung ano ang \"sapat\" para sa atin ay nagbubunga ng pagkahandang magpaubaya. Ang \"pagpapaubaya\" ay nangangahulugang ng mapagpakumbabang pagsuko mo ng anumang akala mo ay kailangan mo dahil nakita mong hindi mo pala _talaga_ ito kailangan.\n\nAng \"pagpapaubaya\" ay nagdudulot ng \"kapayapaan.\" At lahat ng ito ay posible dahil nalaman mo kung ano ang tunay na \"sapat\" para sa'yo.\n",

  "/Kasaysayan-ng-pakikipagkaibigan-ko-kay-Rem": {
    "title": "Kasaysayan ng Pakikipagkaibigan ko kay Rem",
    "content": "\nKamakailan lang natapos kong basahin ang librong *The Gift* ni Lewis Hyde, isa sa mga napakaraming librong matagal na hinanap ni Rem sa ilang Booksale branches na madalas niyang dalawin pati sa mga online bookshops sa Facebook. Magkasabay naming binili ang kopya namin nito dahil saktong nagrelease ang isang online bookshop ng dalawang kopya at kami ang unang nag-dibs. \"Kapag bumibili ka ng libro, parati kang bumili ng dalawa,\" turo niya sakin. Bilang isang minimalist, may resistance ako sa advice niyang ito (among many other beliefs niya na niresist ko). Ayokong magimbak ng libro at magkaroon ng library tulad niya lalo't nakita ko kung paano niya pagsakitan ng ulo ang pagaayos ng kwarto niya at panlumuhan ang mga libro niyang kinain ng anay.\n\nNgayon, ngayon na nakikita ko ang lahat ng buhay na nahawakan ni Rem, ang richness ng community niya, nauunawaan ko na ang wisdom ng turo niyang iyon. Bumili ka ng dalawang kopya ng libro, dahil ang isa ipangreregalo mo.\n\nKay Rem, lahat ay tungkol sa kapwa. Lahat ay tungkol sa iba. Ayaw niya ng may napang-iiwanan. Galit siya sa mga tao at institusiyong gusto sila sila lang. Pangarap ni Rem na lahat ng uri ng tao matutunang tumula, mabigyang boses. Ang vision ni Rem ay cultural transformation na nagsisimula at nakalapat sa tao. Yun ang ilang beses niyang sinabi sa akin, kay Claire, at malamang sa mga pinakamalalapit na kaibigan niya. Isang purpose na  na-articulate lamang niya nitong mga huling taon ng kaniyang buhay. Pero sa apat na pung taon na naglakad siya sa mundo, kahit hindi pa niya nauunawaan kung bakit nandito siya, lahat ng ginawa niya gaano man kaliit ay papunta sa mithiing iyo. One relationship at a time. Maski sa pinaka-selfish moments niya, moments na kinailangan niyang mag-isa at lumayo sa iba, iniisip niya tayo, tayong mga mahal niya at nagmahal sa kaniya. Pati sila na hindi pa niya nakikilala at natututunang mahalin.\n\nKahit kailan man hindi ko nasabi kay Rem na secretly tinatawag ko siyang matalik na kaibigan. Hindi ko kailan man ginamit ang mga salitang yun sa kaniya although nasabi ko sa kaniya minsan na pagkatapos ni Lea, siya ang pinakanapagbuhusan ko lahat, kinoconsider ko ang relationship ko sa kaniya bilang pinakamature at developed. Hindi ko rin narinig sa kaniyang tawagin akong matalik na kaibigan. Pero paminsan-minsan nararamdaman ko yun. Paminsan-minsan nararamdaman kong may mga bagay na sa akin lang nya nasasabi. Hindi ko alam kung paraan niya yon ng pagpaparamdam sa akin kung gaano ako kahalaga sa kaniya o sadyang tumatakbo lamang siya sa akin, sabik, minsan desperado na may makinig sa kaniya. Dahil kahit gaano siya ka-superhero sa harap ng publiko, minsan pati sa akin, nakita ko si Rem na katulad nating lahat, nakikipagbuno sa kaniyang nakaraan, sa kaniyang pakiramdam, sa kaniyang mga insecurities, sa mga regrets, sa mga planong hindi alam kung kelan darating. Isa sa mga regrets ko sa pagkawala niya ay ang hindi man lang pagclarify kung ano ba talaga kami sa isa't-isa. Rem, ano ba talaga ang status natin?\n\nNagsimula ko siyang makilala noong ako'y lumong-lumo, nag-iisa noong 2017. Limang taon bago noon, noong 2012, iniwan ko ang kinagisnan kong religion, along with that my entire community. Hindi na ako naniniwala sa inyo. Bahala kayo diyan. Makahahanap ako ng bagong community mag-isa.\n\nLimang taon pagkatapos kong umalis ng relihiyon, madalas pa rin akong naglalakad mag-isa. Ang girlfriend ko noon, na nakilala rin ni Rem, asa QC, ilang milya ang layo sa akin sa Pangasinan at nakatira pa rin ako sa mga magulang ko, na mas naging aktibo sa simbahan.\n\nLumong-lumo ako noon. Nag-iisa. Nagdadalawang isip sa ginawa kong desisyon.\n\nNoong 2016, a year before kong makilala si Rem, narealize ko na bagaman hindi na ako nagreresonate sa fundamentalist evangelical Christianity, palatanong pa rin ako sa malalalim na mga tanong tungkol sa buhay at existence, at may malalim pa rin akong sensibilidad sa kahulughan ng buhay. Intention ko noong 2016 na maghanap ng \"spiritual\" community. Nag-aral akong mag-yoga at nagretreat sa Palaui. Nag-Zen meditation ako at ilang beses nagsesshin sa Baguio. Lahat nang mga karanasang ito ay nakatulong para makilala ko ng higit ang aking sarili, pero hindi nila napuno ang puwang na iniwan ng pag-alis ko ng dati kong simbahan - ang puwang ng tunay na pagkakaibigan na ang depenisyon namin ni Rem ay kapag nagkarinigan at amuyan na ng utot, yun na yun.\n\nSa taong yun, 2016, habang naghahanap pa rin ng mga spiritual-oriented communities, nabasa ko ang isang article sa Rappler. Ang pamagat ng article na yun ay \"Ginhawa: Wellness for the Filipino Soul\" isinulat ng isang Claire Madarang. Hindi ko pa noon alam pero ito ang magdadala sa akin sa bago kong komunidad at magpapakilala sa akin sa mga taong tatawagin kong pinakamalalapit kong kaibigan.\n\nMula sa article ni Claire, nakilala ko ang Ginhawa at noong February 2017 umattend ako ng kauna-unahan kong Ginhawa retreat. Doon ko unang nakilala si Rem. Magaan ang loob ko kaagad sa kaniya. Doon ko una siyang natunghayang magbasa ng I-Ching, magfacilitate, at sumayaw. Punong-puno ng buhay si Rem maski noon pa. Pero ang pinakafond memory ko sa kaniya noon ay ang madatnang natutulog siya sa loob ng men's dorm sa pinakamalayong kama tanghaling tapat habang ang lahat ay busy sa labas na nagwoworkshop. Later ko lang nalaman na trademark pala talaga niyang matulog at unfortunately parating sa mga Ginhawa events ito nangyayari. Naaalala ko pa, pinagmasdan ko siya noon. Humihilik. Sa sandaling yun, doon ako nagdecide. Ah, kakaibiganin ko tong taong ito.\n\nAt kinaibigan ko nga talaga siya.\n\nNagkita kami muli ni Rem sa Rumi event na inarrange ni Ime at kung saan siya ay isa sa mga nagbasa ng tula ni Rumi. Ang pakilala sa kaniya ay isa siyang Love Teacher. Pagakyat niya sa stage kaagad siya nagbiro, \"Maski ako rin po naguguluhan sa ibig sabihin ng Love Teacher. Kung may tanong po kayo pag-usapan po natin mamaya.\" Siguro nagkaroon siya ng mga bagong kliyente pagkatapos magbiro.\n\nMula doon, ininvite ako ni Rem sa FLOW kung saan talaga nabuo ang pagkakaibigan namin. (Find details). Ininvite ko siyang magparticipate sa ebook project ko at pumayag siya.\n\nKasama ko si Rem sa mga pinakamahihirap na pagsubok na pinagdaanan ko. Noong dumaan ako sa break up ng 6-year relationship ko, siya ang isa sa dalawang kaibigan na araw-araw ko halos kausap para makamove on. At noong nagsimula na akong magdate muli at makilala si Lea, siya rin ang isa sa pinaka-unang nakaalam ng mga impressions ko sa bago kong ka-date. Dahil taga QC si Lea at Pangasinan naman ako, nakilitulog ako kina Rem sa Batangas right after ng dates namin. Maganda ba? Kumusta siya? Ang mga unang tanong ni Rem sakin. Sa pagdalaw-dalaw kong yon sa Batangas naging kaibigan ko rin ang mga kapatid, mga pinsan, at nanay ni Rem. Naka-ilang kain din ako sa mga birthday nila. Miss ko na po ang pancit niyo Tita Kora. Ang ma-embed sa pamilya ng kaibigan ko ang isa sa pinakasatisfying na karanasan na ipinaramdam ni Rem sakin.\n\n---\nPandemic days\n- Tungko\n\nLB days\n- Bahay-bahayan\n- LPH\n- Satya\n- Inner circle\n\nMga regrets\n\nMga mamimiss ko\n- Ang mahahabang kuwentuhan natin sa balkonahe niyo na ineextend pa natin maski sa kama pag matutulog na\n- Ang paglolomi natin magkasama\n- Ang mga favorite mong linya: major, for some reason, tuloy daloy, and I thank you\n- Pero higit sa lahat mamimiss kong pisilin ang utong mo\n\nPaalam kapatid. Paalam. Paalam. Paalam.\n\n---\n\nRem's hardships and insecurities.\n\nIsa sa mga privilege na maging malapit na kaibigan ni Rem ay ang makita ng malapitan ang mga struggles at insecurities niya. \n\nNapakagaling na makata ni Rem, at may malalim na understanding sa Filipino. Pero still insecure siya sa pagtula to the point na ilang taon niyang iniwan ito.\n\nAt hindi lamang ang pagtula ang iniwan ni Rem. Marami siyang sinimulan, sinubukan, at iniwan. Tulad nating lahat nageeksperimento, naghahanap sa ano mang wala.\n\nNoong makilala ko siya mula 2017-2019, nasa gitna siya noon ng pagpproseso: ano ba talaga ang kailangan kong gawin? Sabay dito ang struggles niya sa pagsupport sa art niya.\n\nMahirap siyang makita na nasa ganoong kalagayan.\n\nKaya naman lahat kami ay lubhang naging sobrang saya na itong mga huling taon ng buhay niya ay ang pinaka-puno, pinaka-vibrant na parte ng creative life niya. Mula sa hindi ko alam kung ano ba talaga ang gagawin ko, una kong narinig kay Rem na, \"This teaching poetry, I could do this forever.\" Nahanap ni Rem kung ano ba talaga ang nagsusustain sa kaniya at nagfully commit siya doon. Pagkatapos ng ilang taong paglalakad sa ilang natagpuan ni Rem ang tahanan niya at doon nagsimula siyang bumuo ng balon, balon na siyang iigiban ng marami sa atin dito.\n\nSa lahat ng ginawa ni Rem, ang Tungkomunidad ang pinakamamahal niya, ang pinaka-proud siya.\n\nTungko\n\nThe seeds of formalizing his ideas on poetry began in our conversations in his balcony. I dont have proof to this other than memory. But I would wager that he has proof. Because he records everything. The evidence is in his phone. Our convos are all there, unless he transferred it to his laptop.\n\nLong before there was Tungko, Rem and I conceptualized what we then called Ginhawa Poetics.\n\nI was actually hesitant about a curriculum. I secretly disagree to some of what he teaches at Tungko. But this was understandable. I am an agnostic with deep \"spiritual and religious\" sensibilities. I scoff at talks on energy, crystals, prayers, angels, longdistance healing, etc. Even if I ponder on deep existential questions. On the other hand, Rem is so open. He accepts almost everything, allows everything to flow to him to the point that it was ok for him that he contradicted himself.\n\nI kept my disagreements secret most of the time. But Sometimes not so secretly. I have copies of our long conversations thru chat, with me posing questions and challenging him. He would not respond thru chat. He is a poet and a lazy writer after all so he would record his answers. I rebutted his answers. We only stop when he stops responding. Thats when I know  nasaid ko na patience ng kaibigan ko.\n\nBut no matter our differences, I felt something when I saw Rem blossom into a leader, a teacher a poet. thru Rem I learned that no matter how u disagree with someone you can still feel extreme joy with his wins, support him, and celebrate with him, cheer him on so he can continue. Because at the end of the day, it is his wellbeing, his health, his happiness that you are most interrsted in, devoted in, not his religious beliefs.\n\nRem taught me faith. Faith not on an invisible power but on humanity, our ability to coexist and thrivr not despite but because of our differences. My relationship relationship with R relationship was proof that a world of tolerance is possible, something I believe he also aspires to in his work.\n\nThe first public fruiti\n\nKung may magtatanong sa akin kailangan mo ang kidney ko hindi ako magdadalawang isip na ibigay ito. In fact, hindi ako magdadalawang isip na ibigay ang buhay ko para sayo.\n\nReturn to your messages. Seek what Rem was troubled about.\n\nWho was Rem?\n- he loves to flow and yet he cannot create without structures. Weeks and even weeks could pass without him doing anytjhing just because his books were eaten by termites and he hasnt fixed them yet.\n- He calls himself introverted and he does have moments long stretches of times when he wants to be alone. And yet he energizes himself by people.\n- He said that when he doesnt conduct Tungko, he feels troubled. He needs to do his work be ause it makes him sane.\n- He is esoteric. He believes in miracles, powers of prayers, and yet he also professes in science. Med rep ako bago ako naspiritual2 sabi niya sakin minsan.\n\nRem had demons\n- he talked about experiencing abuse when he was you g\n- He had insecurities to his writing\n- He secretly envied me because I finish reading books while he struggles to start the large library he has accumulated.\n- He feels he cant do philosophy and analyze and that he is just a poet (only to realize this year that he was very interrsted in doing research). He jumped into Zettelkasten.\n\nNo matter how imperfect our friendship, there is one fact I am super proud of about my relationship with him, something I couldnt say even with my relationship with Lea. Ni minsan hindi kami nagkaroon ng tampuhan o sagutan. Kung nagtampo man kami sa isat isa, madali naming nakalimutan yun dahil mas mahalaga sa amin kung anong meron kami.\n\nI dont know if anyone could replace rem. I will try to move on and continue looking for a place to call my home. I will never leave Claire and all the friends I made thru Rem, including his family, which I had the privilege of meeting and bonding with.\n\nBut no one can fill up Rem and I am ok with that. No one should be able to.\n\nRem was a prophet, a seer, or even, dare I say, a mystic. Because he saw things, and he believes that everyone of us can see things. Everyone can write. Everyone can be a poet. He doesn't have to but he has a strong desire to prophesy, much like Whitman and Thoreau felt. He would say, it is changing now. Things are changing now.\n\n\n\n\n\nSobrang daming tulang binasa ni Rem sakin pero pinakapaborito ko ang pinakauna niyang tulang narinig ko. Binasa niya ito nang hindi sinasabing sinulat niya ito. Sabihin nating yun ang initiation ko sa poetry. Bagaman nagsusulat ako ng lyrics sa banda noong high school, at minsan nagpadaloy ng tula habang nasa himpapawif ng Cotabato, hindi ako mahilig magbasa ng tula.\n\nPero nang marinig ko ang tulang ito, napukaw ako:\n\n(Read kapayapaan)\n\nSabi ni Lewis Hyde sa libro niyang gift, malalaman mo kung gaano ka kalapit sa isang tao kung gaano ka kahesitant idonate ang kidney mo pag kailangan na niya. Si tita cora hindi yan magaatubili. Mga kapitd ni Rem hindi rin. Lalo na si Claire. Ako? Hindi rin.\n\nI never really felt that Rem depended on me. Maybe he tried to depend on me but I failed him or I rejected his offer. But me I depended on him a lot. I exploited Rem!\n\nKapag hindi ako naghohold ng poetry class Vince, kapag hindi ako nagtutungko, I feel so",

And I look around me and I see too much emphasis in doing art to change the world, to make a decent living, to inspire others, to save culture, to elevate culture, to gain respect and attention and recognition from others. I see this and I feel like there is too much outward thinking in art.\n\nAnd I wonder how many of us are still truly looking inwards. Are we still using art as a tool for self-renewal? Or are we sacrificing our well-being and the well-being of those intimately around us for the sake of it? Have we become kinder people because of art or have we sacrificed our responsibility to be good towards others just to create great work?\n\nI think about these questions and I direct them inwards and I remember that even if I feel like I am the best version of myself when I am creating art, I find it easy to neglect the dirty, messy work I need to do within to be truly better towards others - confronting traumas, speaking kinder, cultivating patience - for the sake of art. These are skills that have to be mastered to thrive in the art of living and are not necessarily in the vicinity of art. Time is needed to cultivate them. Time and dedication that we discriminatingly give to doing work, to creating, feeling that artistic prowess is more important than any of these. But is it really?\n\nI feel like the world is already saturated with artists and it doesn't really need more. What it needs now is more kind people, more patient people, more mindful people, more honest people, more loving people.\n\nAnd if there is anything truly worthwhile about art, I think, it is that it should help not prevent us to become any of these.",

No need to spell them out. I believe that if, at the end of it all, according to our abilities, we have done something to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try. I didn’t always know this, and am happy I lived long enough to find it out.\n\nRoger Ebert\n\n## References",

    "content": "\nKissa by Kissa is not a page-turner. It elicits the same feeling I get when reading [[thoughts/craig mod]]'s newsletter, which I have adopted in [[Lilim]] and [[Uman]], primarily because of the use of photos as breaks to texts. There are no captions in these photos. They speak for themselves, although many of these photos have subjects that are talked about by the nearby text.\n\nKissa by Kissa has a larger narrative, which could be connected to another larger narrative once Craig finishes his series of books on walking Japan. One gets this narrative in the foreword: Craig's history of being adopted, relocating to Japan, his intention for doing the walk, why kissas, and why pizza toast. With that out of the way, the book is all but a collection of vignettes, shorter than those in [[desert solitaire — abbey]]. Most of these vigettes are about the kissas that he discovered along his long walk. In these vignettes, the interplay between [[Thought and experience]], between being and meaning-making, are once again highlighted. This long walk narrated in the book may have simply been scratching an itch to do something interesting, but it is his interpretation of the walk that shows his growth as a person.\n\nWhat is perhaps most interesting for me is Craig's clear articulation of his purpose for walking. It seems like his decision to learn more about kissas and pizza toast arose organically: adoption -\u003e relocation to Japan -\u003e finding safe have in kissas -\u003e pizza toast as comfort food. This makes me ask myself: Am I forcing walking too much? How can I make my motivation to walk similarly organic? Furthermore, is there a piece of material culture I could latch into and explore in my walks, my very own kissas and pizza toast? Right now, that only thing that feels organic is feeling good when near water or being in nature, walking in silence. In some way, my walks are still a way to get away from depression. My walks are connected to philosophy and deep thinking. They are more in the tradition of Thoreau and the philosophers who walked rather than anthropological research in the case of Craig.\n\nOne wild idea is to create a geography of silence, a map of places that remain free for anyone who deisire self-renewal.\n\n# References\n\nMod, C.

    "content": "\nHuli ko siyang nakasama October 15, 2022, Sabado, halos eksaktong isang linggo bago niya tayo lahat iniwan. Dumalo kami sa book launch ng pinakabagong libro ni Rofel Brion, ang tanging buhay na Pilipinong makata na kinoconsider ni Rem na beacon ng istilo ng tula na gusto niyang isulat at ituro. Tinanong ko siya nun kung i-eextend sa Tungko ang invitation to participate sa book launch. Pakiramdam ko kasi may ilang ka-Tungko na matutuwang makasama. Sinabi niya wag muna, gusto ko tayo-tayo lang muna. Naintindihan ko ang pasya niyang iyon. Nitong ilang linggo bago niya tayo iniwan, nasa malalim na introvert mode si Rem, dahilan kung bakit hindi rin namin siya makasamang ipagdiwang ang birthday niya. Tutok siya sa pag-aaral ng Yi-Ching na kinoconsider niyang parang Biblia. Asa sarili niyang seminaryo si Rem. May nilulutong kung ano. Sa event, pinakinggan ko lang siyang magkuwento kung paano niya nakikita ang mga hexagram symbols sa paligid niya. Nasa kakaibang mode siya noong gabing yun. Hindi ko siya maabot.\n\nHindi nakasama si Claire dahil nasa Las Piñas pa. Si Lea, muntik ng sumama, pero nagdecline siya last minute. Ang ending ay isa muli sa napakaraming date nights ko with Rem. Diko lubos akalaing, yun na rin ang huli.\n\nGusto kong isipin na binigay sakin ng sansinukob ang huling ala-ala ko kay Rem na kaming dalawa lang talaga, kaming dalawa lang, tulad kung paano nabuo ang pagkakaibigan namin simula 2017, na lumalim sa halos mala 2-3 day retreats na pagtulog ko sa bahay nila, mga araw na puno ng tula, pilosopiya, and believe it or not, ireverrent humor.\n\nSaksi kayong lahat sa kung papaano maki-pagkaibigan si Rem. Makikilala ka niya sa context ng grupo. Pero makikilala mo siya sa context ng individual. Kayong dalawa lang muna, tao sa tao. Hindi political thinker si Rem. Pero kung meron siyang istilo ng pagkamit ng pagbabago, ito yun. At pagbabago talaga ang pinaka-vision niya. Cultural change. I want cultural change. Ang sagot niya noong tinanong ko kung ano ang overarching purpose o theme ng lahat ng ginagawa niya.\n\nNoong gabi ng October 15, 2022, maaari na sanang sumakay si Rem mula San Pablo hanggang Santo Tomas. Mas malapit na ang byahe niya doon. Pero pinili ni Rem sumabay sa akin pauwi ng Los Baños. Diretso akong Calamba; magdadalawang sakay nalang ako ang sabi niya. Kapag gumagawa ng ganitong desisyon si Rem, ibig sabihin hindi pa siya tapos sa'yo.\n\nSa jeep, tuloy ang diskusyon sa literatura, ang comparison ng Los Baños sa San Pablo, at plano sa Tungko, lalo na't nakilala namin ang may-ari ng Casa San Pablo na zen practitioner at manunulat rin na may hangarin ding aligned sa Tungko ni Rem. Lumalim ang kuwentuhan, nagfflow si Rem, kaya nagtanong siya, gutom ka pa ba? Gusto mong magpancit sa Agapita? Ikaw, pwede naman, ang sagot ko. Manga alas diyes na yun, mag aalas onse. Nasa kakaibang mode si Rem at may nakilala kaming mga bagong kaibigang aligned sa vision niya. Ako na malapitang natunghayan ang transformation niya mula sa pagiging isang insecure at unsure na makata patungo sa isang taong nag-fully commit sa poetry at nagturo pa nito sa napakarami, naramdaman ko na ang gabing iyon ay mitsya ng isang bagong simula sa buhay niya bilang poet at poetry teacher.\n\nNoong naramdaman naming malapit na akong bumaba sa crossing papuntang UP college, ako naman ang nagtanong kay Rem, ano bababa ka pa? Nanahimik siya sandali tapos sumagot, hindi na Vince, para makapagpahinga ka na rin. Noong nagsisimula kami, hindi ganoon ka-aware si Rem sa need ko for rest. Pero malayo na ang narating namin kahit mag-aanim na taon lang ang pagkakaibigan namin. May respeto na kami sa boundaries at preferences ng bawat-isa kahit hindi kami parating nagkakasundo.\n\nBumaba ako ng crossing, at sinabi ko sa kaniya magkita tayo kaagad soon, ituloy natin to.\n\nSana bumaba nalang si Rem noon. Sana naglakad pa kami papuntang pancitan. Sana umorder ng sotanghon o lomi at nagpaumaga na para sa isang huling bahaginan.\n\nKung bumaba kami noon sa crossing at kumain ng mainit na lomi o sotanghon sa pancitan, at alam kong yun na ang huling gabing makikita ko siya, may tatlo akong sasabihin sa kaniya:\n\n1. Una, tatawagin ko siyang bestfriend, matalik na kaibigan. Kasi never kong nasabi sa kaniya yun personally. Pareho kami na hindi magaling sa paglalagay ng labels sa relationships. Hindi ko kailan man ginamit ang mga salitang yun sa kaniya in person although nasabi ko sa kaniya dati na pagkatapos ni Lea, siya ang pinakamalapit na tao sa akin due to the fact na ang relationship ko sa kaniya tulad ng relationship ko kay Lea ay sobrang daming liko. Hindi madali noong una, dahil sa mga pagkakaiba namin, pero nai-raos namin yun at kung meron akong iisang bagay na pinagmamalaki sa relationship ko with Rem ay yun yung fact na ni minsan hindi kami nagkaroon ng, to use his term, \"major\" na tampuhan o away. Chill lang si Rem. Marunong makiramdam. Marunong maki-ayon. Aware sa pagkukulang niya at kailangan niyang baguhin. In short, madaling maging kaibigan. Hindi ko rin narinig sa kaniyang tawagin akong matalik na kaibigan. Pero paminsan-minsan nararamdaman ko yun. Paminsan-minsan nararamdaman kong may mga bagay na sa akin lang nya nasasabi. Hindi ko alam kung paraan niya yon ng pagpaparamdam sa akin kung gaano ako kahalaga sa kaniya o sadyang tumatakbo lamang siya sa akin, sabik, minsan desperado na may makinig sa kaniya. Dahil kahit gaano siya ka-superhero sa harap ng publiko, minsan pati sa akin, nakita ko si Rem na katulad nating lahat, nakikipagbuno sa kaniyang nakaraan, sa kaniyang pakiramdam, sa kaniyang mga insecurities, sa mga regrets, sa mga planong hindi alam kung kelan darating. Isa sa mga regrets ko sa pagkawala niya ay ang hindi man lang pagclarify kung ano ba talaga kami sa isa't-isa. Rem, ano ba talaga ang status natin?\n2. Sasabihin ko sa kaniya na ang pinakamalaking regalo niya sa akin, at marahil sa inyo ring lahat, ay ang community. Nakilala ko si Rem noong 2017, mag-isa at sabik sa kasama. Through him, nakilala ko ang ilang communities kung saan ko makikilala ang ilan sa kinoconsider ko ngayon na matatalik na kaibigan. Ngayon habang nagbbrowse ng posts sa Remembering Rem group at ng mga larawan ni Rem kasama ng napakaraming kaibigan at handful of groups, malinaw na malinaw sa akin, umapaw ang regalo ng pagkakaibigan kay Rem at dumaloy patungo sa akin, sa ating lahat, dahil punong-puno siya nito. At lahat ng iyon nagsimula sa pamilya niya, sa tahanan kung saan siya lumaki, sa mga kapatid at pinsan niya na nagkaroon ako ng privilege na makilala. Tinuturing ko itong regalo dahil binigay ito ni Rem sa akin ng hindi ko hinihingi at minsan niresist ko pa nga. Pero ngayon na wala na siya sa tabi ko, nararamdaman kong kailangan kong yakapin at tanggapin ang walang-katumbas na regalong ito.\n3. Sasabihin ko sa kaniya na ang pinakamalaking lesson na natutunan ko sa kaniya ay tolerance. May nagtanong dati Vince bakit ka nasa spiritual circles kung agnostic ka naman? Hindi ko pa alam nun ang sagot. Pero ngayon alam ko na. Si Rem ang dahilan. Si Rem ang nagintroduce sa akin sa kaniyang spiritual circles. At bagaman hindi ako nagreresonate sa mga ito, I choose to stay around dahil extension sila ng pakikipagkaibigan ko kay Rem. Ni minsan hindi ako hinusgahan ni Rem sa hindi ko paniniwala sa kaniya. Bukas siya sa dialogue, sa disagreements, kahit nararamdaman ko minsan na uncomfortable siya na chinachallenge ko sya, hindi siya nagagalit. Nakikinig siya. Parati siyang nakikinig. At dahil dito naging matibay ang relationship namin. May mga topics na dati iniiwasan namin pero nitong mga nakaraang taon at buwan bago siya mawala, nasimulan na naming tahakin. Through my relationship with him, naappreciate ko ang intricacy ng dialogue, ng religious tolerance, ng open-mindedness, at higit sa lahat compassion. Dahil nagkakaiba man tayo sa paniniwala kung ano ang umiiral, pare-pareho tayong nangangailangan ng pagmamahal.\n\nSana sapat ang isa o dalawang oras sa pancitan para sabihin ko itong lahat sa kaniya.\n\nAt bago ko siya tuluyang pasakayin sa tricycle na maghahatid sa kaniya sa Olivarez kung saan siya sasakay pa-Calamba, sasabihin ko sa kaniya na mahal na mahal ko siya at gusto ko pa siyang kilalanin, tulungan sa vision niya, maging patient sa kaniya, at magtampisaw sa kaniyang mga tula. Dahil kahit matalik na kaibigan ang turing ko sa kaniya, napakarami ko pang hindi alam tungkol sa kaniya. Napakarami pa.",

    "title": "LPR Causes, Symptoms and Treatment",
    "content": "\n# LPR: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment\n\nLPR which stands for Laryngopharyngeal Reflux or as it’s sometimes known as silent reflux is a condition where acid comes up from the stomach and burns/damages the throat. There are a host of symptoms, but the **main issues revolve around problems with the throat.**\n\nThere are a selection of different things that can cause LPR. Also because of this there are a selection of ways to **solve the problem depending on the root cause.**\n\n## LPR Causes\n\n## \\#1 Weak Sphincters\n\n### Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES)\n\nThe sphincter that most likely will be the one causing you the problem is called the Lower Esophageal Sphincter or LES for short. This sphincter is directly above the stomach and opens and closes as food passes through from the esophagus. The problem occurs when the LES is weak or relaxed when it should be closed and tight.\n\nThis causes the stomach acid to reflux up into the esophagus which then ends up reaching the throat where the main problems of LPR arise.\n\nUnlike most muscles in the body the LES doesn’t get stronger with more usage but in fact gets weaker.\n\nThings like overeating and eating shortly before bedtime put more pressure on the LES and this can cause the problem over years of constant overworking the LES.\n\n### How to Fix a Malfunctioning LES\n\nDiet\n\nThe best way to treat a malfunctioning LES is by changing your diet. There are a host of foods which are known to make the LES weaker which in turn will make you reflux more not because of more acid but because of the LES being open when it shouldn’t be.\n\n**The common foods that you should be trying to avoid are drinks with caffeine particularly coffee and soft drinks, chocolate, fatty foods (fried foods, cream, ice cream, bacon etc). Coffee and chocolate both contain methylxanthine which makes muscles relax more and this in turn can affect the LES and lower the pressure in the stomach. Also foods that are high in fat have shown to take longer to digest and take longer for the stomach to empty.** This means more acid in the stomach for longer which will make the LES work for longer and harder which we want to avoid. The LES is not like a traditional muscle that strengthens when it’s used more – it needs the time to be worked less in order to properly heal and return to its normal function.\n\n**Also avoiding foods and drinks that are highly acidic would be advised. Things you should avoid – alcohol, citrus fruits, tomatoes, mint and all carbonated drinks.**\n\n**If you are prone to eating big meals this puts more pressure on the LES because the stomach becomes more full or overloaded and at some point, will struggle to keep the food and acid inside the stomach because of the stomach being too full.**\n\n**So therefore, eating smaller sized meals with about the amount of food the size of your fist would be more appropriate. You can still eat as much as you normally would, but it is better to split amongst more smaller meals instead of few larger meals.**\n\nSurgery\n\nThe second option is surgery and should only be considered among people who have tried all other options. There are a selection of different options available but 3 of the more notable and successful options are called Nissen, Linx and Stretta.\n\nMedication\n\nBaclofen\n\nMelatonin\n\n### Upper Esophageal Sphincter (UES)\n\nThe UES is the sphincter between the throat and the esophagus. When it comes to reflux it is the last barrier before the acid gets to the throat. The problem with the UES is that is really isn’t there to prevent against acid reflux and often won’t offer much of a barrier as you would like.\n\nTechnically speaking if the UES doesn’t stop the acid then you will develop LPR symptoms. The LES and the esophagus are made to tolerate high levels of acid whereas the UES typically doesn’t fair as well when acid stomach comes its way.\n\n### How to Fix a Malfunctioning UES\n\nThe best way to help the UES is by following a lower acid diet, avoiding acidic foods like I mentioned in the diet section in the LES part above. When you avoid these foods, this will allow the UES to heal and recover and should in turn help it come back to its normal function.\n\n### Pyloric Sphincter\n\nThe final Sphincter is the Pyloric sphincter. It is the Sphincter between the stomach and the intestines. Once food has been digested it will pass through it into the intestines. When a Pyloric sphincter doesn’t function correctly bile which is usually found in the small intestine can end up passing up through the stomach and then giving reflux symptoms and LPR symptoms. This is called bile reflux.\n\nIt can also have the affect that if the Pyloric sphincter is stronger than the LES and the pressure is building in the stomach one sphincter has to give and that usually happens to be the LES – when that happens you get the reflux effect.\n\n### How to Fix a Malfunctioning Pyloric Sphincter\n\nTypically, the same things that will benefit a LES will also benefit a Pyloric sphincter. Physicians and doctors will often prescribe a PPI and it can help though I would personally recommend following my diet advice the same as for the LES instead.\n\n## \\#2 Too Much Acid\n\nFor some people they may get some benefit from taking these tablets but often this effect will not last for long. For most people especially, people will LPR they often won’t get any benefit. The reason for this is because these tablets don’t tackle the problem directly. This doesn’t stop the LES from opening and you from refluxing. While the acidity in the stomach may be lower from taking these tablets it just isn’t targeting the main problem which is pepsin which I will cover in the following section about treating pepsin.\n\nThere have been studies done to test the effectiveness of PPI’s for treating LPR which ended up showing that **PPI’s offer no benefit to someone with LPR.**\n\n## *Be wary of a doctor or physician that prescribes PPI’s for LPR*\n\nThis is something I want to personally highlight because I myself took doctors advice for taking PPI’s for LPR. I took them for 2-3 years with little to no benefit. Almost all doctors and even so-called specialists in the gastro area all would prescribe PPIs, if that didn’t work which happened for me again and again they would try another variant or up the dosage.\n\nThe reason for me pointing this out is that *most medical experts simply don’t know or have the knowledge about LPR and they will often treat it as if it where* [*GERD*](https://www.wipeoutreflux.com/acid-reflux-ultimate-guide/)*.* This treatment is completely wrong, and I would proceed with caution when taking advice from someone who prescribes them so readily to you.\n\nPart of the problem with this is that LPR is a somewhat new problem that has only come around in recent years. The second problem being it is often overlooked and treated as if it where traditional heartburn or GERD as I mentioned.\n\n### Rebound effect of PPI’s\n\nThere is a good chance some of you are currently taking PPI’s with little to no success for LPR. **While I would advise you to stop taking PPI’s** **you must taper of them slowly.**\n\n**If you are currently taking them with no benefit I would advise to taper of them slowly. For example, I would take 2 20mg tablets a day for a total of 40mg per day. I would want to lower to 30mg per day 20mg in the morning and then 10mg in the evening both before meals. I would do that for maybe 1-2 weeks then continue to lower it to 10mg \u0026 10mg per day and then finally 10mg per day. If you aren’t able to get tablets in a lower dose, I would recommend splitting the tablets yourself.**\n\n**If you do plan on doing this I would highly recommend doing this alongside my treatment advice below in this guide.**\n\n## \\#3 Treating Pepsin\n\nPepsin is one of the digestive enzymes that the stomach produces and is used primarily to help break down proteins. After research from some experts in the field it has shown that people with LPR have this pepsin present in the throat area whereas with a typical person this pepsin is not present. The clear problem with this is that pepsin is used to digest proteins so when it comes in contact with the throat it basically tries to digest it. This is where you will usually get the problematic symptoms from.\n\n**The thing with pepsin is that is only becomes activated when in contact with something acidic. This is because its meant to be in the stomach and when acid is produced to help with digestion it will become activated which is exactly the point of it being there.**\n\nThough with somewhat limited research it has been shown pepsin can lay dormant in cells for 1-2 days’ time so if you refluxed the day before then ate something that was acidic the acidity of the food merely passing over the pepsin that was in the throat before would reactivate it and give you your LPR symptoms even if you never refluxed.\n\n### How to Treat Pepsin Through Diet and Things to Avoid\n\n### Diet\n\nThe best way to treat pepsin is to simply lower the acid of the foods \u0026 drinks you consume. Foods that are lower in acidic level activate the pepsin less if not at all which then will lower and vastly help your symptoms. It’s clear that pepsin reactivates mostly from foods and drinks with a pH of 5 or less. **If you lower the intake of foods/drinks like this, it will also stop the pepsin becoming reactivated and will therefore heal and help your symptoms. It should also help with the direct reflux because of the lower acid intake so its sort of a 2 in one if you follow this diet.**\n\nSome quick tips about food choice for this diet –\n\n**Drink only water ( most other drinks such as soft drinks and alcohol are highly acidic )**\n\n**Eat a diet with as little processed food as possible**\n\n**Avoid most fruits ( bananas and melon are an exception and can be eaten )**\n\n**Avoid spicy food**\n\n**Avoid most condiments (high in preservatives and things like vinegar which will irritate the throat further)**\n\n**Avoid tomatoes, raw onions**\n\n**Avoid fatty foods or foods deep fried**\n\n**Avoid chocolate**\n\n### Alkaline Water\n\nWater that you usually drink would typically be around the pH of 7 or about neutral on the pH scale. Alkaline water is water with a pH of higher than 7. *Water with a pH of 8 or above has been shown in* [*studies*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22844861)*to deactivate pepsin, so when you drink it, it should help deactivate pepsin in the throat that it comes in contact with.*\n\nThere are a few ways you can get alkaline water with a pH of 8 or higher. **The best way is to get water that comes from the source and has the higher pH of 8 or more. Options** [*like these*](https://amzn.to/2Hf0zCt)*would be the best and most natural choice.*\n\n**If you are doing this step alone without following the diet you still likely will be reactivating the pepsin so I would only advise to do it if you follow the diet alongside it. In that way you will get the biggest benefit possible.**\n\n**The 3rd option is to add baking soda to your water. You simply mix it up with your water to make it more alkaline.** This is clearly the worst option because of the amount of baking soda you would be consuming but it should be okay for short term usage.\n\n**Using a digital one will give you a very accurate reading, so you know you are getting the right level that you want. This meter can also be useful for measuring the pH of other foods and liquids if you plan on following the diet of 5 pH or higher as you can then test the pH of things if you are unsure.**\n\n## \\#4 Too Little Acid\n\nThe answer being that there is no evidence and research to support that low stomach acid causes LPR and from people’s experiences for the most part this seems to be the case mostly. Though there are a few rare exceptions where it has helped people through taking a supplement called betaine hydrochloric acid (HCL), this is the acid the stomach uses to break down food and when you take it you are basically supplementing the acid in your stomach.\n\nThough keep in mind for most people with LPR this won’t be the right option, but I wanted to make you mindful of it.\n\n## \\#5 Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)\n\nThere is little to no research done to show if there is a direct correlation with LPR and SIBO, though from my own knowledge and research it’s unlikely this will be your main cause though there is definitely a chance it could be. If you find yourself burping a lot or have IBS alongside your LPR symptoms, then considering SIBO could be worth your while.\n\n## LPR Symptoms\n\n**Sore throat**\n\n**Need to clear throat** – if you feel the need to constantly clear the throat try to stop doing that, when you do it constantly throughout the day it can irritate the throat further, *instead of clearing try to take a sip of water or* [*these lozenges*](https://amzn.to/2NmsO6V)*.* Once you start to do it less often you will slowly stop doing it over time. It will help the throat heal faster along with my other treatment advice.\n\n**Excess mucus in throat** – The excess mucus is often because of the throat trying to protect and heal itself and is totally natural. Try to sip water when needed or [lozenges like these](https://amzn.to/2KZAur9) to keep the throat clear.\n\n**Chronic cough** – Just like with the need to clear the throat you might find yourself coughing frequently, try to not cough as much as it can further irritate the throat from doing it frequently.\n\n**Lump in throat feeling**\n\n**Hard to swallow**\n\n**Sore to talk**\n\n**Post nasal drip**\n\n*Breathing problems /* [*Sinus Congestion*](https://www.wipeoutreflux.com/acid-reflux-and-sinus-congestion/)\n\n**Hoarseness**\n\n**Dry throat (read advice below)**\n\n[Ear pain](https://www.wipeoutreflux.com/acid-reflux-ear-pain/)\n\n### Advice for Throat Relief\n\nAs I have mentioned drinking water and taking [these lozenges](https://amzn.to/2KZAur9) are good options for some relief. **A couple more options I would recommend are teas, the 2 options that follow all the guidelines are** [*chamomile tea*](https://amzn.to/2L3vK3O) *and the other being* [*marshmallow root tea*](https://amzn.to/2z7NwhZ)*.*\n\n## LPR Treatment\n\nWhen it comes to curing LPR naturally it definitely is possible for a lot of people and usually the natural path is the best and fastest option for healing. The first 2 recommendations are what I would advise you get started with as soon as possible. After the first 2 options I have listed a host of other things that can also help you even further!\n\n### [Gaviscon Advance (UK version)](https://amzn.to/2WZUFhK)\n\nGaviscon advance is a great thing that will definitely help reduce your LPR symptoms and while it won’t fix the root cause of the problem it will help give you relief while you work on solving the actual root cause. The second important part of my advice is to follow a diet alongside taking the Gaviscon advance, the diet would be aimed at tackling the root cause while Gaviscon will help your symptoms and should aid healing as well.\n\nThe important thing to note when buying Gaviscon Advance is that you buy the UK version. Unlike the US version the UK version has different ingredients and most importantly the **has the ingredient (sodium) alginate. Alginate is something that is extracted from seaweed. The thing with alginate is that it produces a foam on top on your stomach contents which helps create a barrier like effect which helps prevent against reflux. This foam is also great for filtering things like pepsin and bile which I have talked about earlier in this article and are some of the main causes for LPR.**\n\n**The best way to take Gaviscon Advance is 30 minutes after meals as this is when the stomach enzymes and digestion are most active. You can take it before bedtime as well if needed.**\n\nLPR Diet\n\nAnother essential thing I recommend for treating LPR is changing your diet. Firstly, I recommend avoiding a selection of foods and drinks to get started –\n\n**Drink only water (soda, alcohol \u0026 coffee can all make LPR worse)**\n\n**Avoid all spicy foods**\n\n**Avoid peppers, tomatoes, raw onions**\n\n**Avoid fatty and deep-fried foods**\n\n**Avoid processed foods as much as possible**\n\n**Avoid citrus fruits (bananas and melon are allowed fruits)**\n\n**Avoid chocolate**\n\n**Avoid caffeine**\n\nGeneral Tips to help LPR\n\n**Losing Weight**\n\nSomeone who is overweight is more prone to LPR. If you have more body fat around the stomach area this causes there to be more pressure on the LES which often means more likelihood of reflux and LPR.\n\n**Using a Wedge Pillow When Sleeping**\n\n**Lowering Stress**\n\nDoing meditation daily could help with this, also drinking [chamomile tea](https://amzn.to/2HefbCc) which helps with relaxation could be a good idea.\n\nThe best way to help with worry and general stress is to have a overall mindset change. For me personally after reading this book called – “ [How to Stop Worrying and Start Living](https://amzn.to/2NBsoXk) ”, it really helped changed my mindset and definitely helped with my nervous tendencies and overall mentality.\n\n",

In the morning, I pay attention to my thoughts and develop them through writing in my [[Diary]] and [[Talahardin]]. In the afternoon, I go outdoors and develop savoring and paying attention by mindful walking and photography.\n\nTake note: You don't have to pay attention to everything. You just have to be absolutely paying attention as best as you can. This is related to [[you cannot save everyone]]\n\n# References\n\nMod, C.

    "title": "All Them Dirt Roads",
    "content": "\n![The dirt road in Botao](lilim/images/026/dirt-road-botao.jpg)\n\nAre we going to lose another dirt road? It looks like it. Not a single tree was left standing on what used to be a heavily canopied path. It took me so long before giving this trail a try. But when I did, I found the solitude I was looking for.\n\nThe path was less used than the dirt road that led to it—the dirt road that connected Carusocan and Botao, two remote barangays of Sta. Barbara, Pangasinan.\n\nThe Botao–Carusocan road is too narrow. Two motorcycles would fit on it, but not two tricycles. When a tricycle comes, I get out of the way, carrying my bike and standing on the grass below the road. Today, no tricycle passed by.\n\nThis dirt road is not entirely made of dirt. Half of it was already cemented, which means it will only be a matter of time before its other half follows. In the rural Philippines, builders intermittently concretize roads—this segment for this year; that segment for next year. Occasionally, it could take up to six years before an entire route is fully concretized; that is because we have to wait for the next elections to elect the leaders who would hopefully finish the project. I find this waiting period blissful and sad at the same time. Blissful for the few more chances to feel the dirt on my feet. Sad because time is running out.\n\n![An old irrigation lock](lilim/images/026/old-irrigation-lock.jpg)\n\nThe canopied dirt road is not as busy as the Botao–Carusocan road. Almost no one uses it. I once thought it was just a short road that ended at someone’s house. When I finally walked it, I was surprised to discover that it was twice as long as the Botao–Carusocan road. I walked it intermittently at first, cautiously, fearing where it really led because it was not on the map.\n\nOne afternoon, I left my bike at my parents’ house and decided to walk all of it. I started around 3:00 in the afternoon with a backpack that carried my umbrella, a water bottle, and some money. The dirt road led to some houses, some wide pasture lands, and at the end of it was a Catholic walking garden—stations of the cross—which made me surprisingly happy. Again, none of these were indicated in Google Maps. Only locals knew about this road. But that will soon end.\n\nAs I walk it again today, now with my bike trailing beside me, I see iron structures lying on the corner of the fields, lower than the trail. Someone has parked a Hitachi excavator at the tip of the trail's second segment. It has already flattened both parts of the road. They are obviously going to cement the path and turn it into a farm-to-market road. The irrigation canal will be next. For farmers, it is about time. For walkers like me, so long to you, friend.\n\nAs I walk, I see a massacre of trees, some probably 10–15 years old. On top of one cadaver, a pied fantail perches. I walk past it. It senses me and flies low over the short grass. Nearby, a devil's needle dragonfly hovers over what little water is left on the canal. Summer must have been tough. Will the devil’s needle bring the trees' souls to the afterlife?\n\n![A Hitachi excavator](lilim/images/026/hitachi.jpg)\n\nWhen you clear a piece of land covered with trees in the province, you will find underneath them what they have covered their entire life—sachets, diapers, and oxidizing plastics. With them, the fallen trees—their roots, twigs, branches, leaves—are all just garbage polluting the land. As I look at this mess, someone starts singing Masdan Mo Ang Kapaligiran on the karaoke.\n\nI look in front of me, and I see some cows grazing on dry grass. Nearby, goats are eating fresh grass. Above me, a kite hovers—a black kite, almost like a lawin. Beneath, some young boys are running around. One of them was just standing, pulling the kite as he stared at it above.\n\nI continued walking while looking down at the stones, dust, and soil left on this dirt road. These will all be gone soon. Memories came my way—memories of all them dirt roads I walked before. I remembered my favorite dirt road in Sta. Maria, the snake road﻿. I remembered how I spent its last days, how I grieved as I witnessed people flocking spots where I once lied down under the stars, Tiktoking on points where I birthed some poems﻿.\n\nNot long after that road was concretized, I left Sta. Maria for Los Baños.\n\nThe pied fantail is back. It now perched on a branch of a small tree that was spared. It ruffles its tail with that delicate motion I find fascinating.\n\nI stop walking. A poem is coming my way.\n\n![Vines on the back of a house](lilim/images/026/vines-on-house.jpg)\n",

    "content": "\n# Name\n\n- Lilim\n\n# Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this weekly newsletter is to become a reportage of what is currently happening in my “personal development” path, which encompasses my intellectual life, my artistic life, my finances, health, relationships, etc.\n\nIdeally, what I should be able create through Lilim is a feedback loop where [[thoughts/understanding]] informs [[thoughts/living]], which informs [[Sharing]], which hopefully improves [[thoughts/living]].\n\nSince the newsletter is also published in the blog, it reinforces the [[VinceImbat.com Meta-Plan]].\n\n# Topic\n\n- The topic of the newsletter has to be open enough to accomodate my many idiosyncracies. This has to be done so that I can keep writing it. I need to cast a wide enough net (not too narrow, not too wide)\n- Originally, I thought about Lilim as a newsletter about the philosophy, art, and the outdoors. Now I feel like I need a newsletter that simply accomodates everything I’m interested in.\n\n# Format\n\nThe format should be doable in one week. It is simple enough (not too simple, not too complex). It doesn’t have to be a long essay. It has to reflect what happened in my life outdoors and inside my mind philosophizing in the past week.\n\nThe format will be:\n\n- a photo I recently took\n- an insight I am thinking about recently\n- a description of something from my life (a conversation, an anecdote, a memory)\n- a weekly summary to track your journey.\n- some external quote or research\n- The over all goal should be that I am able to weave nature, philosophy, my life, and the world of ideas into one beautiful piece of writing while at the same time recapping the previous advetures in the inner world and outer world in the past week.\n\nPublish long essays on your most important topivs when you are ready.\n\n# Schedule\n\n- Weekly on Sunday\n- Do one weekly newsletter first (then expand from there)\n- To be able to perform Lilim as a weekly review of my adventures in the inner and outer world, I need to have at least one good weekend day to dedicate to it. My rule then is I won’t join gatherings two days in a row in the weekends.\n\n# Workflow\n\nFrom Monday to Friday, I perform [[My daily routine]], which is made up primarily of contemplating, journaling, reading, processing notes, and walking.\n\nI will dedicate at least one day in the weekend (either Saturday or Sunday) to:\n\n1. Write a [[Weekly summary]] of my weekly adventures in the inner world.\n2. Write a newsletter issue that reflects what is in the summary.\n\nIn general, the workflow I follow is study-apply-report. I get good at studying, I get good at applying, and I get good at sharing. Then I use the different areas of my life as topics for study and optimization.\n\n# Audience\n\n- Build a subscriber base by inviting people first. This is very, very important. Apply Dan Blank's advice.\n\nPeople to invite\n\n- Doc Ofel\n- Kerwin\n- Velle Almazar\n- Jed Gregorio\n- Christian Tablazon\n- Rosa Mirasol\n- Diwa Malaya\n- Froilan Medina\n- Bevs\n\n# Daily Commitments\n\nThis weekly practice will dictate what I need to do every day of the week\n\n- Practice photography (walk outdoors, take photos, learn photography, learn editing).\n- Write daily (5MJ, Diary, Talakahon).\n- Read well (regular and selectively).\n\n# References\n",

    "title": "Liminality",
    "content": "\nThe concept of liminality emerged during the 20th century through works written in three disciplines: ethnography, architecture, and cultural anthropology. In all of these disciplines, liminality was defined as a state of being in-between. Arnold van Gennep first used the word in the book \"Les Rites de Passage\" (1908) to describe the second phase of a three-phased structure of rites: separation, transition, and reincorporation. For Gennep, an individual voluntarily launches themself into a disoriented state of liminality to transcend their former identity. In the 1950s, the concept entered architercture through the work of Aldo van Eyck, who expressed it through the geometry of circles and rectangles. The cultural anthropologist Victor Turner reintroduced liminality to anthropology in the 1974 essay, \"Liminal to Liminoid, in Play, Flow, and Ritual,\" where he described it as a psychosocial state subjectively experienced and expressed by an individual.\n\n## References\n\nAl Shrbaji, S. (2020). On walking in derelict urban spaces: Experiencing liminality in a city. _A Obra Nasce: Revista de Arquitetura e Urbanismo Da Universidade Fernando Pessoa_, _14_, 73–83.\n\n\u003eLiminality, as a term, was coined in a dismantled timeline during the 20th century, by an ethnographer (Arnold van Gennep), an architect (Aldo van Eyck), and a cultural anthropologist (Victor Turner). All of whom described liminality as being a state of in-betweenness.\n\n\u003eliminality contains polysemic and polyvalent effects, meaning it shape-shifts according to its referral, it became a non-structural structuralist term.\n\n\u003ethe neologism of liminality came with the ethnographer Arnold van Gennep’s “Les Rites de Passage” (1908)\n\u003e\n\u003eVan Gennep drew the attention to liminality, as a new abbreviated form of an individual ́s deliberate and voluntary transition into a disoriented, intermediate state – through time amidst a ritual. This transitioning is rendered in a three-fold sequential structure. The structure synthesizes a three-phased order of rites, into which an individual – from any existing culture – transcends. From the liminal (transition) and what comes prior and after transcending into it, to a context, to a city, and then to a border, the order of phases emphasizes an in-betweenness performed within this procession.\n\n\u003eVictor Turner, a cultural anthropologist, on the other hand, reintroduced liminality into anthropology in his essay, “Liminal to Liminoid, in Play, Flow, and Ritual” (1974). Turner stressed on the semantic part, which engages with the psychological state and behaviour of an individual, during the transitional phase. By that, he relatively suggests the existence of an anti-structure, which circles back to the non-structural- ity of liminality, making both terms alternatively associated.\n\u003e\n\u003eliminality embodies a system that could be adequately linked to dissimilar, cohesive or conflicted, sources – ideas, meanings, movements, aspects, or systems.\n\u003e\n\u003e“inbetween realm, which forms a third place, or threshold, that links as it separates two previously opposed conditions.” (Coleman, 2005, p.202)\n\nGennep, A., Vizedom, M., and Caffee G.

Open Court.\n\n\u003eall rites of transition are marked by three phases: separation, margin (or limen), and aggregation. The first phase of separation comprises symbolic behaviour signifying the detachment of the individual or group either from an earlier fixed point in the social structure or a set of cultural conditions during the intervening liminal period, the state of the ritual subject is ambiguous; he [sic] passes through a realm that has few or none of the attributes of the past or coming state; in the third phase the passage is consummated (Turner, 1987, p. 47).\n\n",

Constraints are what allows creativity and often becomes the asset of a creative work. This was the case with Noelle's translations. Because she was not a poet nor a learned Filipino writer and speaker she embraced literalness as a guiding principle in her work.\n\nShe followed Ted Hughes' advice:\n\u003eThe first ideal is literalness, insofar as the original is what we are curious about. The very oddity and struggling dumbness of word-for-word versions is what makes our own imaginations jump. The only justification, it would seem to us, for anything but the most literal of translations is (i) in those cases where the original poetry somehow makes an original and interesting poet of the translator who is not otherwise a poet and (ii) when the translator already is an interesting and orignal poet in his own right and in his version, we are glad to see more of him...\n\nAccording to Hughes, a word-for-word translation of poems best suits translators who are not poets and whose first language is not English.\n\nNoelle took three months of translating which involves going back and forth to the original poems, the original translations, and her own.\n\nThis is how she describes her process:\n\u003eI returned to a number of poems the way a mother returns to her kitchen because she thinks she's forgotten to turn off a burner. I switched and changed; I tinkered and fiddled, and then, unexpectedly, a day or two later, I would go right back to my first impulse.\n\n\n# References\n\nBrion, R. G.

But you have to use these first walks to find support and feedback to strengthen your home base. The more you strengthen your home base, the more you become capable of going out. The process is not linear; it is cyclo-linear. You stay at home to tend to your house but you go out regularly to expand and connect with others and the world.

For walkers like me, so long.\n\nAs I walked with my bike trailing beside me, I saw a massacre of trees, some 10-15 years old. On top of one cadaver, a pied fantail perched. I walk pass it, sensed me, and flew low over the short grass. Nearby, a devil's needle hovers over the little water left on the canal. Summer must have been tough. Is it bringing the trees' souls to the afterlife?\n\nIn the province, when you clear a piece of land covered with trees, you will find underneath what they have covered their entire life—sachets, diapes, decomposing plastics. Now they are all together with the fallen trees—all just garbage polluting the land. As I look at all this mess, someone started singing Masdan Mo Ang Kapaligiran on the karaoke.\n\nI looked in front of me and I saw some cows grazing on dry grass. Nearby, goats are eating fresh grass. Above me, a kite hovers—a black kite, almost like a lawin. Beneath, a group of young boys are running around. One of them was just standing, pulling the kite as he stares at it above.\n\nI continued walking and looked down. A poem is coming my way.\n\nTo do\n- Include a reflection on the death of your favorite dirt road in sta maria.",

It is a pattern that we could replicate and which shall continue to exist even if we are all already gone.\n\nBut how all of these are possible is perhaps less important than the experience of love itself. Love and compassion arises from mud like the lotus ([[Understanding leads to compassion]]). They arise even from places where they shouldn't—where hatred and suffering abound. And they move us and those around us—those who experience it from us. They are moved to reciprocate it to us and then to show it to other people in their lives. Love is contagious.\n\nThe greatest example of love involves an acceptance of our mortality for the sake of it. To accept that one could face the end of one's life and of one's [[Ginhawa]] for the sake of showing love to the world—to others (martyrdom!)—is the greatest proof that love is possible. [[Jesus]] was a great example of this. [[Love requires courage]]. Love is ultimately outward bound. Self-love is great. But eventually, love is outward. Love radiates.\n\n## Related\n\n- [[Love thy enemy]]\n- [[Love and Grief]]\n- [[Love requires courage]]",

And give themselves the chance to see the better side of love.\n\nSo love and the ability to grieve are intertwined.

    "content": "\n![Lurem](Lurem.jpg)\n\n_Lurem_ is barely breathing. Her breathing is segmented. One quick out-breath, then a long pause, then another quick out-breath. It is as if she isn’t breathing anything in. She’s just releasing whatever darkness is inside her.\n\nI lay down next to her under the stars. _Laki Dika_ said it will help her. “The light from the forefathers will restore her spirit,” he said. And so I brought her here in the middle of the wide _Laoac na Ansisit_. I carried her here with my own bare shoulders even if she was twice my size, a large young _lobo_ who was once filled with endless vigor.\n\nNow, she barely responds to anything. She only wags her tail whenever I call her name. “_Lurem_, _Lurem_, my love. Get better soon. There are lots of _usa_ to hunt!” She wags her tail upon hearing her name and for a moment I feel her spirit jump. But then she goes back to that deep dark abyss that I can’t seem to fathom.\n\nI feel like she knows she’s done and she won’t be able to hunt _usa_ again.\n\nThe enemy that did this to her was invisible. Even my father, an albularyo na lobo, can’t identify the evil spirit or whatnot that caused her this sickness. “Just bring her to the waters. Let her drink. She needs to drink a lot. It might save her. There’s nothing more we can do if we don’t know who we’re fighting with,” my father said.\n\nWe don’t know who the enemy is. But we do know that something like this was inevitable to happen. _Lurem_ was an entirely different creature, so different from all the other lobos of _Caboloan_. She jumps higher and runs faster than everyone else. When she was born, she immediately stood up on her toes and walked as if she was already walking inside her mother’s womb. She was strong and always happy. But most fascinating of all, she was so curious—excessively curious.\n\nShe would leave the _baley_ sometimes, without me, even for days. At first I was worried that she won’t come back. But she always does. And every time she returns, she would appear with an unusual object, dead animal, or fruit between her large sharp teeth. “She has gone into the _Kabilungetan_,” my mother would say in her distressed voice. “That _lobo_ is so hard-headed!”\n\nThe _Kabilungetan_ is a forbidden place, a place visible from the highest peak of _Palandey Pugaro_. You can see it on the horizon, surrounded by charcoal black soil, dead trees, and rotten prey under heavy, dark clouds that don’t stop looming above it. Many stories about this place haunted my dreams when I was a boy. Everyone was afraid to venture into this frightful of places. But not _Lurem_. _Lurem_ was different from everyone, both _lobo_ and _tao_.\n\nEven _Kabilungetan_ was her playground.\n\nI do not know if there’s anything we could have done to contain such curiosity, such energy, such wildness, such true nature, such life. If it was fate that brought us a _lobo_ who was this spirited to find her demise too soon, what could we have done to oppose fate? No spell could contain _Lurem’s_ energy. She was a free spirit and she followed the fire within her wherever it brought her, no matter the consequences.\n\nAs I lay down right next to her, there under the star-filled sky of the forefathers, I continued listening to the segmented breathing of my young friend. I rested on the calm, serene wave of her spirit, which I have often longed for. I never thought that I would pay a high price to have _Lurem_ be as quiet and calm as a lonely feather.\n\nI touched her fur for the last time. Then I raised my hand and placed it over my heart. I resolved that I will not blame myself for not doing enough to prevent what happened to _Lurem_. I closed my eyes instead and breathed myself, slowly, segmented, so that I may fall asleep, hoping that there, in my sleep, I might see clearly the truth that freedom for each and every creature—_tao_, lobo, _ayep_, _tanaman_—is worth everything, is worth every single pint of life.\n",

    "content": "\n[[Feelings, when involved with universals, can also be philosophical]]\n\n**Wisdom is a thought-feeling.**\n\nI remember here something I read a while back that wisdom is what bridges philosophy and contemplation. Wisdom also seems to bridges thought and action. Actually, to be accurate. Wisdom, being a thought-feeling, bridges thought-feeling and action. We act not just because we think it is the right action, but because we feel so. Often times, we are moved more by our feelings rather than our thoughts.\n\n\u003eThought has neither the wisdom of affective experience nor the affective experience of wisdom.\n\n**We are moved more and spurred to action and change by feelings rather than thoughts**.\n\nThis is related to the fact that people believe on something not because it is right but because it has some benefit to them. Benefits include psychological and emotional benefits.\n\n\u003eFeelings seize, stir, and excite people more than abstract thoughts do, because the former are more deeply related to personality and behavior. Great philosophers—Plato, Kant, Schelling, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Jaspers, Sartre, Berdiaev—experience philosophical feelings and, indeed, philosophical passions that help determine the scope of their minds.\n\u003e\n\u003ewhat matters more is to elaborate philosophical emotions as ways of experiencing the world—and as ways of changing it. Emotions of philosophical cast affect the world more powerfully and directly than do metaphysical ideas and logical propositions. A revolution is driven by philosophical wrath, exasperation with the existing order of things, and the feeling that the world is unjust. Scientific discoveries are impelled by philosophical wonder at the mysteries of the universe. Works of art and technical innovations are propelled by philosophical feelings of excitement, pride, and freedom to transform the world.\n\n**Philosophical thoughts strive for universality.**\n\nFor some support on this, review highlights from the article on Pilosopiyang Filipino.\n\n\u003ePhilosophical thoughts distinguish themselves from nonphilosophical ones by their striving for universality. “John is stupid” is not a philosophical thought, while “humankind is stupid” is one.\n\n**The craft of philosophy is essentially emotional.**\n\n\u003e People sensitive to philosophy experience their attitudes toward the world in general as an emotional drama. They are tormented, exhilarated, amazed by the mysteries of the universe.\n\u003e \n\u003e The aim of philosophy is not so much to change the world (recalling Marx’s eleventh thesis on Feuerbach), or even to explain it, as it is to cultivate the most refined and profound feelings about the world.\n\u003e \n\u003e The power of thinkers is more truly characterized by the depth of their philosophical feelings.\n\n**The feeling of wonder is the source of philosophy.**\n\nWonder, which is felt everyday, when applied to universal subjects, becomes the fuel from which philosophizing becomes possible. Wonder makes us ask and investigate for the root of things. Wonder is the source of metaphysics.\n\nSooner after we start our philosophical journey in wonder do we realize it will also end in wonder. Because philosophy shows that the deepest questions don't have clear answers or have answers as mysteries.\n\n**Wonder produces philosophizing, which in turn produces more wonder.**\n\n\u003e“For it is owing to their wonder that men both now begin to and at first began to philosophize; they wondered originally at the obvious difficulties, then advanced little by little and stated difficulties about the greater matters, e.g. about the phenomena of the moon and those of the sun and of the stars, and about the genesis of the universe. And a man who is puzzled and wonders thinks himself ignorant.” (Aristotle)\n\u003e\n\u003eeveryday wonder is transformed into philosophical wonder—the source of philosophy itself—by its application to the “greater matters” of cosmology and the principles of existence.\n\u003e\n\u003eWonder provokes us to ask questions about the nature of ordinary things and, in doing so, to become absorbed in their causes and, further, in the causes of the causes and then deep into the foundations of all existing phenomena, which is the subject of metaphysics.\n\u003e\n\u003eActually, the purpose of philosophy is not to answer plainly and definitively all our questions but to lead us to the deepest recesses of the unknown and unknowable—from wonder to wonder, from mystery to mystery. Wonder is not only the beginning but also the end of philosophizing: “Two things,” Kant writes, “fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily we reflect on them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.”\n\u003e\n\u003eIt is not just that wonder prompts us toward meditation but also that meditation invokes even greater wonder.\n\n**Examples of philosophical feelings**\n\n\u003ePhilosophical contempt for the shallow circumstances, trifles, and everyday fuss that divert people from “the greater matters”: the search for the meaning of life and the fulfilling of human destiny;\n\u003e\n\u003ePhilosophical wrath against an unjust world order that gives everything to some and nothing to others, that torments the righteous and favors the impious;\n\u003e\n\u003ePhilosophical anxiety over the mind’s inability to see the world as a whole and thereby determine its meaning;\n\u003e\n\u003ePhilosophical fear of Being because it is unknowable, or of non-Being because it is annihilation, or of one’s own insignificance in relation to infinity;\n\u003e\n\u003ePhilosophical sorrow over the knowledge that all things pass, that even the greatest of deeds and people are forgotten\n\u003e\n\u003ePhilosophical tormen\n\n**Universals are general qualities that can either be concepts or feelings.**\n\n\u003eA universal, as I am using the term, is a general concept or a common quality of many phenomena, for example “beauty,” “home,” “number,” and “mind.” However, a universal might also be something that evokes similar feelings, brings about the emotional state of joy or wonder, provokes fear or boredom. “The joyful,” “the boring,” and “the wondrous” are examples of universals graspable by emotions rather than by reason.\n\n**Thinking without feeling**\n\n\u003eThinking without feeling is shallow and becomes tautological. What distinguishes synthetic judgments from analytic ones is a feeling intrinsic to the concepts yet nevertheless not logically deducible from them. Analytic philosophy is devoid of great philosophical feelings, whereas philosophical judgment, when it becomes synthetic (in the Kantian sense), may be based on flights and leaps of feeling.\n\n**Combine emotion and thought to create a lyrical philosophical statement.**\n\n\u003eA feeling and a thought interpenetrate and form a philosophical mind-mood (or call it a senti-mentality).\n\u003e\n\u003e“All the dignity of man consists in thought. Thought is, therefore, by its nature a wonderful and incomparable thing” (Thoughts, fragment 365)—this is an example of a deeply synthetic and emotionally invested judgment.\n\u003e\n\u003eHow can they be reunited? Sometimes passionate meditation is effective, as it was for Augustine, Pascal, Kierkegaard, Dostoyevsky, and Nietzsche, among others.\n\u003e\n\u003eIn general, though, the philosophically significant boundary lies not between thoughts and feelings but between mundane empirical thoughts and feelings, on the one hand, and comprehensive, universal thoughts and feelings, on the other. The genuine vocation of philosophy is to expand the realm of feelings through the generalizing capacity of the reason, so that love, joy, hope, pain, and grief can be experienced in a noble way, on the largest, global scale not reducible to private or practical situations.\n\u003e\n\u003eAt the zenith of such experiences, new feelings emerge for which there are no extant words, whereas in commonplace situations experienced in routine ways, such feelings arise only rarely.\n\u003e\n\u003ePhilosophy needs to take a course on sentimental education to acquire the ability, in the words of Byzantine hesychasts, to “immerse the mind in the heart” (that is, to experience what the mind otherwise merely contemplates). The cultivation of philosophical feelings should become the focus of philosophical education.\n\u003e\n\u003eSo what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. —Saint Paul, First Epistle to the Corinthians 14:15\n\u003e\n\u003eThere occur states of mind when indeed the intellect sings. In such states, a thought becomes rhythmic, self-expressive, and even rapturous, while remaining a thought and thus conveyed through premises, arguments, and conclusions.\n\u003e\n\u003elyric philosophy that therefore requires the expression of direct acts of will in the first-person singular, addressing a “you”\n\u003e\n\u003eWhat, after all, are Augustine, Montaigne, Kierkegaard, Emerson, and Nietzsche, if they are not lyric philosophers? How else to explain, in their work, the direct self-expression of the thinking subject in the process of attaining self-cognition?\n\n**Some philosophies are inclined more toward thoughts, others toward feelings.**\n\n\u003eSome philosophies are inclined more toward thoughts, others toward feelings. Hegelian philosophy (whose heart, not incidentally, is The Science of Logic) is abstractly speculative, while Nietzsche’s “joyful science” is not a science at all but a morality bursting with feelings that are not always virtuous: wrath, scorn, exultation, revulsion, and the desire for revenge. In the context of Nietzschean philosophy, feelings now and then flood the mind, suppress it, render it overly irritable and ecstatic. Vasiliy Rozanov’s works suffer from even greater emotional unrestraint, frequently projecting the philosopher’s feelings beyond the frontiers of his thoughts, which, despite his strong feelings, remain shallow or trivial\n\u003e\n\u003eAnglo-American analytic philosophy and Continental (including Russian) existential philosophy represent two extremes beyond which thinking and feeling occasionally separate. \n\n**Lyrical philosophy vs Philosophical lyric**\n\nIn lyrical philosophy, lyric serves philosophy. In philosophical lyric, it is the other way around.\n\n\u003eThis is lyrical philosophy or, if you will, lyrosophy, in which lyricism serves philosophy—in contrast to philosophical lyricism, in which philosophy serves lyric.\n\u003e\n\u003eIt is easy to understand what philosophical lyric is: Omar Khayyam, Donne, Goethe, and Rilke are examples. Lyrical philosophy, however, has not yet found its place in our system of concepts.\n\u003e\n\u003ethe expression “metaphysical poetry” has been well established for a long time in English and occurs many times more frequently than the expression “poetic(al) metaphysics.” At the same time, it is or should be obvious that no less space is given to lyricism in philosophy than is given to philosophy in lyric.\n\n**Philosophy is innescapably lyrical**\n\n\u003eIn lyric, as opposed to epic and drama, the object of artistic mastery is the speaking subject. The subject can feel and think about him- or herself, and so the lyrical “I” emerges (as opposed to the epic “he” or dramatic “you”). We have learned from Kant that a subject is inseparable from his or her acts of judgment on the world of objects and thus that all philosophy—as distinct from the empirical sciences, and insofar as philosophy is nondescriptive and nonanalytical—bears an insoluble residue of lyricism.\n\u003e\n\u003eIn each act of self-cognition, we exceed ourselves as the object of cognition: we become “overmen” in relation to ourselves. Gödel’s incompleteness theorems explain the impossibility of any system’s complete self-description within the framework of its own axioms—a limitation that proves to be the dynamic principle of any system in its progress to a new level of self-reflexivity.\n\u003e\n\u003eLyricism in philosophy makes evident the excess of the subject of self-cognition over itself as its own object. Such is the overall paradox of the human sciences, through which humanity studies itself: since it is impossible to objectify oneself, the subject in the humanities complements any act of self-description with an act of creative self-expression. Here is the source of the lyricism of human self-cognition; it manifests itself above all in philosophy, since philosophy continuously needs to ground itself as such, to compensate for the lack of an object specific to itself, and to justify its global, all-comprehensive scope.\n\u003e\n\u003eIn a broader sense, though, we can talk not only about lyrical philosophy as one of this literature’s species but also about the lyricism of philosophy tout court. If the human being is an animal preoccupied with self-determination, then philosophy is an especially human practice. The fundamental questions of philosophy are what philosophy itself is, what its vocation and subject area are, and how it is positioned among other practices. Philosophy does not have its own particular, “positive” object, and so, like humanity, is preoccupied with the conditions of its own possibility and/or necessity. Since the subject focused on itself is essential to lyricism, we may even speak of the generic lyricism of philosophy. Its lyricism is in this sense inescapable.\n\u003e\n\u003eHence, the issue of lyricism in philosophy, so far from being arbitrary, seems to me to be already the focal theme of philosophy as the experience of a self-substantiating and self-contemplating thought.\n\n**Lyrical philosophy relies on a thinking subject who is permitted to express itself**\n\nEpstein argues that this subject has to think universally though, not personally or mundane. Leaving the universal is leaving philosophizing.\n\n\u003ePhilosophy, which tends to feel shy about its lyricism, conceals it behind claims for epistemological objectivity and scientific veracity.\n\u003e\n\u003eLyrical philosophy is not ashamed of its rootedness in a thinking subject and permits expression of his or her subjecthood explicitly and systematically. At the same time, subjecthood as a means of self-expression for the transcendental subject (in the Kantian sense) should be distinguished from the purely personal subjectivity inherent to empirical individuals, with all their special inclinations and caprices. Subjecthood differs from subjectivity to the same extent as philosophical feelings differ from the mundane ones experienced in everyday situations, hence the necessity of distinguishing a lyrical image of the philosophizing “I” from the author as a biographical subject. Indeed, the lyrical protagonists of philosophy often present themselves as conceptual personae, under pseudonyms, such as “Zarathustra” for Nietzsche and “Johannes Climacus” for Kierkegaard.\n\n**Lyrical philosophy is a mode of philosophical literature.**\n\n\u003eAt the same time, lyricism as a specific mode of philosophy (along with drama, for example, in Plato’s dialogues) must not be confused with any of the intellectual directions, such as idealism or materialism, phenomenology or deconstruction, that lyrical philosophy tends to take.\n\u003e\n\u003eWhen discussing various philosophical schools and conceptual systems, we often forget that philosophy, like any other field of literature, embraces modes and genres that, to some extent, intersect with those of fiction.\n\u003e\n\u003eLyrical philosophy fully deserves consideration as a distinctive, still insufficiently explored mode of philosophical literature.\n\n# References\n\nEpstein, M.

While working directly on the Talahardin, you could write a long structural-shaped note in one sitting then go back to the note to extract individual notes from it. You can also do it the other way: start writing individual atomic notes ([[Aspire to write atomic notes but not to the expense of understandability and utility]]), which you combine to write a [[Structure notes]] or an essay.\n\nAn application of this in life is when the [[Sky level]] communicates with the [[ground level]] in a [[thoughts/life management system]]. At first, organizing your ground level helps you gain the mental space to think about your sky level. What is currently happening in your daily life could also show you what goals to pursue. Once these goals are articulated, your day-to-day processes change to accomodate these goals.\n\nYou can start anywhere: top-bottom or bottom-top. You can articulate what you want first before you take action or you take action first to get a feel of the land then articulate what you want (similar to [[convergence–divergence model of creativity]]; [[find your purpose through divergence–convergence]]). What is important is that as you craft your strategy in writing and in life, you maintain an open communication between the structural and individual.\n\n# References\n",

  "/Meditation-Aurelius-Book-Summary": {
    "title": "Meditation — Aurelius (Book Summary)",
    "content": "\nMy overall impression of this classic is that it is overrated. Perhaps with this, I am really judging the translation because it was a pretty hard read even when I'm someone who is actually used to reading hard, academic books. I read Robin Hard's translation, which featured an introduction and selected correspondences between Marcus Aurelius and his teacher, Marcus Fronto. I really don't expect my impression to change much even if I read a different translation.\n\nDespite this, I think it was a great gateway to the philosophy of Stoicism and I did found a few valuable lessons on how to live life from the book. Interestingly, some of these are lessons I first learned from reading Eastern philosophy. This convinces me all the more that the themes in the art of living are universal.\n\nAlso, Marcus had a couple of really weird and quirky metaphors that struck me. These hidden gems provided the much needed comic relief to a rather dull and monotonous ancient book.\n\nHere are, in my opinion, the Meditations' greatest hits delivered through direct quotes, paraphrases, and commentaries.\n\n## Book 2\n\n2.2 Fuckin' grow up dude!\n\n2.5, 2.11 Perform every action as though it is your last. (I find this really interesting. We're more familiar with the modern adage, \"Live this day as if it was your last.\" Marcus intensified this by encouraging us to focus on the tiniest unit of life—our actions. Frequent awareness of one's mortality is a constant topic throughout the Meditations and it is a happiness practice that modern positive psychology supports.)\n\n2.11 Things that happen to both good and bad people are not innately good or bad. They just happen. This is similar to a belief I am partial to called \"ethical nihilism.\"\n\n2.12 Don't be afraid of death.\n\n2.14 The present moment is all that matters. (Mindfulness is not just a Buddhist concept!)\n\n2.17 Philosophy is a practical guide to life.\n\n## Book 3\n\n3.1 Don't procrastinate. Death can happen anytime and old age will make it impossible for you to do what you want to do\n\n3.4 Comparing yourself to others deprive you of the energy you could use to work on yourself.\n\n3.11 Approach life methodically. This is where Marcus laid down his process of thinking.\n\n## Book 4\n\n4.3 You don't need to retreat to a place. You can easily retreat within yourself.\n\n4.7 If you give up victimhood, you stop being a victim.\n\n4.11 See things as they truly are.\n\n4.19 Thinking about your legacy is idiocy. Those who will remember you after you die will themselves die eventually. And even if your legacy continues, come on, your're dead! What use is that to you?\n\n4.20 \"Is this necessary?\" Ask this to actions and ideas. If the answer is \"No,\" eliminate.\n\n\u003e 4.31 Love the art that you have learned and take your rest in it.\n\n4.32 The returns should determine the amount of effort you put on any activity.\n\n4.36 Universal nature is all about changes. (\"Change\" is not just a Chinese concept!)\n\n4.39 Nothing is bad on its own. Your mind creates value judgments: statements about things being bad or good. This is a very amoralist stance which is similar to the Buddhist concept of nonjudgment.\n\n## Book 5\n\n5.3 Never mind the opinion of others. Follow your own mind.\n\n5.5 Be grateful of your qualities and talents.\n\n5.6 Do something good then move on. No need to announce or boast it.\n\n5.11 Ask yourself this always: \"To what purpose am I presently using my soul?\"\n\n5.16 \"Where it is possible to live, there it is also possible to live well.\"\n\n5.20 The obstacle is the way. (This is where Ryan holiday took it!)\n\n5.23 Everything pass including your troubles. So chill.\n\n5.28 \"You are angry with a man if he smells of stale sweat, or has bad breath? What good will it do you? He has such a mouth, he has such armpits; and being as they are, such exhalations are bound to arise from them. 'Yes, but the man is endowed with reason, and if he would only think, he could recognize his fault.' Gracious me, you have reason too, so set his powers of reason to work by making use of your own! Show him his fault, call it to his attention; for if he listens, you will cure him, and there will be no need for anger.\" (Haha, laugh trip!)\n\n\u003e 5.29 Smoke fills the room, and I leave it: why think it any great matter?\n\n## Book 6\n\n6.6 \"The best way to avenge yourself is not to become as they are.\"\n\n6.11 Great advice for building habits: \"Never miss twice. Return to your equilibrium immediately.\"\n\n6.12 Outer work vs. Inner work\n\n6.13 \"So follow this practice throughout your life, and where things seem most worthy of your approval, lay them naked, and see how cheap they are, and strip them of the pretences of which they are so vain.\"\n\n6.15 Change renews.\n\n6.18 Legacy is useless.\n\n6.19 If others can do it, so can you.\n\n6.21 The pursuit of truth requires that you are willing to change your mind.\n\n6.22 Focus on your own duty.\n\n6.27 Even bad behavior is useful because it satisfies a particular need. Anger against bad behavior is not the best response—truthful correction is.\n\n6.28 Death is a rest from our impulses.\n\n\u003e 6.47 In this world, there is only one thing of real value, to pass our days in truth and justice, and yet be gracious to those who are false and unjust.\n\n6.49 Be contented with the time given to you in this world.\n\n6.53 \"Acquire the habit of attending carefully to what is being said by another; and of entering, so far as possible, into the mind of the speaker.\"\n\n## Book 7\n\n7.7 Don't be ashamed of receiving help.\n\n7.8 Don't let the future trouble your mind.\n\n7.18 Do not be afraid of change.\n\n\u003e 7.21 Close is the time when you will forget all things; and close, too, the time when all will forget you.\n\n7.27 Be grateful for what you have. But not too much you can't let go when they're gone.\n\n7.28 Your mind can be a source of serenity, a place of rest.\n\n7.34 Famous people are easily replaced by new famous people.\n\n7.46 How can you live your best life possible in the time granted to you?\n\n7.58 \"Only pay attention, and resolve to act rightly in your own eyes in all that you do.\"\n\n7.59 \"Dig within; for within you lies the fountain of good, and it can always be gushing forth if only you always dig.\"\n\n7.61 Life is not a dance. It is a wrestling match.\n\n7.63 People don't intentionally become ignorant. If you remember this, you'll be more empathetic.\n\n7.64 Happiness in life depends on very few conditions.\n\n7.68 You can preserve peace of mind even in the middle of chaos.\n\n7.69 \"Perfection of character requires this, that you should live each days as though it were your last, and be neither agitated, nor lethargic, nor act a part.\"\n\n7.70 It is impossible to escape from the wickedness of others. It's very possible to escape from yours.\n\n7.74 Do not be tired of receiving benefits!\n\n## Book 8\n\n8.16 Changing your mind to follow someone else's advice is still a free action—you acted, not someone else.\n\n8.27 You have three relationships: (1) your relationship to yourself, (2) your relationship to God/Universe, and (3) your relationship with others.\n\n8.28 Nothing painful comes from the outside. Pain is an internal judgment of a value-free phenomenon coming from the outside. The mind constructs pain and suffering. (Very Buddhist.)\n\n\u003e 8.32 You must fashion your life one action at a time, and if each attains its own end as far as it can, be satisfied with that.\n\n8.33 \"Accept without arrogance, relinquish without a struggle.\"\n\n8.36 Great therapeutic advice on dealing with problems. His advice: Let go of the past and future. Focus on the present. Interestingly, this advice sounds a lot like mindfulness.\n\n8.44 \"See that you award this present time to yourself.\"\n\n8.46 The universe doesn't give you something you can't endure.\n\n8.48 The mind is a refuge.\n\n8.49 \"Always keep to first impressions.\"\n\n8.51 Independence + kindness + singularity + reverence = a resilient and temperate mind or life\n\n8.52 To understand yourself, understand the Universe. Physics and metaphysics is important in learning how to live.\n\n8.54 Thinking and learning should be like breathing—you observe what is arround you then you share it everywhere.\n\n8.56 Each individual has a mind of his own.\n\n8.60 The mind is like an arrow—sharp and accurate in hitting its mark.\n\n## Book 9\n\n9.11 If you can't change people, then just be kind to them. Kindness is useful when you can no longer change people.\n\n9.15 There is no value in the physical world. Value judgments are created by the mind.\n\n9.21 Each change is a death. Death is just change, not something to be afraid of.\n\n9.29 Do what you have to do even if nobody notices. Be satisfied to make even the smallest advance. \"The work of philosophy is simple and modest; do not seduce me into vain ostentation.\"\n\n\u003e 9.30 Neither remembrance nor fame nor anything else whatever is worth a passing thought.\n\n## Book 10\n\n10.16 Stop the talking. Just do it.\n\n10.24 Great questions to ask about how one uses one's mind.\n\n10.35 A healthy mind should be ready for everything that could come about.\n\n## Book 11\n\n11.5 What is your profession? To be a good person.\n\n11.9 It is possible to continue living according to your beliefs and being gentle toward those who oppose your beliefs.\n\n11.15 \"In short, a good and honest person should resemble one who smells like a goat in this respect, that anyone who comes near him is immediately aware of it whether he wishe it or not.\" (Haha)\n\n11.18 When annoyed and loosing patience, remember: you could die any time.\n\n11.19 It is not the actions of others that trouble us. It is our interpretation/judgment/reaction to their actions that trouble us. Fix your interpretation and you will fix your trouble. Your anger towards a behavior will bring you more suffering than the behavior itself.\n\n11.29 You cannot be an artist of life if you haven't lived yet.\n\n## Book 12\n\n\u003e 12.1 All those things which you hope to attain by a circuitous route, you can secure at this moment, if you do not deny them to yourself.\n\n12.4 \"So much greater is our respect for what our neighbors think of us than what we think of ourselves!\n\n12.6 \"Practice even at the things that you have lost all hope of achieving.\"\n\n12.17 \"If something is not right, do not do it, if something is not true, do not say it; for you should keep your impulses under your own control.\"\n\n12.21 \"In no great while you will be no one and nowhere, and nothing that you now behold will be in existence, nor will anyone now alive. For it is in the nature of all things to change and alter and perish, so that others may rise in their turn.\"\n\n12.23 One's death is not bad. It is good and beneficial because it is according to the law of the universe.\n\n12.26 \"...the life of every one of us is confined to the present moment and this is all that we have.\"\n\n12.27 \"...the pride that prides itself on its freedom from pride is the most objectionable pride of all.\"\n\n\u003e 12.29 Our security in life is to see each things as it is in its full nature, in both its material and its causal aspect; and to do what is right and speak what is true with all our heart. What remains but to enjoy one's life, linking one good act to another, so that not even the smallest space is ever left between?\n\n12.32 \"...imagine nothing to be of any great moment apart from this, that you should act as your own nature directs, and endure whatever universal nature brings.\"\n\n12.33 Everything rests on how you use your mind.",

Imagine the years that had to pass before this little reunion—30 years—a reunion I would've wanted to be different had it not for the language barrier. She is a Deaf but isn't versed in sign language. I would've wanted to ask her question, to get to know her, to have a glimpse of all those 30 years that passed. Because even if I don't have a single memory of her, I trust my mother's stories of how this woman, shunned by the outside world because of her disability, never married and lives with her family all her life (she's now in her 60s), used to protect me with everything she had, used to treat me like her own blood.\n\nMy mom said that when I was sleeping as a one-year old child on my crib, my ate, a two-year-old, would play around me and make loud noises. Tita Sabel would get really mad at her. My sister would retaliate, calling poor Tita Sabel \"pangit.\" When she was asked by my mom to leave because she was getting sicker  and sicker (weak lungs), she hugged me and kissed me goodbye like a real mother would do, tightly. She would never see me again after 30 years. She was my last yaya.\n\nIt's a shame I never experienced it, never regitered in my memory. But subconsciously perhaps, or in my body, I want to believe that my body remembers that brief period of affection when I was shown love by a complete stranger, something I know will probably never happen again in my adult life.",

Or is it the combination of what the watcher is doing and the object of its action?\n\nA mental state is a real-time condition of the mind. It is created primarily through the interaction of the material and the immaterial (see [[Indirect interaction theory per Patterson]]).\n\nThe following are some types of mental states:\n- [[desire]]\n- [[ends]]\n- [[thoughts/action]]\n\nWithin the performance of an [[thoughts/action]] are tiny mental states at every unit of time. This implies that pursuing a particular [[End state]], which itself includes a mental state, involves a collection of mental states. When pursuing a [[Goal]], the most ideal scenario is to pursue a desirable [[End state]] through a desirable [[Means]]. For example, I do yoga to feel good. The end state of doing yoga is feeling good but doing yoga itself already feels good. On the other hand, there are projects that will feel good in the end but will require feel bad states on the way towards the end.\n\nTO DO\n\n- Process highlights from the journal article on the differences of psychological concepts in Western and Eastern philosophy (Conceptions of the Self in Western and Eastern Psychology)\n\n",

He watched me drink one glass before kissing him goodnight when I was in grade school. I am not sure if it really worked, but I can’t think of anything else to do. Yesterday, I only had about four hours of sleep, and even those four hours were disjointed. I woke up several times in the evening until I gave up and just lied down staring at the ceiling.\n\nWeird, but that sleepless night coincided with an odd pinching sensation on the left front of my head. It wasn’t painful. It was just annoying. It cannot be ignored. It was there, appearing out of nowhere, telling me something I cannot fully understand.\n\nI drank the milk in one go, walked towards the sink, and started washing the glass. After this, I headed back to my room, where my netbook is open. I sat down on the bed as I opened the media player. I picked up the song book, opened it, and started playing a new Kingdom song published by the society last year.\n\n*Young man and young woman,*  \n*do give your heart to me.*  \n*My foe who now taunts me*  \n*will then be made to see.*  \n\nIf the milk isn’t enough, perhaps singing God’s song will suffice.\n\n*Your youth and devotion*  \n*to me you freely give;*  \n*You show all the world*  \n*that for me you really live.*  \n\nI felt the pinching sensation again.\n\nI drank the milk and I’m singing the song.

These definitions require one property or one set of properties before something can be called a religion. The property or set of properties can either be the substance ([[Substantive definitions of religion]]) or function ([[Functional definitions of religion]]) of the religion. Either way, monothetic definitions are binary: a form of life can either be  a religion or not.\n\nEdward Tylor's belief in spiritual beings and Paul Tillich's ultimate concern are monothetic definitions that use a single criterion. Meanwhile, the [[Five elements of a religion per Herbert]] and [[Five elements of a religion per Clifford Geertz]] are examples of monothetic definitions that use a set of criteria.\n\n# References\n\nSchilbrack, K.

Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University. https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2022/entries/concept-religion/\n\n\u003e Most of the attempts to analyze the term have been “monothetic” in that they operate with the classical view that every instance that is accurately described by a concept will share a defining property that puts them in that category.\n\u003e \n\u003e Monothetic approaches use a single property (or a single set of properties) as the criterion that determines whether a concept applies. The key to a monothetic approach is that it proposes necessary and sufficient conditions for membership in the given class. That is, a monothetic approach claims that there is some characteristic, or set of them, found in every religion and that if a form of life has it, then that form of life is a religion. Most definitions of the concept religion have been of this type.\n\u003e \n\u003e Edward Tylor proposes belief in spiritual beings as his minimal definition of religion, and this is a substantive criterion that distinguishes religion from non-religion in terms of belief in this particular kind of entity. Similarly, Paul Tillich proposes ultimate concern as a functional criterion that distinguishes religion from non-religion in terms of what serves this particular role in one’s life. These are single criterion monothetic definitions.\n\u003e \n\u003e There are also monothetic definitions that define religion in terms of a single set of criteria. Herbert’s five Common Notions are an early example. More recently, Clifford Geertz (1973: ch. 4) proposes a definition that he breaks down into five elements\n\u003e \n\u003e  Whether a monothetic approach focuses on one essential property or a set, and whether that essence is the substance or the function of the religion, those using this approach ask a Yes/No question regarding a single criterion. This approach therefore typically produces relatively clear lines between what is and is not religion.",

    "title": "My 2013–2014 Annual Review",
    "content": "\nOctober 2014.\n\nIt's amazing how fast time goes by. It has been a year since the end of my last semester in college, a year after I decided to sit back and think about what to do with my life, a year since I chose to live in freedom more than anything else.\n\nMost college students nearing the end of their university life know exactly what to do next. That's the reason why people go to college anyway. The choice of degree is expected to predetermine the choice of work. If you are not me then you have probably figured everything out. You know exactly what to do next after you step out of college.\n\nBut I am not that kind of person. I don't want to be that kind of person.\n\nIf you are like me on this matter rest assured that I have your back.\n\nIn this week's post, I would like to share with you the half-review of my past year. I tried to write everything in a single article but the post became so lengthy. So I decided that it would be better for the other half to be featured in the next post.\n\nI know 2014 has not ended yet. But for me, the journey I had since the beginning of this year has pretty much ended. I am ready to close this chapter of my life and figure out what to do next. I am ready to set bigger goals—goals that will declare the person in me.\n\nFrom my story I hope that you would be inspired to do one thing.\n\nTake risks.\n\nConsider this article a permission for you to do so.\n\nWhen I did the bizarre things I never thought I would do in the past year, no one gave me permission to do so other than my self. Because of that I felt frightened and dislocated sometimes.\n\nBut you don't have to go through the same thing I went through. I offer my hand to you as you leap into the unknown, as you confront your fears and trust in faith. I am here, so don't be afraid. Many people have done it before. There is practically no reason for you not to do so.\n\nSo take risks and have faith. Believe me. The worst never happens.\n\n## The Hundred-paged Document that Nobody Read (October 2013)\n\nThe bulk of this month was spent finishing a thick thesis that didn't resonate much with my definition of fun.\n\nIn my last semester in college, I began to feel dislocated from university life in general. I didn't want to stay in that place any longer—a place where everything you have to put in your brain is determined by a bigger authority.\n\nAt the end of my college life, I had only two subjects left—one I thought I liked (Thesis Writing) and one I totally didn't like (Spanish).\n\nIt is not that I disliked learning. I am an extremely voracious consumer of knowledge. But the university setup is something I think I won't thrive in, at least not anymore. This is a realization that hit me just of late after reading [Chris Gullibeau](http://chrisguillebeau.com/) and [Scott Dinsmore](http://liveyourlegend.net/).\n\nThe university, like the church, is still a hierarchy no matter how secular it is and no matter how liberal its education system is. I think my university has honored a lot of rights but I was yearning for more.\n\nI want to be entitled to the right to determine what to put inside my head every single day.\n\nAlthough this was still a vague idea back in October 2013, every single sensation that my body gave me as I wrote a hundred-paged document that no one actually read, not even me, was to finish school as fast as I can and just move on.\n\nI finished and bounded the damn thesis, which my adviser thought was great.\n\nWhat she didn't know was that I procrastinated a lot before I finished the job and that I left college with no soul left in me.\n\n## Lost Again (November 2013)\n\nAfter leaving college, I went with my aunt and my cousin's family to Southern Luzon to visit Legazpi City and Hacienda Escudero. This trip was enough to relieve me of all the stress of thesis writing and I got back home with the intention of reflecting on what to do next with my life.\n\nThe first thing I did was to read a book on career planning. But before I did that, I had a very small idea of what kind of job I would want to do. I thought anything related to some work I did in the past will do as a career. Back then I did not realize how big a concept \"career\" was. I did not know how different it was from work, passion, dreams, and goals. I thought if I chose one of the four kinds of jobs I preferred back then—academe, social development, disability work, or special/inclusive education—I'll have to do that and be proficient with that for the rest of my life.\n\nReading the career planning book was quite helpful in reviewing my previous life interests but I was still practically disabled.\n\nI did not know what to do with my life.\n\n## Bread and Butter (December 2013)\n\nAs I was thinking about the \"career\" I would pursue, a job was actually offered to me by the institution that was the subject matter of my thesis—[The Philippine Mental Health Association Baguio-Benguet Chapter](http://www.pmhabbci.com/). I was asked if I could continue writing their history to cover the years not included in my study, 1974 to 2013. Little did I knew that this would be my first real entrepreneurial venture.\n\nBut the go signal for starting the project came at a later time. I was excited about the project but I also have to earn money sooner so with the suggestion of my aunt, I applied as an E-Learning Professional for an Online English School for Japanese students. It's not like I planned for this. I never wanted to teach English. But I was lost and uncertain so I needed time to think while earning a good enough amount of money to pay for my monthly bills.\n\nThe work was so flexible, I did my personal projects in the morning while I worked in the evening. Although it was not ideal, this job provided me enough income to support myself while introspecting about my North Star—the life I was meant to live.\n\nFurthermore, because of this \"good enough\" bread-and-butter job I was able to launch this website and write again. I was able to rejuvenate my passion for reading and learning, something that really challenged me a lot in college and thus affected my grades.\n\nToday, I am in the process of monetizing my passion for writing and self-improvement but until I get into that, I think this source of income pretty fits me well.\n\n## Into the Academe, Or Not (January 2014)\n\nBy this time, I was already exploring the possibility of blogging but my efforts were quite scattered and misdirected.\n\nI was really thinking about venturing into the academe because it is the most logical and immediate answer to my dilemma. I pretty much know what academic life is, I had lived it for four and a half years. I had a good foundation in research and I was actually invited by one of my professors to try to apply to our university. In addition, I had this belief that the academe actually holds the solution to the problems of my country. Being an activist back in college, the prospect of using knowledge to change the world through the academic system sounded enticing.\n\nI also had a strong passion for starting a whole new body of venture research on the history of disability in the Philippines. I started a blog and opened a Facebook fan page on the subject where I published some of my research findings calling the whole idea, [Philippine Disability History](http://philippinedisabilityhistory.wordpress.com/).\n\nAt this time, I didn't have any knowledge or background in blogging and social media. I didn't have any competitive idea about leveraging the power of the internet to amplify one's voice and be heard by other people. All I knew was I cared and I wanted to start something and probably inspire others to do so.\n\nI am still quite amazed with the influence of this amateur venture research. Through the blog and the Facebook fan page, I was able to connect with interest groups from all over the world as well as individual advocates. They sent messages and shared some of my posts. I did not expect that through this blog I would be connected with a researcher of a similar interest who works as an instructor in the College of Saint Benilde in De La Salle University.\n\nThat is the power of blogging. It builds relationships and allows the meekest of the meek to be heard and inspire others to take action.\n\nToday, I had slowed down with this research venture. It has been months since I last read a history book. But I do hope that in the coming months, I would find time to water this passion again and maybe continue the journey as an [Independent Researcher](http://ronininstitute.org/).\n\n## The Voice Shouting Inside Me (February 2014)\n\nBy this month, I think I was really focused on finding a job. I was being inpatient about waiting for the PMHA to send me the signal to start the history and archiving project and as it has always been my nature, I started to feel a little tired with teaching English. I wanted to do something else.\n\nSo after three months of finishing my college life, I finally decided to look for a job.\n\nBeing the lazy cautious type of person that I am, I decided to plan out my job search strategy before venturing into the hustle. So I read the Two-Hour Job Search by Steve Dalton and applied his intuitive method.\n\nI think Steve's idea was very interesting and insightful. But after investing a lot of time reading his book and figuring out how to apply his methodology, two job openings emerged in front of me, which removed the need to search for more.\n\nThere was a vacant position at a nearby International School which needed a Middle School Social Studies Teacher. I was short-listed and was invited for an interview. The school principal wanted graduates from the University of the Philippines and the probability of my being hired was quite high.\n\nAt almost the same time, the University of the Philippines Los Baños was hiring instructors for its Social Science department and a very close instructor of mine was actually offering a hand to help me land a position.\n\nThose were terribly sleepless nights.\n\nThere I was, emerging from a one-year depressive episode, lost and left with no soul after a crushing semester, confused on what to do next with my life and with no confidence left in me, just the desire to live and to actually make this life work. But now I was being forced to think about my life, to dig deep inside my soul, and make a decision quickly.\n\nThese were really enticing jobs but a voice inside me was starting to shout; it was already pounding my chest and it was grabbing my hand forcing me to listen.\n\nI wanted to be a Social Studies Teacher, yes. I wanted to be an Academic, yes.\n\nBut I wanted to be more.\n\nBut I didn't know it yet.\n\nAnd to search for it, I needed time.\n\nLots and lots of time.\n\n## Beginnings of Nonconformity (March 2014)\n\nWhat I did next was the first sign of unconventionality I saw in me in many years.\n\nIn my entire life, I followed what was told to me. I obeyed despite a desire to question and to do my own thing. For many years I conformed and thus made people around me happy.\n\nBut with two traditional jobs that could potentially jump start my career in teaching, what I did was the craziest thing I did for a long time.\n\nI did not show up on the day of the interview and I did not follow up my interest on applying at Los Baños.\n\nYup. Crazy me.\n\nI haven't told this to anyone before, until now. And I know that some of my most well-intentioned friends and family members might think I am irresponsible with what I did.\n\n_\"Sayang\"_ they might think.\n\nAnd I understand them for thinking so.\n\nBelieve me, there were nights after what I did when I would just lie down on my bed, look at the ceiling, and torture myself. \"What was I thinking? What have I done?\" I would ask.\n\nBut then again I remember how life became brutal to me in the past years, how early I suffered from something I think I did not deserve, and how painful it was not to live according to what my heart is telling me.\n\nI reminded myself that when I asked my father if he could allow me to pursue my ministry instead of my college degree on that October night of 2010, I cried. I cried so hard that I fell into a terrible depression the following year—a depression that led to chronic dysthymia and other overwhelming problems,  a depression that I have to contend with every single day.\n\nI reminded myself that it is my right—and indeed everyone's right—to do what he knows is best for himself.\n\nI knew deep inside me that I have to go into intense introspection, self-analysis, and meditation to achieve clarity on what I want to do next in life and to emerge completely from what happened to me back in 2011.\n\nI think I deserve all the time to find my passion.\n\nToday as I look back to that crazy decision of pursuing my search for passion, I realize that that very idea brought me out of depression more than the drugs or the psychiatrists did.\n\nIn the past months that I have been living my life as a writer, the symptoms of my depression and anxiety have subsided in ways I never thought possible. Back when I struggled with my depression, I didn't like to do anything, a day was torture, and all I did was to lie down on my bed and watch television. But today, I wake up excited every morning because I have another article to write or another project to plan, or another idea to develop. It's just amazing. Just simply amazing. The pursuit of happiness cures all things.\n\n## Intense Introspection and A New Belief System (April 2014)\n\nAfter my decision to not follow through with the vacant positions, PMHA finally called me and said I could start writing their history again and archiving their documents.\n\nI think this was good news because aside from the evening English classes, I had a new source of income, which I could tap into while investing a lot of time in introspection and learning.\n\nSo I did the PMHA job during the afternoon then I taught English in the evening while I pursued self-learning in the morning.\n\nThis set up worked so well for me that I was able to read lots of books more than I was able to do in my entire four and a half years in college. I was able to rekindle my lost passion for reading and learning.\n\nI noticed that when I was in control of what I put inside my brain, I easily remember what I read and I strive to apply what I was learning.\n\nThis is one of the many self-discoveries I was able to find through reading and meditating.\n\nAfter reading books in the morning, I would ride my bicycle in the late afternoon and stop in front of rice fields, breathe and just digest everything I learned.\n\nThrough my intense introspection, I learned that I was naturally inquisitive and nonconforming. I realized that I was able to be a young pastor at the church which I left because I repeatedly challenged my own beliefs, question what was taught to me by Christianity, and validated everything through research and empirical evidence. Finally, I gave up believing after my core values were no longer aligned with what the bigger pastors were telling.\n\nThrough my reading, I discovered that there was a large number of people who would actually praise individuals that left their jobs to pursue their passions, that there were many successful people in the world today who faced very similar dilemmas that I currently face, and that it was okay to challenge the status quo.\n\nBy this time, I learned the power of the internet and social media to build the person you want to be and to find accountability and impact other people for doing so.\n\n## Starting and Failing and Starting Again (May 2014)\n\nAfter reading a lot on alternative lifestyle design, I bought a domain name and applied for self-hosting to venture into blogging.\n\nThe blogosphere just doesn't fail to amaze me on how successful it is in amplifying the voice of ordinary people, in helping individuals build relationships with like-minded peers from other parts of the planet, and in providing the tools for everyone to create their own platforms.\n\nSo after getting a lot of inspiration and tips from bloggers that I follow, I designed and launched this website to see where it would bring me.\n\nCreating and launching this website taught me a lot of things about life.\n\nWell, among many things, it taught me how clouded my brain was. Until I started brainstorming the content and direction of this blog, I never realized how much crap has filled my consciousness that all the creativity I once had was almost all gone.\n\nThe first domain name I bought was actually different from what I am using right now. I bought \"DailyPolymathy.com,\" which I planned to use to talk about how I would pursue my different passions but later on, I found myself feeling empty and uninspired with the subject matter. That happened after a month or so of intense brainstorming with all the papers filled with doodles and scribbles and mind maps of what I planned to do with my platform!\n\nI instead followed what resonated more in my heart and embraced the advice of [Dave Ursillo](http://daveursillo.com/) to be \"unapologetically me.\" So I bought \"VincentImbat.com\" and started writing about my life and my story.\n\nI consider this my first failure and my first taste of starting all over again. And in the next post, I will be writing about more failures and mishaps I did this year.\n\nBut it is what taking risks is all about. It's about building up that pile of failure and being proud of it. It's about getting out of your comfort zone and doing something you completely don't know. It's about planning as you go and get your hands dirty.\n\nThat is what creates the better person you ought to be.\n\nThat is what creates the person within you that you will always be proud of.\n",

    "title": "My 2014 Annual Review",
    "content": "\nAs 2014 is bidding farewell, the blogosphere is filled with people making their annual reviews. Among the many reviews I was able to read were those of Leo Babauta, Chris Guillebeau, and Scott Dinsmore.\n\nIn simple terms, an annual review is a practice done usually at the end of the year, which aims to look at the different things that transpired in one's life over the course of an entire year. The review consists of three parts:\n\n1. What went well throughout the year?\n2. What went wrong throughout the year?\n3. What will the coming year look like?\n\n## Guide For Your Annual Review\n\nThere are several awesome guides that could help you write your own annual review but for me, only two were really notable.\n\nFirst is Chris Guillebeau's process. What he does is that at the end of the year, he withdraws in a cabin in the woods for a week and does his annual review using a fairly simple template in the form of a spreadsheet and which he makes available for download at his site.\n\nIf you are interested, check out the template [here](http://chrisguillebeau.com/2014-annual-review-is-here/) as well as his really interesting annual review for 2014 [here](http://chrisguillebeau.com/2014-annual-review-lessons-learned/). Chris is really an achieved person. Having published several New York Times bestsellers, I think his annual review is worth checking out.\n\nThe best template for me I think is Scott Dinsmore's free workbook. Aside from the usual successes and failures roundup, he really guides you throughout goal-setting and weekly planning, which shows you how dedicated Scott really is in terms of the actual realization of your dreams and aspirations. I used it for doing my own annual review and I highly recommend his workbook. Get the free PDF files [here](http://liveyourlegend.net/2015-goal-setting-and-weekly-planning-workbook-downloads/).\n\n## What Went Well In 2014\n\nNow, I would like to share to you the results of my own Annual Review of 2014.\n\nHere is a list of the things that went well in my year.\n\n1. I discovered I was a polymath.\n2. I started [Philippine Disability History](http://philippinedisabilityhistory.wordpress.com/).\n3. I lost weight.\n4. I graduated (finally).\n5. I discovered lifestyle design.\n6. I discovered the blogosphere.\n7. I learned a lot about the real me.\n8. I got my first entrepreneurial gig as a writer and archivist.\n9. I was able to survive as a freelancer for one year.\n10. I launched a website and became a real blogger.\n11. I launched a free eBook.\n12. I deepened and rejuvenated several key relationships.\n13. I found my spirituality again.\n14. I worked at my first full-time job.\n15. I experienced living inside UP Diliman and at Metro Manila for one month.\n16. I saw Bulusan lake.\n17. I was able to pay for my own meds.\n18. I was able to join Fizzle for free, trained, and made new friends online.\n\n## What Went Wrong In 2014?\n\nWith all the successes I had the past year, here are their negative counterparts. Many of these were not necessarily bad. The truth is that the biggest failures we have are actually also our biggest successes because they ultimately point us in the right direction.\n\nHere are my failures throughout the year and I'm happy I had them.\n\n1. I feel some regret for not pursuing some available jobs.\n2. I thought I could live in Manila with very little cash but I was wrong.\n3. I was not able to control my anger and I waged war with my neighbors which made them very defensive and which makes it difficult to talk peace with them today.\n4. I failed to maintain my lifestyle and I have to move out of the house and the town because situations were getting worse.\n5. I failed with creating a good blog many times because I did not know what I was doing and I just experimented along the way.\n6. I assumed that starting a business was easy but it was way more difficult.\n7. I failed in building a really quality relationship with my girlfriend.\n8. I failed in building deeper relationships with my family, relatives, and friends.\n9. I was not able to surround myself with the right people.\n10. I was not able to build a mastermind group who would support me as I pursue my dreams and goals.\n11. I was not able to build any savings.\n12. I was not able to pay for my monthly health insurance regularly.\n13. I did not achieve any financial goals this year.\n14. My physical and mental health was poor the majority of the year.\n15. I was not able to make significant progress in some passions and skills I wanted to develop.\n\n## What 2015 Would Look Like For Me\n\nNow given all these things that went wrong this 2014, how would I want to improve?\n\nHere are the specific areas I wanted to put my attention on as well as goals that correspond with them.\n\n### Areas of Attention\n\n#### Health\n\n1.

    "title": "My 2015 Annual Review",
    "content": "\nLooking back on 2015, I would say this was my year of deeper understanding about who I really am and what I want to do next with my life.\n\nTo put my 2015 in perspective I'll align it with what I think my previous years' themes were. I'll start with 2011 because it was just a pivotal year for me.\n\n2011 - Awakening\n\n2012 - Renaissance\n\n2013 - Freedom\n\n2014 - Movement-Stasis-Containment\n\n2015 - Self\n\n(\\*Note: Since I am writing this spontaneously, I want to keep note of what I'm feeling along the way. Right now, I'm stuck with 2014. I just realized, 2014 was a difficult year to look back to. Maybe I was not able to reflect well on this, that's why. I can't nail it with one word. I'm putting \"Stasis-Movement-Containment\" to signify how I look at it today. Explanation below. It's significant for me because it sparked what I would say my best year ever since 2011 - this year, 2015.)\n\nSince I am a historian by training, allow me to do a timeline. Quite structured, quite systematic, and scientific, I know, but it's just how my mind works.\n\nFirst, how my 2014 sparked my 2015.\n\n## Pre-2015\n\n2014 was a year of movement. I launched this blog I was thinking about since finishing my undergrad in 2013. My dreams for the blog were two-fold (sometimes conflicting). I wanted to make a lifestyle business out of it but at the same time, I wanted it to represent who I really was, to express myself, and to change my life through it. Obviously, this leads me to a lot of adventures. Post after post, then a mini-book, then a few followers, etc. Launching and maintaining the platform for a few months became my life and I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nThen came a very pivotal struggle with my environment and my daily life in general. I was \"moving\" with my dream of being a writer/online entrepreneur but at the same time I felt \"static\" and \"contained.\" \"Static\" and \"contained\" because the process—my days, my weeks, my life in general—began to feel like a never-ending cycle of habits. Was this what working for myself looks like? Well, I realized, I was following the wrong advice, and that caused the suffering. Coupled with this feeling was the frustration that my environment was no longer serving my true and creative self. The neighborhood and the people around me were no longer making my inner life healthy. I had to leave. At least for a while.\n\nSo that sparked my 2015, my best year ever so far. And here it goes.\n\n## 2015: A Year in Review\n\n### January\n\nWith money enough to support me for a month or two I embarked on a quest for life at Metro Manila—no plans whatsoever, I just wanted to leave home. I started to try freelancing but it didn't work out so well so I realized I needed a day job to support me if I wanted to stay longer in my new home. I applied for two jobs and waited. Afraid that my money would be completely depleted before even getting a job, I decided to go home for a few weeks.\n\n### February\n\nI was accepted as a Research Assistant at the University of the Philippines. The pay was good, the work was no hassle (not yet), and I had enough time to pursue my other interests and side projects. I immediately invested in a beautiful place to stay in—a spare room at a house within a subdivision, a quiet haven in the middle of a busy metropolitan.\n\n### March\n\nI have to go back home again as our salaries were delayed. Because I was working for research funded by the government, I later realized I have to learn to cope with these possible delays in salaries. Good things definitely come with a price.\n\n### April\n\nSummer. So hot. So humid. This is tropical life! I had to get back to Manila as salaries were released and work resumed.\n\n### May\n\nRelatives from the United States returned for a month-long family reunion. I was not able to join them in every activity they set but I was there most of the time. The flexible job schedule made that possible. Overall, this month was a break from the challenges that came the months before. For the first time in a long time, I felt I was living the life I wanted.\n\n### June\n\nI began investing time on my personal development again. Feeling grounded at my new environment and having had done what I had to do to sustain my lifestyle, I was ready to focus on taking care of myself again. Interestingly, the more I tried to take good care of my body and mind, the more I got sick. Rainy days came, I caught cold, never-ending headaches, and extra-extra weight. Hm...weird. The best part of June however was my first trip to the beautiful city (within a forest) of Puerto Princesa, Palawan.\n\n### July\n\nJuly was the month that everything I never expected just happened. My health went spiraling down, my troubles with anxiety enveloped my days with no noticeable reasons, work began to feel a lot like \"work,\" and a working trip that finally made me realize how much I missed freedom. With just around 6 months in the job I thought I will be keeping for a long time, I resigned.\n\n### August\n\nI got back home teary-eyed, embarrassed. But my family, my father specifically, talked me out of the embarrassment. He said he missed me while I was gone and that he wanted me to be around. So, I decided to keep my life a little simpler, back home, back to doing freelance work, back to serving my soul, back to serving my passions, back to serving others. I launched a new mini-book and earned my first dollars/pesos from it. I was very happy.\n\n### September\n\nI noticed that during the entire month of August I was doing, doing, doing...creating, creating, creating...ah! the freedom!... I didn't have this for over six months and I was so excited to get back to creating that my drive was so strong...and then...it suddenly vanished! September was about slowing down, reflecting on what to do next in life. Ironically, it began my eventual descent into full-time freelance writing. I am forever grateful to the universe for providing me clients in my first month as a serious freelancer. But more importantly, September started the transformation of my relationship with writing, care of, The Literati Writers.\n\n### October\n\nAs I was slowly seeing the value of transforming my relationship with writing into a more healthy practice, I simultaneously began developing a strong thirst for all things spiritual..again. I began going back to the feelings associated with my history of Christian work as an ex-young pastor and realized that I was not really an atheist or disbeliever or Darwinist or Marxist—I was a spiritual junkie, always was, unable to detach myself from the sublime soulful vessel that I am. That was the biggest revelation I had for a long time—the biggest achievement of my 2015! I began reading, studying, and reflecting on Eastern philosophical texts and began calling myself a \"lightworker.\"\n\n### November\n\nAs the year is slowly coming to a close, I began to see clearer and clearer, who I truly am and the path that I am about to walk through in the coming months. I had glimpses of ideas—creative, professional, and personal but I was generally lacking the drive to live again. Here I was back to feelings of stasis and containment. Realizing that this is temporary and that unlike before I don't have to go through a drastic life change to feel \"movement,\" I embarked on two weeks of continuous travel and reconnecting with people. I went to Baguio City to see my sister, to visit a friend who was about to give birth, and to meet an Indian monk who talked to me about yoga, vegetarianism, and meditation. Then, I went to Baler, Aurora to surf and see the beautiful Dicasalarin Cove atop a lighthouse for a few days.\n\n_Dada (\"brother\") doing his afternoon meditation while he fed me fried mongo seeds and other vegetarian foods._\n\n_With my fried Aina a month before she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl she named Hiraya, a Filipino word which means \"imagination\"._\n\n_Dicasalarin Cove atop the Lighthouse at Baler, Aurora_\n\n### December\n\nDecember was a month of \"growth\" for me professionally. Not \"growth\" as in making more money but growth in the sense that I am slowly understanding how I can make this freelance journey more soul-nourishing. I had to let go of some clients who were just not the right fit for me and instead focused on looking for people with whom I feel comfortable working with. This process involved getting crystal clear on the qualities of clients I am looking for and sticking to work with those people and only them. Spiritual-wise, I'm currently dwelling on the idea of the \"divine in the ordinary\" and more radical applications of \"living in the present moment.\" Honestly, this is quite a challenge as I have a strong drive to do, do, and do as any creative would confess. I recently climbed a mountain a day after Christmas. After that the journey is unknown and I like it that way.\n\n_Before climbing the summit of Mt. Pico de Loro at Ternate, Cavite._\n\nTo conclude this rather long piece, I would say that 2015 was really the year I listened intently to the true \"Self\" within me, within every one of us, within the very universe we say we live in. It was a year that I think I began my path towards self-realization, towards accepting my real identity as a spiritual person of a more rebellious kind.\n\nWhile previous years were about getting back on track after what I went through in 2011, this year, this 2015, was different, because I really felt I was walking towards a higher realm. I was no longer just surviving or just recovering. I was already, despite seemingly tiny steps, flourishing! And I love this! Really, I love this! Just typing these words make me feel so good and proud about what my 2015 has become.\n\nHonoring the Self. Serving others through the Self. Getting crystal clear of what you want. Moving. Connecting. Then stopping to just \"be.\" Then moving again. These are things I experience during this year. These are the things I want more out of 2016 and all the years to come!\n\nDear friend, you, the reader who cares about what I have to say, enough to read my story, my life, what happened to me as I traverse my own journey, I wish you a good year to come. May your path be filled the things you want more out of life! Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n",

  "/My-2016-annual-review": {
    "title": "My 2016 Annual Review",
    "content": "\nCreating this annual review was deeply rewarding. It was like creating a mini-history book of my life in 2016. The latter parts of this year were still fresh in my memory but it was the earlier months of this year, which I needed to really review.\n\nLike the historiographic projects I used to do back in college, my review of the past year involved organizing my photographs and using them to fill in the gaps of my story. I shared a few of them below. I also needed to reread my journal entries—intimate and more than truthful primary sources—to look at specific patterns of thinking that emerged throughout last year. Overall, the process was a cathartic, deeply spiritual experience, which provided valuable insights on how I evolved and changed last year and how I might thrive in this new year.\n\nLooking back, I think 2016 was the year I really developed a deeper understanding and reluctant appreciation of the market economy. Throughout the year I confronted the issues of death, environmental degradation, vocation, poverty, and the violent \"unconscious\" economy. Ironically, as I progressed in my understanding of the material world, I went deeper into my spiritual journey and grew into trusting the things that we don't see more and more—love, peace, camaraderie—as the sole refuge to what could be a harsh universe.\n\n## My 2016 Timeline\n\n### January\n\n- I began my year by reading the _[Bhagavad Gita](http://amzn.to/2iXSx6j)_, and I immediately fell in love with the yogic philosophy, especially the concept of \"conscious movement.\" The book inspired me to live my 2016 in a similar fashion—to pursue goals mindfully and to strike a balance between walking towards the future and living in the moment. I wrote my intentions in a post entitled _How to Live Your 2016? Move Consciously_. Most of the goals I set at the beginning of the year were never achieved. But that is the true meaning of the philosophy: to let life surprise you and forget of a plan altogether.\n- I received a full scholarship from the Australian company Earth HQ for the first run of their Soulpreneurs Program. It was a seminal experience, one which was vital in encouraging me to continue with my indie career aspirations. Yvette Luciano, the founder of the online holistic entrepreneurship training was a kind, vibrant, and generous teacher who believed in my potential to succeed in the space.\n- At the end of the month, I visited Urbiztondo Beach at San Juan, La Union, and Tangadan Falls at San Gabriel.\n\n### February\n\n- This month, I saw more of La Union when I visited the _Bahay na Bato_ (House of Stone) at Bangar.\n- For the first time, I experienced an hour of coaching with [Dindin Reyes](http://www.thelargeworld.com/). It was an experience that really forced me to look at a few plain truths: I am craving for real community and I might have to give more attention to how I'm healing my old wounds.\n- The climax of this month was my three-day yoga retreat at beautiful Palaui. More than the alluring sea and landscape, it was the opportunity to practice yoga with really friendly and interesting people, which made the experience something I will never forget. I think I need to go back there this 2017.\n\n### March\n\n- This month was spent immersing myself in the Soulpreneurs Program and integrating my realizations from the yoga retreat. My biggest take-away from the Soulpreneur course so far was: \"I am not here to heal the world but to heal myself so that by doing so I might heal the world.\"\n- One of the most important realizations that came to me this month was a clearer vision of an ideal life I wanted to create. What I really wanted was a simple combination of spirituality, communion with Nature, reading, writing, intimate conversations with people, a source of income that provides \"just enough,\" and personal space, an environment that supports all that. Ten months after this insight, I still hold this vision.\n- One of the most awe-inspiring moments of my 2016 was seeing a _pawikan_ (sea turtle) hatch from its egg and slowly gained strength as it breathed the sea. We helped the little creatures start their voyage at sea hoping they'll come back after many years to repopulate their already endangered race.\n\n### April\n\n- This month, I signed contracts for two major academic writing projects from my biggest client so far. I projected that what I’ll earn from these two projects would be enough to cover my expenses for the entire year and, given my frugal lifestyle, perhaps even more. I was extremely grateful for the referral. Because of it, I was able to drop lower-paying gigs.\n- A few thoughts I had this month which left me awestruck as I review my journal right now: This month I was philosophizing about the benefits of keeping our passions devoid of monetary value. I realized that what I really wanted was to just do what I was doing and not to sell it, not to make money out of my art. Perhaps, this was an important realization that would, later on, convince me about the limitations that capitalism has brought twenty-first-century creative life. Also, I was thinking about the possibility of being more scholarly in my writing and the benefits of relocating.\n- This month, I spent a night at the Talisayen Cove at San Antonio, Zambales. I tried hiking the nearby mountain that housed a grotto but wasn’t able to finish because of the heat and I wasn't able to bring water. I'm coming back to this place and probably do the hike again.\n- This month, I also hiked Mt. Gulugod Baboy at Batangas, which astonished me with the best seascape I've ever seen in my life. Thank you so much Mother Earth.\n\n### May\n\n- At the end of April, I felt a little burnt out from the two projects I was working on. The beginning of May was a time for me to get back to my center—to connect with my Inner Self by engaging in mindfulness practices and creative projects and to revisit my life design and goals in general.\n- As part of this return to the center, I visited Bolinao again after a long time. The trip was invigorating but I was also deeply saddened after seeing how tourism has destroyed this once pristine haven.\n\n### June\n\n- Picking up from my spiritual journey in May, June was a big month for me in terms of rethinking the issue of vocation. To help me, I began delving deeper into the works of Parker Palmer, an activist and Quaker writer. This month, I read his books [_Let Your Life Speak_](http://amzn.to/2i7IJXK) (on vocation) and [_A Hidden Wholeness_](http://amzn.to/2j1LfOB) (on community).\n\n### July\n\n- This month, I finished reading two of the works of Dr. Robert Lanza, [_Biocentrism_](http://amzn.to/2iyjASb) and [_Beyond Biocentrism_](http://amzn.to/2jnolxK), as I tackled the interconnections of science and spirituality. It was one of the most mind-blowing reading experiences I have ever had. Dr. Lanza's work will prove useful to me at the end of this month and throughout 2016 as I experienced several encounters with death. Dr. Lanza is one of those scientists who use science to interpret phenomena that are at the core of being alive, one of which is the implications of a universe with no time to our understanding of death and the afterlife.\n- I continued to reflect on the issue of my personal vocation during this month while I enjoyed a creative splurge at the same time. My imagination was invigorated.\n- At the end of the month, I visited the National Museum in Manila for the very first time. I still can't believe I graduated with a Major in History without seeing this.\n\n### **August**\n\n- This month, I picked up the book [_Creating a Life Worth Living_](http://amzn.to/2jbQGbb) by Carol Lloyd. I deeply enjoyed her practical and realistic approach to building a creative lifestyle and career. After reading the creative archetypes she presented in her book, it became clearer to me that I have this constant, ever present dichotomy within me—I was a creative who both relied heavily on my intellect to produce work (Thinker) while at same time tapped into that part of me that escapes thoughts for rest, healing, and purpose (Mystic).\n- This month, I also began to welcome the thought of relocating (again). Although living in San Jacinto provides me with a simple lifestyle that allows for less work and more time for creative and intellectual pursuits, my need for community and connection with like-minded people has been a big problem for me for a long time already. It's something that relocating might solve.\n- I took my biggest trip of the year this month, flying to the humble yet captivating town of Coron in Palawan.\n\n### September\n\n- A year has passed after I left my independent contractor job at a research team at the University of the Philippines Emerging Interdisciplinary Studies (UP-EIDR) after which I started an independent consulting writing practice. I confronted the data from my financial review and reassessed my feelings about what I was doing. My first year as a freelance writer and editor was a roller coaster ride of income and emotions something I expressed in my post that month, _Maybe You Are Fighting More Battles Than You Can Handle_.\n- This year, I intended to build a strong foundation for my creative career by focusing on financial management. However, due to the facts that have now been revealed, I shifted my attention from wanting to understand how to be a better freelancer to wanting to understand money, the larger economy, and my place in the capitalist system.\n- To start this project, I started reading two books. The first book was The [_Last Safe Investment_](http://amzn.to/2jgjKgW) by Bryan Franklin and Michael Ellsberg, which presented a radical suggestion by saying that we should spend what we earn on things that will make us happier and increase our earning potential. It radically interpreted investment as not just a matter of finances. It connected the intangible aspects of life with material wealth and considered \"expenses\" on health, well-being, and happiness as actual \"investments.\" It was nice and was a fresh breath of air from the more conservative book I finished reading earlier this year: Your Money or Your Life by Vicki Robin, Joe Dominguez, and Monique Tilford. However, something else was lacking from The Last Safe Investment. I am thrifty and the book didn’t really advocate thrift. The second book I read filled this gap. I began reading Early Retirement Extreme (a really bad title for an otherwise epic book) by Jacob Lund Fisker. For the first time, I saw a book that advocated less dependence on the market economy as a tool for lessening hours and years at paid employment (read: early retirement). I never thought of paid work that way before so that bird’s eye view realization was really enlightening. By this book, I thought I found the answer to my problem (which was simply to keep doing what I was already doing—living a simple life). However, Jacob’s process involved investing, a skill that is complex and can be quite devoid of ethics and social responsibility. Of course, Jacob's uber-minimalist lifestyle when adapted by multiple people can be a big contribution to the alleviation of environmental, moral, and cultural degradation caused by over consumerism. However, there must be a better book, a better way of thinking—one that inherently connects our relationship with money and our desire for a better world. Fortunately, Jacob’s book pointed me to another inspiring work which bridged the gap between the pursuit of individual freedom through simple living and the social relevance of such a lifestyle.\n\n### October\n\n- I received a response to an email I sent a few months ago. It was from a client looking for writers for an academic general reference book series. I was accepted to contribute and I got a new gig. It was less lucrative than the first one but more exciting. I started missing school and the academe while doing the research. For a while, I thought about going back to school and getting a Master's degree but my inner radical won’t let me. I'll be reading [_Self-University_](http://amzn.to/2j497yv) by Charles Hayes this 2017 to enlighten me more on the subject of unschooling and self-education.\n- Jacob Lund Fisker’s book pointed me to William Coperthwaite’s only book entitled _[A Handmade Life: In Search of Simplicity.](http://amzn.to/2jgl0AG)_ It was a refreshing read. For the first time, I was exposed to a person who lived a life of voluntary simplicity and principled living, who bridged the gap between lifestyle and social change. Who would’ve thought that living with no running water and electricity can, by itself, be a form of civil disobedience? I am captivated by this hero’s life. Count me a follower. William Coperthwaite would open the doors for a new way of principled living I have very little idea about: homesteading. Like a lot of things in my life, the answer to many of my questions about money, work, and career was already under my nose. I am living in a farming community and yet I have never realized how important our relationship to the land is to our opportunity to enjoy freedom while contributing to healing the world at the same time.\n\n### November\n\n- The general reference writing project was cancelled. Although, we were compensated in full, this left me heartbroken because my work won’t get published. Nevertheless, this gave me enough time to think more about my relationship with money and the work that I am meant to do.\n- As a continuation of my education on money and economics, I finished reading [_Saved_](http://amzn.to/2j3ZFep) by Ben Hewitt. I understood more about the social construction of money and was excited to learn more so I began researching. Through Ben, I began to seriously consider farming and homesteading as part of the life work I want to build (now if only I could get a hand on a piece of land). What’s great about Ben is, unlike William Coperthwaite, he’s still alive and he can respond to an email once I decide to send one.\n- This month, apart from my self-education projects, I camped and hiked at Mt. Balungao, Pangasinan.\n- I also attended my very first two and a half-day sesshin, an intensive meditation retreat in the tradition of Zen Buddhism. It was difficult but enlightening. I met really awesome people after the closing ceremony, which was really the only time we got to talk to each other.\n\n### December\n\n- This month, I received my first technical copyediting assignment from the same company that offered the general reference series project. I was grateful that they saw my diligence in my previous job and were interested in working with me longer. The new project was a lengthy 13 chapters of a book on teaching sociology. Although I made a lot of mistakes (credit to my client for giving me a chance on something I have very little experience with), I learned a lot about the book publishing process just by doing this project. I received another project this January 2017 on a book about values-driven organizations.\n- I attempted to relocate to Sta. Barbara but changed my mind. I’ve decided to stay in San Jacinto until I have decided what to do next.\n- I began to give serious thought to the side effects of the meds I am taking to put my depression at bay. So, I visited INAM, a year after I left the research team associated with the organization, to consult about a transition to medicine-less treatment. The doctor prescribed me anthroposophic medicines but the inner radical in me and my newly acquired decision-making skills made me thought well about the matter before committing to any medical program. This will be an important personal project for me in 2017.\n- I finished reading [_Smart Choices_](http://amzn.to/2jsOU4P) and am looking forward to applying the process in my decision opportunities this 2017.\n\n## What Went Well\n\nThis was a great year for me business-wise.  Despite it being my first year as a real full-time freelancer, I was able to drop low-paying gigs for two high-level clients, one of which I think I’ll be keeping for a little while longer. The money I made was enough given my very minimalist lifestyle and for it I am grateful.\n\nThis was also the year I developed a more mature and conscious relationship with money. I spent more than half of the year building a foundation for my freelance writing/editing practice. Contrary to what most people think, freelancing is more difficult than traditional employment simply because a freelancer needs to handle most of the technical work, which employers handle for employees. The biggest challenge for me early on was keeping track of my earnings and managing my finances altogether. However, by September when I confronted the data from my first business year and a major project was canceled, I started to question what I was doing and spent most of October thinking about my general philosophy on money and making a living.\n\nThe inner philosopher in me has unleashed again and I started to ask questions like: What is money? Why does it even exist? Thankfully, I asked the right questions as these lead me to an important turning point in my intellectual maturity. I would say, my biggest achievement this year was my heightened awareness and consciousness on the subtle power of money and the importance of limiting my dependence on the market economy and helping our society’s transition towards a more nonviolent, environmentally-sound, and conscious economy.\n\n## What Went Wrong\n\nAs I mentioned above, although this was a great year for me professionally and financially, I experienced a period of doubt on whether to continue freelancing particularly in September when I hit the end of my first business year (because I started freelancing full-time in September 2015). This year, I experienced the loss of a few really promising clients, I experienced a few delayed payments, and there were big projects that never materialized. In November, my first project with a foreign client was canceled. Although I was paid the entire amount, the general reference articles I wrote were not to be published. All of these greatly affected my confidence in what I was doing. I realized I could do better in terms of building my brand as a writer/editor and that is inevitable if I want to continue working in a competitive marketplace.\n\nThis year, I experienced a lot of confrontation with death. In July our family lost Helene, in August two of our most cherished dogs—Kara and Bubbles—bade farewell. They were with me during the most difficult time of my life and that hurt me more than anything. The Philippines also saw an increase of people being killed due to the war on drugs, one of which I myself saw near our neighborhood during a morning bike ride. Although these experiences are disheartening, they taught me a lot about coping with grief and developing acceptance of what is.\n\n## What I'm Looking Forward To This 2017\n\nWhile I'm open to anything that could happen in 2017, I'm looking forward to integrating all the important lessons I learned last year into making a big life and career pivot this year. My need for community is something I was not able to fully address last year despite the many interesting people I've met. I need to be close to where I belong if I want to thrive in the vocation I will commit myself so a relocation might be an important decision I have to make and implement this in 2017. Life is all about relationships after all and the healthiest, happiest people are those who are surrounded by the right people.\n\nHere's to a community-filled 2017!",

    "title": "My 2017 Annual Review",
    "content": "\n![Santa Maria Sunset Blue](santa_maria_sunset_blue.jpg)\n\nMy favorite part of ending any year is the annual review. My annual reviews put me in a better position whenever I start a new year. Plus, looking back at the memories I created in the past year is an emotionally fulfilling practice.\n\nFor my annual review of 2017, I will be following [James Clear's](https://jamesclear.com/annual-review) simple format. I will be answering three questions:\n\n1. What went well this year?\n2. What didn't go so well this year?\n3. What am I working towards?\n\nFor a twist, I will be applying each of these questions to the three main areas of my life:\n\n1. Self-care\n2. Personal transition (to a lifestyle that is less dependent on the market economy and less destructive of the environment)\n3. My mission\n\n## 1\\. What went well this year?\n\n### **Self-care**\n\n- I have maintained my mindfulness practices to a point where I do meditation and yoga every day as long as I am not traveling.\n- I was able to rekindle a few relationships that I thought were already dead.\n- Entering 2017, I made it my intention to fill my life with community. I think I made a good job fulfilling this intention. This year, I made a lot of friends and I was able to connect with several communities: Ginhawa, FLOW, and HEAL.\n\n### Personal transition\n\n- I have deepened my understanding and appreciation of economics.\n- I have started volunteering on a farm where I help in growing vegetables in exchange for food and accommodation.\n- I have also begun to grow my own vegetables at home. My goal is to be food sufficient and resilient in the near future.\n\n### My mission\n\n- This year, I created and launched this new website to house a [mission](/about) that has become clearer.\n- I also launched a collaborative ebook this year – _Tanaw: Eleven Filipino Perspectives On A More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know Is Possible_.\n- I returned to freelancing towards the end of the year. This gave me more time to focus on my mission.\n\n## 2. What didn't go so well this year?\n\n### Self-care\n\n- I am still on medication throughout this year and I haven't started tapering.\n- I can do a better job of improving my sleep.\n- I still am not eating as healthily as I want to.\n- I have been moving less compared to previous years.\n\n### Personal transition\n\n- It wasn't until the middle of the year when I realized that what I really wanted to do was to \"transition\" towards a lifestyle that was easier on the Earth and less dependent on money.\n- My goal entering 2017 was to build a large capital to invest so that I could retire early probably within a five-year period. So early this year, I took on a full-time job which earned me a good sum of money. However, I, later on, realized I didn't really want to be an investor. What I really wanted to do is to master my relationship with the material world through voluntary simplicity and resilience. Like most of my previous years, navigating my relationship with the material world this year was made up of many trials and errors. While I find most of them necessary, I could have made better decisions that would have lessened the difficulties I faced this year.\n\n### My mission\n\n- While I have launched a website and an ebook, I wasn't really able to write a lot. I could have created more if I wasn't too focused on my personal transition. Now, that I am back to freelancing, I expect that I will be able to study, write, and create more things that I hope people will find helpful.\n\n## 3. What am I working towards?\n\n### Self-care\n\n- To be honest, this is an area I haven't completely made up my mind with. What will I be focusing on this 2018 with regards to taking care of myself? Definitely, I intend to continue my mindfulness practices, sleep better, eat better, and move more.\n- I will also be researching the science behind medication tapering so that I could finally come off my medication.\n\n### Personal transition\n\n- I intend to continue pursuing two goals this year: (1) lessen my dependence on money and the market economy and (2) lessen my ecological impact.\n- To lessen my dependence on money, I intend to continue volunteering at the HEAL farm and on other farms around the Philippines. Volunteering on these farms is part of my desire to learn how I can achieve food sufficiency and resilience.\n- I will also be nurturing my relationships with people so that I could rely more on community rather than money.\n- This year, I will be experimenting with a few personal economic practices like income topping, gifting, and non-accumulation. I will be writing more about these practices and my plans for instituting them in my monthly routine in a future article.\n- I also intend to lessen my ecological impact by traveling less, especially by plane, and by changing several habits that I have, which contribute to the destruction of Gaia.\n\n### My mission\n\n- After encountering [Steve Patterson's work](http://steve-patterson.com), I intend to focus on studying logic and philosophy. I'm thinking about using whatever I learn to check the foundations of the beliefs and concepts that I held on after leaving my childhood religion in 2012. I know that this intention will lead me to different places so I'm not setting a lot of expectations and goals on my mission this year. I'll just begin and see where it brings me.\n- While I'll be focusing on personal study, I do intend to write more this year and populate this website with articles and other instructive content. It will be part of my learning journey this 2018.\n",

    "content": "![San Jacinto Sunset 2018](san-jacinto-sunset-2018.jpg)\n\nLike I did last year, I'm writing a review of my previous year. I will be using the same guide questions I used in [[My 2017 annual review]], all of which I borrowed from [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/2018-annual-review). The questions are:\n\n1. What went well this year?\n2. What didn’t go so well this year?\n3. What am I working towards?\n\nLast year, I took James Clear's questions and applied them to the three main life areas that I track. Back then, these life areas were named:\n\n1. Self-care\n2. Personal transition\n3. My mission\n\nAs I developed a better understanding of how the right categories can be used to sharpen our thinking, I have decided to settle on the following names, all of which capture the same concepts I used last year but in a broader level. The new names are:\n\n1. Health\n2. Sustenance\n3. Meaning\n\nWhy I chose these words to capture the broad areas I want to keep track of in my life will be explained in a different post. For now, it will suffice to say that I use health to refer to mental, physical, and social wellbeing; sustenance to refer to all kinds of actions I need to take to keep myself alive through material and financial resources; and meaning to refer to everything I do to flourish.\n\nFeel free to use my format to write your own Annual Review.\n\n## 1\\. What went well this year?\n\n### Health\n\n- I continue to maintain a daily meditation practice, carrying over this healthy habit from last year and a few years back then.\n- I completed all five days of a sitting meditation retreat last November. In previous years, I was only able to finish at most three days. But this year, I was finally able to stay until the end and with great reward!\n- I was able to quit coffee and alcohol for more than one month and my sleep immediately improved. I have returned to drinking coffee in the morning only.\n- I was able to improve my sleep for about a month while quitting coffee and alcohol.\n- I have added a new habit to my morning routine. After drinking two glasses of water, I immediately take one tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar. It has an immediate mental kick, which I find stronger than coffee! Plus, it has a lot of health benefits.\n- I'm going strong with my five-minute journal practice. For almost two years now, I have been writing gratitude entries and setting intentions in the morning while reviewing my day in the evening.\n- In the second half of the year, I went through a grieving process, which I continue to go through until now. While the process is painful, it was a great learning experience. I learned a lot about how to cope with grief in a healthy way and how to prepare for the inevitable losses that all of us will ultimately face. It's a lesson I haven't learned even after going through depression so I am grateful that I experienced it this year.\n- While in the grieving process, I deepened my relationship with two friends. I was also able to cultivate existing but forsaken friendships with four people. What's more, I was able to start a few more friendships. It's easy for me to count my friends because I try to connect with people in a really deep level. When you are my friend, it isn't fleeting stuff. We'll be sharing our deepest thoughts. That's just who I am. And the people drawn to me seem to be like that too. Awesome.\n\n### Sustenance\n\n- I didn't stress myself a lot about money this year because my savings are pretty intact. By the end of the year, I took on more work that I did the past months to recover the savings I used up. But for the most part of this year, I dedicated my energy to studying philosophy, grieving, and exploring other art forms like poetry, photography, and translation.\n- While I am yet to really dig it, my exposure to Austrian Economics was really helpful in improving my understanding of money and the material world.\n- I invested on a wireless hair clipper and I taught myself to shave my own hair. I have chosen a haircut that I can do myself (the buzz cut), and I have been cutting myself for at least three months now. As long as I take good care of my hair clipper and keep a simple haircut, I will be saving around one million pesos until the day I die. This and other similar decisions were inspired by Jacob Lund Fisker and the [Early Retirement Extreme](http://earlyretirementextreme.com) book and community, which is really a resource about extreme frugality more than it is a resource on early retirement.\n- I also invested on a bike repair toolbox, which I used to learn fixing my own bike. I ride my bike almost every day as a form of exercise and meditation. I also use it as my form of transportation when visiting our place in Santa Barbara. While I still ride public transportation for longer trips, I don't own a car and will never own one. If I will own any vehicle, it will be always be the bike. Learning to repair it myself is another form of investment that lessens my dependence on the money economy in the long term.\n\n### Meaning\n\n- I dug a lot of podcast episodes this year, and I shared a few of my favorite podcasts.\n- I read a few important books this year, which I shared with you in my previous [[My hero books of 2018|post]].\n- I have started writing poetry, and every time I write a poem I really feel replenished creatively. It's a practice I will continue to deepen in 2019.\n- I have also started writing translations both in Filipino and in Pangasinan.\n- I took a lot of photographs this year, which also means I took a lot of afternoon walks and bike rides.\n- Earlier this year, I set myself out to study philosophy independently. While the field is so wide and there is a lot more to study, I feel like I did a lot of important work this year with regards to improving the way I think about things.\n- I was able to keep a consistent newsletter publishing routine earlier this year and people really loved it! I took a few months break but I'm back to writing them again, because I enjoy sharing stuff and my friends love reading them. If you haven't subscribed, please do so [here](/newsletter/).\n\n## 2\\. What didn't go so well this year?\n\n### Health\n\n- I began tapering my psychiatric medications early this year but have to return to my previous dose to support my grieving in the second half of the year. While it was the right decision to pause tapering, it would have been great to end the year with lesser dependence on these drugs. I'll try again this 2019.\n- While, I was able to experiment on sleeping better, I'm still not sleeping enough this year.\n- I quit coffee and alcohol and drank only pure water for more than a month. But for the most part this year, my diet isn't as great as I want it to be.\n- Because I repaired my bike, I think I moved better this year than I did last year. But I still have to keep my physical activity more consistent.\n- While I did well developing my relationships this year, my state of social health is not yet flourishing as I want it to be. The biggest challenge is geography really. My people are miles away from me. Scheduling time with the people I love needs more effort to be consistent and improve in this area.\n\n### Sustenance\n\n- My goal entering 2018 was to volunteer in farms, practice extreme frugality, and advocate for gift economics. This plan has to pause and be reassessed after I realized I really wanted to focus on philosophy this year. While not really a failure (because I invite trial-and-error in my lifestyle), this change caused me a little stress this year. Luckily, through some advice from a friend and personal reflection, I was able to continue studying philosophy without stressing much about money this year.\n- Because I worked less this year, my savings dropped. Also, I noticed that during the grieving process I tend to spend more money for food and entertainment. I wasn't too hard on myself during this difficult time. Luckily, as my emotions got more stable, so was my spending. Slowly, I'm going back to being more mindful with how I use my money.\n\n### Meaning\n\n- This year was a great creative year. I tend to use art as my refuge when I'm going through a tough time. This means I spent most of the year at home doing stuff. So if there's anything that didn't go so well this year, which I did more often in previous years, it's probably traveling. It's not that bad. I mean, while traveling can fuel creativity, it can also disturb routines that build creativity. So not traveling a lot this year was okay. But next year, I hope to travel more especially with friends.\n\n## 3\\. What am I working towards?\n\n### Health\n\n- In the coming year, I will continue to grieve, I will give myself enough time to do that.\n- I will also be working on my habits again using James Clear's [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). Specifically, I will be targeting sleep, nutrition, and exercise.\n\n### Sustenance\n\n- Since I have to let go of this area in 2018 so I can focus on doing philosophy last year, I'll slowly get back to working on my material needs and finances. For starters, I plan on creating a personal economic plan using concepts and tools that I already know and use. I also plan to share these concepts and tools to my readers and friends because a lot of us really need it. If I can finish creating a book or a course on this subject, I'll let you know as soon as I start creating it.\n\n### Meaning\n\n- After my exposure to philosophy last year, this 2019 I will take my project to the next level by writing more about what I am learning here in the website. My ultimate goal is to write a book about my personal philosophy of living. Before I could take on that monumental task, I need to do a lot of research, reflection, and preliminary writing. As always, I will be using this website to create the work I want to create.\n- Aside from continuing to build my worldview, I plan to continue all the other art forms I started exploring during the second half of last year (poetry and translations).\n- I also plan to explore more music. In fact, I have started a [musical diary](https://austinkleon.com/2018/12/20/musical-diaries/) which I learned from Austin Kleon. I'll be creating two diaries: one for international music and one for original Pilipino music (OPM). My OPM 2019 playlist is up on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/12156583444/playlist/7AYEtNdTCNqgMAUcCU3EC7?si=_d-7H8a_QIudu39F4bnNHg).\n- I also plan to start a hobby this year. While I'm open to all options, drawing is something that is really starting to call me. I used to draw really well when I was younger. Now I have completely forgotten how to draw. It's probably time to get back to doing it.\n- I'll be publishing more consistently in this website and in my email [newsletter](newsletter.md).\n- I don't want to set hard goals, never did. So another creative project I might start this year is a podcast/oral history project which will feature interviews with Filipino friends and people living not-so-conventional lives. I enjoy deep conversations and this is probably a good opportunity to make myself accountable for doing creative work while engaging in something that I really love.\n\n## Bonus question: What did I learn this year?\n\nJames Clear actually changed his third question (What am I working towards) with this new question (What did I learn this year?). While I still think the old question is useful for an annual review because it prepares one for the coming year, I find the new question interesting so I'll give it a try.\n\nHere are some of the many lessons I learned this year.\n\n**Marry well.** It's a phrase I'm borrowing from Austin Kleon and will use it the way he used it, broadly. A creative needs to choose who to associate him/herself with whether that's a life partner, a creative partner, a client, everyone, wisely.\n\n**Life is a big game of grieving.** Almost everything in life involves change. Change, in turn, involves lost. While we were taught how to \"have\" things, we were almost never taught how to \"let them go.\" There is probably no skill more critical in life than learning to grieve and to let go.\n\n**The best people to be with are not necessarily the people I have similar interests or philosophies with.** The best people to be with are those I can be completely myself with, without judgment. I notice that I become really relaxed and genuine when I'm with high school friends. These people do not share the passions and the identities that I have accumulated through the years. But that's where the magic happens; what I share with them is that piece of me unchanged throughout the years. That's why hanging out with this people is really refreshing.\n\n**If we let go of our beliefs on what is objectively good or objectively bad, we see the world clearly, we see others as they really are and not as we think they are.** This is Eastern philosophy's \"non-judgment\" and Western philosophy's \"amoralism.\" The more we let go of wanting others to act a certain way, the better our chance of really connecting with them, and thus the better our chance of achieving peace.\n\n**Focus on the fundamentals.** In philosophy, this is logic. Get your logic wrong and the rest of your thinking will be flawed. Believe in logical contradiction and your entire worldview will be irrational. The same goes with building habits. To master behavior change, focus on the tiny actions you take every day and let go of the grand goals.\n\nAnd that's everything for now. Here's for a better year ahead for all of us! As always, thank you for reading.\n",

  "/My-2019-Annual-Review": {
    "title": "My 2019 Annual Review",
    "content": "\n![Bike and shadows](annual_review_2019.jpg)\n\nBetter late than never.\n\nWriting my annual review is one of the highlights of my year and I was looking forward to finally write and publish mine. However, my New Year started differently from what I expected as I was forced to deal with a health issue almost as challenging as my [[Seven Lessons I Learned Since My Depression In 2011|depressive episode in 2011]]. This meant postponing my writing and publishing of my annual review of 2019.\n\nI feel very fortunate and grateful to be in a position where I am able to actually finish something to share with you today despite everything I'm going through right now.\n\nLike I did the previous two years, I reviewed the three main areas of my life in 2019 (health, sustenance, and meaning) using these three questions:\n\n1. What went well this year?\n2. What didn’t go so well this year?\n3. What am I working toward?\n\nI also answered a fourth question: What did I learn this year?\n\nAll these questions were from [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/annual-review). I hope you find something useful in my personal journey in 2019.\n\n## 1\\. What went well this year?\n\n### Health\n\nI was able to sustain an intermittent fasting regimen for the entire year and I have achieved results. I no longer eat breakfast, and I only eat by 11:00 AM. This freed my mornings from the drowsiness I usually get from a full stomach. It also gave me some extra time to do sustenance and creative work. I no longer have the feeling of overfeeding myself, but I don't feel deprived as well. Fortunately, I was also able to lose some weight and other people started noticing.\n\nMy regimen is not yet ideal. I still want to push my first meal to 12:00 NN and eat only until 8:00 PM. In fact, I started at 10:00 AM then 10:30 AM, slowly so that my brain (and stomach) do not resist. This is something I learned from [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/) and his book _[Atomic Habits](/atomic-habits/)_. I am after establishing the habit first. I'll optimize later, which in this case involves moving my first meal to 12:00 NN and eventually cutting my servings or portions. This is, by far, my biggest health achievement this year, and I'm proud of it.\n\n### Sustenance\n\nI continued working as a freelance editor this year. My earnings took a massive hit when a major source of book editing projects changed its business model and no longer brought consistent work. It's one of the realities that freelancers have to face. Fortunately, I have prepared for times like these and have enough savings to support me for an entire year.\n\nAfter receiving word from this source, I immediately started looking for alternative sources of projects. I found [Michael LaRocca](http://www.michaeledits.com/), a veteran freelance editor who wrote a book about how he started freelance editing. His advice was really helpful in my search for alternative sources of income as a freelance editor.\n\nIt didn't take long before I found a new source of editing projects. With the help of three references, I went through the application process and was surprised to know that my editing skills were actually good enough to get me in! I've been editing for more than two years now but I still doubted my editing skills sometimes (if not most of the time). So, getting a place in this elite pool of freelance editors was a testament to the hard work I've put into editing.\n\nThe new source was actually more ideal than the previous because it offered shorter assignments with higher rates of return. Plus, it was very, very flexible, something I always need in my creative spontaneous life. I am very grateful for the three people who wrote letters of recommendation for me. Without them, I wouldn't get in the pool.\n\nAs a creative, I use the [Einstein/Day Job model](https://puttylike.com/dont-let-anyone-shame-you-for-having-a-day-job/). My art is my career. My work as a freelance editor is just there to pay the bills and support me financially as I do my art.\n\n### Meaning\n\nThe biggest highlight of my year in this area is expanding and maintaining a creative routine in the morning.\n\nI work in the afternoons, sometimes, extending my working hours up until the evenings when I have a deadline. I don't have weekends as I also work during those days. Because my mornings are free and my mind is usually sharp due to intermittent fasting, I use my mornings to explore my various artistic pursuits and creative interests. I'll be writing more about my current [[My Morning Routine (May 2018 Edition)|morning routine]] in a future post but, for now, I'll mention that my morning creative routine usually involves the following:\n\n1. Reading at least two poems\n2. Reading all the entries for that day in Thoreau's journal\n3. Reading a page, a section, or an entire chapter of a book\n4. Writing in my diary for at least five minutes\n5. Translating one chapter of the Tao Te Ching to Pangasinan\n6. Doing one drawing exercise (I'm exploring [Lynda Barry's exercises](https://thenearsightedmonkey.tumblr.com/) but also draw my own poetry comics.\n\nSometimes, if I still have time, I would post an article on the blog and send it to my newsletter subscribers.\n\nStarting and maintaining this routine was easy because I already have a morning routine established, which means I just have to stack each creative activity over another.\n\nI think it's also worth mentioning here that I was granted a fellowship at the University of the Philippines Institute of Creative Writing's (UP ICW) Saling Panitik: Ikalawang Bienvenido Lumbera Seminar-Palihan sa Pagsasalin, a seminar-workshop in translation. This was one of the highlights of my creative journey this year and the experience and learning were really amazing.\n\n## 2\\. What didn't go well this year?\n\n### Health\n\nMy biggest setback in 2019 was getting an ear infection in September. It only affected my left ear so one of the doctors I later consulted said that I may have injured my eardrum with a cotton bud when I was cleaning my ear. I clean my ear every evening after I take a shower and I do insert the cotton bud until the ear drum so I may definitely have done this. I know now that this was very dangerous and very wrong. It's probably one of the littlest things I did, which I will forever regret. I could've spared myself a lot of pain, frustration, and money if I only knew this. Why didn't my teachers and parents tell me about this?\n\nI failed (or maybe the doctors too?) in managing the infection and it returned; this time, it was really bad that my doctor had to prescribe a really potent ear drop antibiotic, which was a little painful when applied. The infection was finally cured by December (almost four months of an ear infection!), but it left me with a large hole in my eardrum; so large that it was almost only the sidelining left.\n\nI should probably be grateful that the infection did not destroy any nerve or bones in the ear. Nevertheless, the experience was still really bad and it was my first experience of having hearing loss. My hearing test (audiometry) revealed that while my inner ear was still strong and unaffected, I suffered mild to moderate hearing loss on my left ear. Communication became a little bit difficult in the following months. The biggest setback from all these, however, was:\n\n1. being told that my eardrum won't be able to close itself and\n2. developing tinnitus, a constant ringing in my left ear.\n\nThe first problem caused me a lot of anxiety. The surgery required to close my perforated eardrum (tympanoplasty) will cost me Php 90,000. While some opt not to get their eardrum surgically closed, this puts them into the risk of recurring ear infections, which could lead to other worse ear problems. I am currently working with a new doctor who suggested (finally) to take an observation period to assess whether or not my eardrum could still fix itself. My eardrum healing itself will really be ideal.\n\nThe second problem caused by my ear infection and a perforated eardrum was developing tinnitus, a constant 24/7 high-pitched sound in my left ear. This is currently my biggest life challenge and I'll be writing a separate post about it in the near future.\n\n### Sustenance\n\nMy earnings as a freelance editor declined in the early second half of 2019. I continued to write podcast show notes to cover the deficit, but it wasn't enough. The book editing company that used to send me book editing assignments changed its business model and it no longer offered a la carte book editing, which meant that this source of income was completely lost. Luckily, I have an emergency fund in place, which helped me go through down months, and by November, I was able to find a new source of consistent editing projects, which was more ideal than the one I lost.\n\n### Meaning\n\nWhen I wrote my Annual Review last year, I mentioned that I wanted to travel more in 2019. I wanted to go on a solo adventure and maybe travel like I used to do. I failed terribly in this intention. I haven't gone on any solo trip since 2018, and I only had a few trips this year: one in Laguna and another in Cebu.\n\nI'm slowly getting comfortable with the reality that I'm probably more of an indoor rather than an outdoor person. There are so many things I want to read, write, and think about inside my head that the only regular outdoor activity I am able to sustain is my afternoon bike ride and walk, which fuel my indoor projects as well. Nevertheless, I will continue to set this intention of seeing the world more this year, especially Nature, and this is despite the fact that I am dealing with a health problem right now.\n\n## 3\\. What am I working towards?\n\n### Health\n\nHealth will be a big theme for me this year. It has already been a big theme for the first 19 days of 2020 and there are no signs of this being not the case. I am both scared and optimistic and will need all the support I can get as I go through another health challenge.\n\nI have started improving my sleep in the past few days of 2020 and will continue to do so, with exercise aiding me in this goal. I find that when I sleep well the previous night, I am better able to deal with my tinnitus and react to it better. I also intend to strengthen my relationships with people and communities, which are so important when facing immense challenges. Specifically, I'm thinking about spending more time with my friends in Manila and Baguio as well as revisiting the HEAL farm this year.\n\n### Sustenance\n\nMy main intention this year in this area of my life is to get really, really good at editing. This means getting good at grammar and the ins and outs of the trade. Editing is my main source of income and it does not rob me of the energy I use in my personal creative projects, which involve a lot of writing. It's only reasonable that I give it the attention it deserves and be the best editor I can be.\n\n### Meaning\n\nI intend to do a lot more drawing this year. Drawing is a passion I want to do a lot when I was a child. I learned to draw even before I started reading or writing. In grade school, I would admire classmates who were very good at drawing anime. I tried drawing anime myself and before long, some classmates would pay me to draw for them. Later, I created my own characters, bought composition notebooks, divided them in panels, and drew comics spontaneously. Sadly, none of those composition notebooks survived, although I can still remember some of the characters and scenes I drew back then.\n\nAs I grew up, I got deeper into writing and got out of touch with drawing. I did try cartooning for my high school newspaper and drawing illustrations for the Deaf when I was a pastor in college, but that was that. No animes, no elaborate stories, no comics.\n\nBy the end of 2019, I finally got the chance to relearn how to draw. My biggest motivator in this decision was [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/) and my distant mentor is [Lynda Barry](https://thenearsightedmonkey.tumblr.com/), a Filipino-Norwegian artist whose philosophy of drawing aligns much with my general life philosophy—let go of the rules, just do it!\n\nIf you are curious to see some of my drawings, [click here](https://www.instagram.com/vinceimbat/).\n\nI intend to continue drawing in 2020 and mishmash this with the other crafts I'm exploring like storytelling, poetry, fantasy, etc.\n\n## Bonus Question: What did I learn this year?\n\nTo end my annual review, I'm sharing with you five important lessons I learned in 2019.\n\n**\"Health is essentially the same as life. The end of life is the end of health.\"** This is a quote from my favorite philosopher [Steve Patterson](http://steve-patterson.com/). This is perhaps my biggest lesson in 2019. It's actually the biggest lesson of my entire life since 2011! For some reason, I need to continuously relearn it. When life is really good, we get too hung up in tweaking things like productivity, income, even creativity, when none of that really matters if we're sick or disabled. At the end of the day, health is the most important determinant of our overall happiness. If we could dedicate our time and attention to only one thing, it should be health. No questions asked.\n\n**Actions that are repeated and that turn into habits are the compound interest of life.** This is a lesson I learned from Atomic Habits but it is a lesson I needed to apply to fully understand. In 2019, I dedicated a lot of time to my creative routines in the morning, afternoon, and evening. These routines led to a lot of poems, journal entries, and philosophical realizations. I consider these routines my biggest achievements in 2019.\n\n**Hearing is more important than we usually assume.** Getting an ear infection and developing tinnitus has a very, very large impact on my current life. If I learned to value my hearing earlier, I could've prevented a lot of suffering I experienced in recent weeks. If you use cotton buds to clean your ears, stop! If you're fond of loud music, stop! Protect your ears before it's too late.\n\n**Drawing can be relearned.** This is another lesson I need to learn by \"doing\". I dreamt and theorized a lot about how I'll go about relearning this lost passion of mine. But until I bought a nice pen and some twistable crayons and started drawing, I never really believed that I could draw again.\n\n**We'll find love if we wait, we give it a chance, and we remember our own frailties.** Since going through a breakup in 2018, I started building my life back to the point where I was confident to go back to dating again. After failing twice, I finally found someone with whom I have strong chemistry. We were both avid diarists, we love introspection, and we're both interested in bettering ourselves. Despite this, we also came from very different backgrounds and possessed contrasting personality traits. I could say that I am currently at a place where I'm in a relationship with someone who is a source of encouragement during this tough time in my life and of inspiration to not stop dreaming and flourishing whatever the odds. I don't think this would have been possible if I didn't learn to wait for the right person, to practice compassion, and to develop the willingness to accept the frailties of others remembering that I myself have my own frailties.\n",

    "title": "My 2019 Musical Diaries",
    "content": "![My 2019 Musical Diary](My-2019-Musical-Diary.png)\n\nAside from tracking [my reading](/reading/), I also tracked my listening this 2019. Tracking what music I listen to achieve two things:\n\n1. It made me want to discover new music regularly.\n2. It showed me my taste of music.\n\nThe idea for creating a musical diary came from this post from [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/2018/12/20/musical-diaries/). Following his example, I created two new playlists on Spotify at the beginning of 2019. I named the first playlist just \"2019\"...\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/2A03RdcU54LWVGlN1vQCC8?si=zYrdaEe5Sc2JVSJK6Hv4aA\n\nand the second, \"OPM 2019\".\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/7AYEtNdTCNqgMAUcCU3EC7?si=cKQ5-7PS_mrqT1auhCSdw\n\nEvery time I listened to a new song or an old favorite, I saved the song to either playlist. If it's a song by a Filipino artist, it goes to \"OPM 2019\". If it's from an international artist, it goes to \"2019\". This way, I was able to make sure I was listening to both local and international music.\n\nIt was personally enlightening to know that I listened to a wide variety of genres. However, I really found close affinity with songs that were written as standalone poems like those by Bill Callahan, Gil Scott-Heron, Bullet Dumas, Hozier, and Nick Cave.\n\nYesterday, before I started washing the dishes, I opened Spotify and created two new playlists: \"2020\" and \"OPM 2020\". I played the new Munimuni version of \"Minsan\". After listening to it (and liking it), I stopped washing, cleaned my hands, and added the song to \"OPM 2020\" thus beginning my first musical diary of the decade.\n",

    "title": "My 2020 Annual Review",
    "content": "\n![Trees in UP](UP-Trees.jpg)\n\nDoing an annual review is an important part of my year. Once published, annual reviews can serve as [[Cairns to Mark the Journey|cairns to mark the journey of life]].\n\nThis year, I streamlined my process to make it more efficient. I wanted to put more intention into doing this because I will only do a few of them in my lifetime. I started doing them in 2013 when I was just 20 years old. If I continue to do them until I am 80 years old, I would be lucky to finish 52 more annual reviews. While I am strong and my memory is better, I would like to make the most of this yearly practice.\n\nSince [[My 2019 Annual Review|2019]], I have been asking myself four questions to perform my annual review:\n\n1. What went well this year?\n2. What didn’t go so well this year?\n3. What am I working toward?\n4. What did I learn this year?\n\nI answer the first three questions for the four big areas of my life: health, relationships, sustenance (my financial and material life), and meaning (my vocation and art).\n\nSince this post is long overdue, let’s get right into it. Here is my 2020 annual review.\n\n## What went well this year?\n\n### Health\n\nMy single biggest achievement in this area is taking care of whatever hearing is left to me so that my tinnitus does not increase in volume. Even more important is developing a healthier response to the noise, which eventually lead to habituation, or me getting used to the sound.\n\nThis is an important achievement as I consider my tinnitus similar (although less severe) than the biggest challenge I ever faced in my life: [[Seven Lessons I Learned Since My Depression In 2011|my 2011 depressive episode]]. More than a year since the ringing in my left ear started bothering me, I continue to cope with it. There are days when the sound seems louder than usual and, on these days, I sometimes ask myself when it will ever stop. But most days, I am able to function well and continue life as usual. I don’t even hear it sometimes, especially when I am so absorbed in whatever I am doing.\n\nThe second health achievement I am most proud of this year was losing 30 lbs or 13.6 kgs since starting a low-acid diet in August 2020. I was forced to do the diet after suffering from a throat problem caused by the reflux of stomach acid towards my upper esophagus. This condition is called Laryngopharyngeal reflux or LPR. To heal my throat, I needed to heal the sphincter that prevents the stomach acid to reflux into my esophagus. For this to happen, I needed to take some medications, remove acidic food in my diet temporarily, and lose weight. The diet I followed covered the last two goals. I ate only foods with pH levels 7 and above. As an added bonus, these foods also helped me lose weight.\n\nFollowing this diet meant giving up intermittent fasting, which is a habit I established last year and which, I considered my most important health goal back then. It is clear now that intermittent fasting wasn’t helping me control my weight (in fact, I was obese before my LPR) and, worse, it was messing up with my stomach acids. Today, I eat smaller but frequent meals and it has worked well for me.\n\n### Relationships\n\nInterestingly, the pandemic had a reverse effect on my relationship with Lea, my girlfriend. While it forced us to be apart (something we are thankful is finally over), our relationship actually thrive within those 300 days we were separated. Don’t get us wrong, being separated was not good for us; it would have destroyed us if it went further. However, a benefit of the separation was that it forced us to think creatively in maintaining our bond while away from each other. It created good habits that we still do even if we’re already together in person.\n\nDuring those 300 days we were apart, we had daily conversations in the evenings. We only missed a few, when I wasn’t at home. But most days, we would talk for about two hours each night. During our calls, we would play (thanks Houseparty!), review our day, settle problems, sing, write poems, and draw. Most importantly, the daily conversations helped us understand each other better. We were able to develop honesty and respect in our communication—something that isn’t easy not only because of the long-distance situation but also because of our personalities.\n\nAside from building my relationship with Lea, I was also able to build new relationships this year. This was primarily through [Tungko ng Tula](https://tungkongtula.com/), a community of poets that was started by [Rem Tanauan](https://www.instagram.com/ditomuna/) after the nationwide quarantine rolled out. Last December 30, 2020, the two batches of Tungko had a year-ender and one of the alumni, Cris Garcimo, used the word “_daloy_” (flow) to describe his experience of friendship in the community. Through Tungko, he met new friends, who, in turn, connected him with other friends. For him, Tungko became a critical node that opened up lots of streams of friendships. He was basically describing my own experience of Tungko. Through Tungko, I met interesting and genuine individuals, who, in turn, were connected with larger communities of like-minded and like-hearted people. The community made me feel less alone in 2020, a year when loneliness was at a record high worldwide.\n\nWhile I built new friendships, I was also able to nurture existing friendships. The pandemic deepened my relationships with a few close friends. Losing physicla connection encouraged many of us to seek alternative ways to connect via the Internet. If done right, these can actually be really great temporary replacements to physical connections. The pandemic forced me to start daily, weekly, and monthly habits that connect me to loved ones (a Zoom call with my sister tonight, another with cousins tomorrow, a weekly catchup with an accountability group every Wednesday, etc.) I wish that these habits will remain even after the pandemic.\n\n### Sustenance\n\nObviously, the pandemic was not easy for a lot of people’s finances and for the economy in general. However, like any disaster, the pandemic also proved to be a great wake up call for most people’s business and work life. Perhaps one of the pandemic’s most important lessons is that online-based work is more lockdown-proof than industries that rely heavily on physical contact. This is something I am very grateful for.\n\nWhile the pandemic led to economic loses, many of which were caused primarily by the sometimes excessive restrictions imposed on individuals and businesses to prevent the further spread of the disease, some industries were not profoundly hit. For example, students and academics continued their studies online and the influx of editing assignments I received have been consistently stable. This meant that I was in a good position to help family members, friends, and volunteer organizations as they coped with the economic effects of the pandemic.\n\nIn a previous post [[How I Became a Professional Multipotentialite|\"How I Became a Professional Multipotentialite\"]], I also showed that I have massively cut my working hours because of my new editing job. This is probably the best thing that happened to me in this area last year. This meant more free time for me to do projects that are not necessarily income-generating but are more aligned to what I want to do.\n\n### Meaning\n\nLiving a meaningful life in 2020 was obviously challenging because of the pandemic. The biggest drawback for this year was that there was very little travel possible. Traveling was a big part of my life before the pandemic as most of the people I care about are far from me. Despite this, the restrictions, again, encouraged us to be more creative: we all needed to find ways to feel alive even when we were socially isolated. And that was what I did.\n\nThis year, I really dove into poetry. Most of the [books](/reading/) I read this year were poetry books, and I finished the nine-week poetry master class, Tungko ng Tula. Reading and writing poetry led me to tinker with newspaper blackout poetry, which I immediately fell in love with. I tried it in English newspapers, Pangasinan magazines, and Filipino tabloids. Writing poetry was also the most social thing I did this year as it connected me with other poet friends. As a contribution to our community, I volunteered to design our [website](https://tungkongtula.com/).\n\nLast 2019, I started going back to an old passion: drawing. And this year, I continued to draw. When the pandemic started, Robert Alejandro began a series of daily art classes. I joined one of these classes, and that started my drawing journey in 2020. I drew a series of blind contour drawings featuring Filipino comedians and personalities then international authors. I also drew my friends when they celebrated their birthdays.\n\nIn 2020, I also launched [Mantaltaliwa](https://mantaltaliwa.substack.com/), a Pangasinan newsletter that featured some of my Pangasinan poems and translations. I see it as my small contribution to the project of revitalizing and saving our dying mother tongue. I also started uploading videos I took while walking and riding my bike in Nature on YouTube and sharing these in my project [Worn out Wheels](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuCCQkNNZjVxbgjBpRTtaRQ).\n\nBut perhaps my biggest creative project in 2020 was immersing in Thoreau’s words. [I read his entire journal for one year](/what-i-learned-from-a-year-of-reading-thoreaus-journal/), [translated entries that resonated with me into Filipino](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vithoreau/), shared these translations in social media, created a workshop on his life and creative processes, and tried out his field work process for about a month. Doing all these had a strong effect on my life as a writer as Thoreau taught me how to become truer to myself and to the things that really matter to me.\n\nAside from Thoreau, my biggest win this year was establishing a minimum viable life system. Starting in July 2020, I started exploring [Caroline Miller](https://www.carolinemiller.com/)’s goal-setting work book, which I coupled with [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/)’s Annual Review process, which I converted into a mid-year review. Moving forward, I started learning a lot from Tiago’s work and built my own life management system, which totally changed how I function in a daily basis. The life system I established this year solved the problems I was struggling with for many years, and it has profoundly improved my sanity. It is still a work in progress. For example, this year, I moved from Evernote (the main app I was using) to [Craft](https://www.craft.do/), which was a more beautiful note-taking app that has most of the things I need. I also streamlined my annual review process to be more efficient. I’ll be sharing more about my system in the future. \n\n## What didn’t go so well this year?\n\n### Health\n\nMy tinnitus started bothering me in January 1, 2020, but that issue started back in 2019. It got bad because of a series of mistakes I made last 2019. While 2020 was the year it started bothering me, it was also the year of recovering from it—searching for help, trying out different therapies, finding what might help me, and sticking to what works.\n\nWhat really went bad for me in 2020 in terms of my health was the Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) I suffered starting August. LPR is when stomac acid travels up into the esophagus and eats up the throat. The most prominent symptom was a sensation of a fishbone in my throat, but I occassionally, I also experienced difficulty of breathing.\n\nLike my tinnitus, and like all other health issues, my LPR was the culmination of a lot of bad eating habits and choices: it probably started when I began intermittent fasting, which created extreme hunger, which gave me the license to overeat during meals. Because of overeating, I gained a lot of weight, leading to obesity, which placed a lot of pressure on my sphincter.\n\nObviously, things got better for me when I started correcting my diet, but good eating habits from the start could have prevented this health issue.\n\n### Relationships\n\nThere were two things that didn’t go well for me in this area last 2020. First, my relationship with my younger sister got strained. We were not used to living in the same house—a reality we had to face after she was forced to stay with us indefinitely because of the pandemic. The differences between our personalities got out of hand and we arrived into a mutual understanding that we can no longer live in the ame house for that long again. I believe things will get better in the future. But for now, this is my reality, and I have learned to be comfortable with it.\n\nAnother thing that I think was a failure in this area was the death of two of our pets. While I have already made peace with this, I still believe I could have done better to prevent what happened. It was a learning experience. I became a more mindful pet owner after it. Now that I transferred to Laguna, I have decided not to keep pets for the time being, knowing how large a responsibility they actually are (and should be).\n\n### Sustenance\n\nWhile I am grateful that this is an area of my life that is currently stable, I am also aware that I am not yet as resilient as I possibly can. I still need to establish alternative sources of income so that I have a financial safety net.\n\n### Meaning\n\nAfter doing Tiago Forte’s Annual Review, which I turned into a mid-year review, the biggest thing I realized from the process was that I was not really setting big, scary goals for myself. I was playing it safe. I wasn’t taking any risks. I forgave myself for this especially because 2020 was a particularly difficult year. But this 2021, I challenge myself to step up—to really do the work that I am called to do and to take more risks and expose myself to more challenges.\n\n## What am I working towards?\n\n### Health\n\nAfter going through a strict diet, I now have lost 30 lbs or 13.6 kgs. This was a big personal achievement, but it is still beyond my ideal weight. For the first quarter of 2021, I would like to achieve a more normal weight by dropping from 192.7 lbs (current) to 178 lbs, which means I have to lose 14.7 more lbs in about seven weeks. I would like to achieve this healthily and sustainably through healthy eating habits and regular physical activity.\n\nAside from this, my other goals are:\n\n- I would like to totally prevent another onset of LPR.\n- I would like to help my eardrum close to about 75% of its hole.\n- I would like to continue tapering my psych meds this entire year without experiencing adverse effects.\n\nOverall, my intention for 2021 is not to have a serious health issue caused by my lifestyle choices. I would like to train myself to make better health choices every day.\n\n### Relationships\n\nMy 2020 was a relationship-filled year, even when I was mostly isolated from people. I was able to build ties with new and old friends online. Now that I recently moved to Los Baños, I am looking forward to actually nurturing more of those relationships. I am also looking forward to being more intentional on the relationships that I build, hoping that they will support the mission I am pursuing.\n\n### Sustenance\n\nFor the past years, I have followed the books _Your Money or Your Life_ (YMOYL) and _Early Retirement Extreme_ (ERE) in thinking about and managing my money. While I still subscribe to the practices taught by these books, I have a growing curiosity on what alternative systems exist out there. I have read that [Paul Jarvis](https://pjrvs.com/), for example, does not resonate with the Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) tradition that both YMOYL and ERE espouse. I wonder why that is the case.\n\nThis year, I would like to revisit my beliefs about money and restructure a system that works for me and helps me manage my financial goals and actions. In addition to this, I would like to look for another source of stable income, which will serve as my safety net in case editing projects come slow. I would also like to reconsider entrepreneurship so that I can align money-making with something I actually enjoy doing. Hopefully, I could be able to launch a product to test in the market before the year ends.\n\n### Meaning\n\nThis 2021, as I am transitioning in a new place, I want to listen more to what my true self is telling me to pursue. Righ now, it is telling me to fully commit to developing my life system and philosophy of living further. To do this, I will have to establish a note-writing system—a daily practice of developing ideas into succinct, individual notes in the tradition of Niklas Luhmann’s zettelkasten and [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/)’s evergreen notes. I am considering publishing these notes as Borradores.\n\nMy hope is that through a daily practice of developing atomic ideas, I would sharpen my thinking so that I am more open to insight. My goal is to produce at least 300 fully developed notes. I have been dipping my toes in philosophy for the past three years. I think I am now ready to fully commit to this pursuit of truth and Ginhawa. This 2021, I would like to take more risks, to aim for scarier goals, as I thread through this field. To support me in this goal, I would also like to connect with people who are in a similar journey—pursuing truth and constructing their own philosophy of living as independent thinkers.\n\nAside from this, I also expect to finish translating all my favorite Thoreau journal quotes. By the end of 2021, I am hoping to have a first draft manuscript of Ang Talaarawan ni Thoreau, a collection con devotional of Thoreau journal quotes in Filipino.\n\n## What did I learn this year?\n\nTo end my annual review, I’m going to share to you several of the most important insights and lessons I learned in 2020.\n\n**You may not be able to change something, but you can change your reaction to it.** This is something I have already learned in the past. But once in a while, I need a tragedy to relearn it. Going through tinnitus, one thing that helped me cope with it mentally was when I realized that it was important for me to differentiate actions I can take to lessen the noise and actions I can take to improve my reaction to it. When I realized I can do a few things to lessen the noise (sleeping better, eating better, relaxing more) but not completely eliminate it, I was able to focus more on reducing my anxiety to it.\n\n**Set scarier goals.** Nothing is as awakening as realizing that you have played it safe for a long time. But this is what I realized the moment I did a mid-year review. My goals weren't really scary enough to help me grow. While I still believe that the little things are what matters most, I also need challenges, once in a while, to help me learn more about myself. This year, I have set goals that are intentionally designed to help me grow.\n\n**You need a life system**, not just a life philosophy. For a long time, I thought that what I was really building was a philosophy of living. However, as I was fixing my productivity system and information management system, I realized that a total integrated life management system is the ultimate project, and life philosophy is simply a part of that. Realizing that helped me define my priorities better.\n\n**You need project deadlines.** I started putting deadlines on every goal and every project that I set. The deadlines are not fixed, strict, structural boundaries but rather reminders of what I can accomplish in a given time period. If I need more time, I simply use the deadline as a review time to redefine my thoughts on the project. \n\n**Reframe all setbacks as challenges.** There are no setbacks; only challenges. This has been a life-changing lesson for me in 2020, something that really helped me cope with everything that made the year unusually difficult. I thank William B. Irvine's book _The Stoic Challenge_ for reiterating this lesson to me.\n\n**Happiness is generated by small actions, not big projects.** After building my minimum viable system, I thought I would be the happiest person in the world. That was not the case. In fact, I felt an unexplained emptiness. This made me realize that one does not need a life system to be happy. It helps one be happy, but the heavy lifting comes in the form of habits and little actions that raise our overall well-being.\n\nAnd with that, I close another chapter of my life. Thank you 2020, and welcome 2021!\n",

    "title": "My 2021 Annual Review",
    "content": "\n![Laguna lake](Laguna-lake.jpeg)\n\nIn the last nine-ish years, I have published an [annual review](/annual-review/). In recent years, I used three questions to guide my review:\n\n1. What went well this year?\n2. What didn’t go so well this year?\n3. What am I working toward?\n\nI picked these questions from James Clear.\n\n[[My 2020 Annual Review|Last year]], I added a fourth:\n\n4. What did I learn this year?\n\nIn 2021, I learned a lot about building a life management system that I decided to use an entirely different template to write this review. This article is the culmination of a week-long process of reflecting on the past year and the aggregation of tiny reviews I did throughout 2021.\n\nThe process goes this way:\n\n1. I use five major life areas to review (life system, physical health, mental health, relationships, sustenance, life work).\n2. On each life area, I review the goals I set last year and review whether or not I accomplished them and why.\n3. Then, I share the other goals and projects that emerged throughout last year on that particular area.\n4. Finally, I share the new goals I set on each area.\n\nLet’s dive right into it.\n\n## Life management system\n\n**Develop life system and philosophy.** Setting this goal in 2021 was me telling myself I want to pursue philosophy. I want to use my mind and life as the center of my life work. Little did I know that a life system—which I now more accurately call a “life management system”—is an intricate thing built slowly. A life philosophy is even more complex as I need to continue to ask myself whether or not such a thing is even needed to live a good life. This is a goal I wasn't able to achieve in 2021 nor will I achieve it in 2022. It is a work for a lifetime. What I was able to do this year was articulate the concept of a life management system better and try things out for myself. One of these is establishing a note-writing system.\n\n**Establish a note-writing system and develop at least 300 fully developed notes.** This was perhaps my biggest achievement in 2021. I was able to establish a minimum viable zettelkasten system and practice I modified and called Talahardin. This system also involved establishing a daily note-writing practice, which I was able to consistently perform most days of the year when I wasn't working. I continued to dedicate time practicing, using, researching, and improving this system. That said, I wasn’t able to arrive at 300 notes. I am currently below 200. I realize along the way that the system will inevitably grow in size, but it should happen organically and there has to be a premium on quality over quantity.\n\nOverall, I am happy about what I achieve in this area. This area is perhaps the area I really worked on last year that I am quite surprised I am only able to list three achievements here. This only shows that building a life management system takes time and dedication, and the process for getting it right is something we cannot hasten.\n\nOther goals in this area that came to me this year:\n\n- I was able to improve my digital security this year. This was a reaction to a card fraud event that happened to me in 2020, which was, thankfully, averted. I took action in securing my digital passwords, installing a VPN, and purchasing an antimalware software.\n\nMy goal for this area in 2022 consists of one thing:\n\n- I want to articulate my purpose, values, and big picture vision for my life to make it easier for me to make decisions.\n\n## Physical heath\n\n**Get to normal weight.** Entering 2021, I set a goal to achieve a normal weight dropping from 192.7 lbs to 178 lbs in the first quarter. This meant losing 14.7 lbs in about seven weeks. I failed terribly in this goal. Not only did I not achieve my goal, I even increased my weight at the end of the year. By December 31, I was 196.4 lbs. I tried to implement good eating habits when I transferred to Los Baños earlier this year and that actually led to the lowest and closest weight I had to my goal on March 27, 2021. That day, I weighed 182.5 lbs—4.5 lbs short of my goal. From that day, however, I increased my weight, decreasing once more around June but increasing around October. Maintaining a healthy weight is difficult and I seriously need to do more reflection on what worked or did not work for me in this project.\n\n**Prevent LPR onset.** LPR stands for laryngopharyngeal reflux, a condition where acid and contents of the stomach return to the esophagus and throat where they wreak havoc. I suffered from LPR in 2020, which was the original impetus for losing weight. In 2021, I was determined to prevent another relapse so that my throat could heal. I had several LPR relapses, but nothing serious and by about November to December this year, I almost can't feel the tear in my throat. I was definitely able to improve my digestion through avoiding unhealthy foods, eating more probiotics, especially yogurt, and taking supplements like essential enzymes and pepsin.\n\n**Heal eardrum perforation.** I would admit that among the health goals I set last 2021, this was the most difficult and perhaps even impossible. According to studies, there is a very slight chance that an adult’s eardrum with a large perforation caused by infection would heal back on its own. But due to the possible complications of the surgery, one of which is the possible worsening of my tinnitus, I chose to wait and delay. I was already habituating to my tinnitus that I didn't see the need for surgery for it to get better. I was afraid to make my tinnitus worse that I could not habituate to it so I opted to wait and see if the eardrum heals back. My goal was to only help heal my eardrum to close to about 75%. I was only able to heal my eardrum back to about 50%.\n\nOther goals in this area that came to me this year:\n\n- I was able to establish a daily walking habit early in January 2021. This was to compensate with the bike rides I used to have in Pangasinan. Walking not only became my main form of exercise; it has now become an integral part of my life work.\n- I was able to establish a simple system for purchasing and cooking my own food. I learned several recipes myself. It isn’t perfect though, and I need to do a better job eating the right food.\n\nOverall, my intention entering 2021 was not to have a serious health issue as I experienced in 2020. Although I am not yet fully healed from all my health issues, I enjoyed a generally healthy existence throughout 2021, so I think I succeeded in achieving the general standard of this life area.\n\nMy main physical health goals this 2022 are:\n\n- To establish a better sleeping habit (eight hours a day from 11 PM to 7 AM).\n- To establish a healthy, sustainable, time-efficient, and cost-effective nutrition system that will improve my overall well-being.\n- To have my throat completely heal.\n\n## Mental health\n\n**Tapering antidepressant.** This is a goal I was able to achieve. I continued to take half a pill of the only antidepressant I have been taking (sertraline) since my diagnosis in 2011 without experiencing adverse effects. I am ready to continue with the tapering and reduce my dosage further to a quarter of a pill for another year.\n\nOther goals in this area that came to me this year:\n\n- After almost two months of surveying, I found the perfect apartment to settle in in Los Baños. Located in a quiet neighborhood, I am currently enjoying peaceful neighbors and fresh air at the foot of Mt. Makiling. This space has profoundly improved my mental health and creative energy.\n- After settling it, I did my best to make the house liveable and established systems to maintain and manage it. It was challenging to maintain a larger space given that I was alone (with my cats). But I learned a lot living by myself.\n- I have built a workspace that supports my creative work. I invested on a 24” monitor, a standing desk, and an ergonomic chair. These three are the best purchases I made in 2021.\n\nOverall, I am definitely happy with my general mental health. There were down days, of course. I usually feel blue during the start of the rainy season. But my mental health improved by a notch for two reasons: a nurturing environment and proximity to friends.\n\nMy mental health goals this 2022 are:\n\n- To further taper my sertraline dosage to 1/4 pill a day.\n- To transform my simple abode into a welcoming home for the important people in my life—people who I invite for meaningful and transformational conversations and camaraderie.\n\n## Relationships\n\n**Nurturing more relationships.** This is an area of my life in which I think I made a lot of progress this year. I took the PERMA test when I got to Los Baños around the first quarter and compared it to my results from 2020 and I noticed a steeped rise in my happiness level due to a subjective satisfaction in my relationships. In Los Baños I was able to meet new friends and establish closer relationships with old friends. These relationships, in turn, challenged me and encouraged me in thinking about my life work and the life I want to build in general.\n\n**Building relationships to help me in my life work.** I wasn't able to accomplish this because I realized early on that I have to articulate to myself first what kind of work exactly I want to accomplish. That will help me identify the exact people to connect to.\n\nOther goals in this area that came to me this year:\n\n- I transferred to Los Baños, which profoundly improved my relationships. I have great neighbors, great friends, and I am closer to Lear while I’m here.\n- I was able to make my apartment more welcoming to my new friends and hosted one event.\n- While staying in my transient space, I was visited by two stray cats. I fed them and that is why they returned. I was simply reciprocating how LB people are treating their animals. When I was about to transfer to my new place, I decided to bring them with me. I am happy with my decision—although sometimes regret it when I call Champy and she doesn’t come.\n- Speaking of pets, my oldest dog Doji died in Pangasinan while I was away. This actually prompted me to finally visit home after eight months. I decided to transition Kako, my other dog back there, to organic food to improve her health.\n- More on pets: I learned how to solve a flea infestation after we had a bad one last November.\n- I was able to make large strides in my relationship with Lea. I met her mom and relatives. I was able to introduce her to mine. Everything is really going well with the two of us.\n\nMy relationship goals in 2022 are:\n\n- To help Lea be accountable to her goal of saving for her emergency fund.\n- To support Lea in her goal of becoming her healthiest self.\n- To articulate for myself clearly what kind of people I want to bring into my life and inner circle.\n- To proactively search for my ideal people and nurture my relationships with them.\n- To reunite my entire family at least once this year.\n\n## Sustenance\n\n**Reviewing my beliefs on money.** Early in 2021, I wanted to see if there are other ideas aside from those I learned from Your Money or Your Life and Early Retirement Extreme that could guide how I see personal finance. I wasn't able to pursue this project because I focused on setting the foundation for the more basic and obvious changes in my current resource management system.\n\n**Restructure my resource management system.** I call it a resource management system instead of a financial management system because I see that the non-financial materials that we use in our lives are tightly connected with how we use our money. In 2021, I put a lot of time into setting up the foundation for a better system. First, I transferred all my emergency funds to online banks, which have higher interest rates than normal banks. Bye, bye BPI and EastWest. Hello CIMB and Tonik! Next, I learned passive investing and invested the majority of my savings to both the Philippine Stock Market and the international stock markets. I'm totally new in the game, but I am happy to have started.\n\n**Look for a second source of stable income.** I was making enough money as a freelance English editor by the beginning of 2021, but the resilience thinking I learned from reading ERE convinced me that I need to start or look for a second source of income that could compensate for my main source in the case, for an unforeseen event, that source disappears. Unfortunately, I was too preoccupied with the previous goal that I lost steam on this one.\n\n**Reconsider entrepreneurship to find sustenance work closer to joy.** I wasn't able to follow through with this goal because I was exposed to the patronage model many times in 2021: Andy Matuschak, Craig Mod, and Hundred Rabbits. I decided to explore the patronage model. I contemplated whether establishing patrons instead of a business would suit me better. I am convinced that it would, given the nature of the work I want to do. However, it seems a more difficult thing to build than a business and so I remain open to either.\n\nOther goals in this area that came to me this year:\n\n- I studied insurance and bought myself an HMO card for the first time.\n- I built my own financial tracker through spreadsheets and transfer my monthly financial review there.\n- I started exploring the idea of outsourcing my editing work to someone\n\nMy sustenance goals in 2022 are:\n\n- To create a budgeting system to use every month, while I haven’t yet improve my financial system.\n- To reevaluate my understanding, values, and general philosophy of money and the material world.\n- To reevaluate my editing work and decide whether to improve my editing skills or learn a new skill altogether.\n- To reevaluate whether to outsource my editing work or not.\n- To find a second source of stable income online.\n- To invest in high risk, high reward investment instruments.\n- To learn Linux and consider an opensource lifestyle.\n\n## Life work\n\n**Connect with independent thinkers building their own philosophical systems.** My transfer to Los Baños sucked me into the local community of artists and creatives. Although I enjoy our camaraderie, there is no denying that I need a community that is exactly parallel with the work I want to build (contemplation and philosophy). I was able to establish a friendship with one such person in 2021, even started a dialogue with him. But this isn't enough. Being an introvert, socialization is not really my strong suit and I need to exert more effort to put a dent in this goal.\n\n**Have a first draft manuscript of my translation of Thoreau’s journals.** I wasn't able to achieve this goal. But I like it that way. Thoreau has been a profound influence on how I see the world and live my life that going back to his works and slowly doing the translation is the pace I want to take. I did manage to do many translations in 2021. But I will not force myself to release a book. I plan on building a site of my translations though (Update: I have done this! Check out the site at [kaliskisnaulap.com](https://kaliskisnaulap.com/)).\n\nOther goals in this area that came to me this year:\n\n- I was able to revisit all my past notes about my life work and uncovered important data on my tendencies and preferences. I have started to define my life work better. I am not completely there but I am making progress (link to notes on life work)\n- In 2021, I commemorated the 10th year of my depressive episode—the single most life-changing experience I had. I released a series of vignettes about my episode, which I later discontinued.\n- I released two seasons of a newsletter I called [Lilim](/lilim/). It was the first newsletter I was able to consistently release weekly (except for twice I think). It was a newsletter inspired by my new love of walking, my never-ending philosophical questions, and my desire to improve my voice as a writer.\n- I deepened my photography skills. I took a course in iPhone photography, joined [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/)’s membership club for a month, read the [Teju Cole](https://www.nytimes.com/by/teju-cole)’s column in the New York Times, and went to lots of walks to take photos. I volunteered to document events and took portraits of my friends. Learning photography has been one of the most fulfilling experiences I had in 2021.\n- I took lots of walks. Almost everyday, I walked. I discovered every little street in Los Baños and went to several longer walks discovering new places in town.\n- My research on Zettelkasten, knowledge management, and life management has really deepen that I was able to create and conduct a workshop.\n\nMy life work goals in 2022 are:\n\n- To study web design and create a new minimum viable design for vinceimbat.com.\n- To study web development to apply the new design for vinceimbat.com.\n- To learn coding.\n- To continue translating a sizable amount of Thoreau’s journal quotes.\n- To build a website for my Thoreau translations.\n- To establish a regular habit of reaching out and conversing with my ideal audience: audience, peers, and mentors.\n- To research individuals who asked the question “How to Live?” and have studied how they study, live, share, connect, and facilitate their ideas to others.\n- To clearly articulate my Talahardin system using inspiration from Zettelkasten, Evergreen note-taking system, and BASB.\n- To design a beta version of an app for my Talahardin.\n- To plan, perform, and write about at least one long philosophical walk.\n",

    "title": "My Daily Creative Learning Spiral",
    "content": "\n![Creative learning spiral](creative-learning-spiral.jpg)\n\nThis is my own drawing of Mitchel Resnick's Creative Learning Spiral from his book _[Lifelong Kindergarten](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/lifelong-kindergarten)_. It is an illustration of how kindergarteners learn, which, according to Resnick is also how all human beings, regardless of age, should learn.\n\nI tried reflecting on the spiral and comparing it to my own daily creative routine, and this is what I came up with:\n\n![Daily creative learning spiral](daily-creative-learning-spiral.jpg)\n\nIn my drawing, I included when the phases usually happen (morning, afternoon, evening) as well as specific activities I do under each phase. What I realized from drawing my own spiral is that I don't necessarily follow the order of Resnick's phases, but they are definitely there. I usually imagine when I consume and engage with inspirations (books, articles, movies, songs, etc.). Almost immediately, especially with [translation](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vithoreau/), I am able to create—to write something that is my own.\n\nPlay is usually separate from creation as I use it as a form of recreation (i.e., rest from the act of creation). Recently, I've been trying to incorporate play in my creative process itself by allowing myself to tinker around and follow where my interest will bring me. I've also tried experimenting with art forms that are intentionally meant to surprise the artist like blind contour drawings and newspaper blackout poetry.\n\nI share through this blog, my newsletter, and social media. But sometimes, I just share with my close friends. And I reflect when I go back to my journal entries, revisit old or recent blog posts, and list my highlights of the month and year so I can review what I have paid attention to.\n\nThat admin part of my spiral is a reminder that I am old. There are things I need to do to function in the adult world as I do my best to continue living as a lifelong kindergartener.\n",

    "title": "My Hero Books of 2019",
    "content": "![My Hero Books of 2019](Hero_Books_2019.jpg)\n\nIt was a great reading year for me. I started tracking my reading this year after seeing this page from [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/reading/). I also tried remembering the books I read since 2015. [[library|My list]] is incomplete because I forgot a lot of books I read, but it's near accurate, and it clearly shows I read more books this 2019 than any other year that came before it. James Clear was right: [what gets tracked, gets improved](https://jamesclear.com/habit-tracker).\n\nAll-in-all, I read 18 books. I know it's far from the lists of the likes of [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/category/my-reading-years/) (who reads 100+ books a year!), but I am proud of what I accomplished with my reading habit this year. I don't really consider myself a fast reader, and I don't think I want to be one. When I love a book, especially when it's highly practical, I write a summary of it, which involves going back to each chapter of the book and really analyzing its main points. I remember the book easier that way, and I enjoy the process very much.\n\nThis post features the best books I read this year, including the main reasons why I love them so much. The list is arranged in descending order, starting with my most favorite of the year.\n\n## Henry David Thoreau: A Life | Laura Dassow Walls\n\nLaura Dassow Wall's biography of one of the most eclectic writers of all time was my best read of the year. It's one of the books that are just so immersive. I have an eye for biographies because I was exposed to them in college. I know what good historiography is. But Dassow Walls' biography was entirely different and unique from all the academic biographies I've read. She writes as if she's in a quest to answer the same questions that Thoreau asked himself—and, actually, she was! She also writes poetically and she has a taste for creative literary tools—there are cliffhangers all over the book creating suspense at the end of sections, making you want to read more of what could've been a very boring book.\n\nI felt very, very close to Thoreau while reading this biography. I read it in the morning, then I read it in the evening, and every time I read it, I was spending time with a great master of the art of living. My creative life will never be the same. In Thoreau's life, I found an affirmation of the things that I have already been doing in my relationship with the material world and my relationship with my art. Thoreau also provides a model for me to follow.\n\nMy favorite part of the book was Laura's description of Thoreau's final moments. I can still picture in my mind how the dying Thoreau lied down on his porch while passersby—both young and old, even children—came by to pay their respects to a nation's treasure who is about to breathe his last. It was just powerful writing. I'm currently immersing myself in Thoreau's journal, reading his entries for each day. If I keep at it, I'll finish by December next year and his journal will definitely be part of next year's My Hero Books list.\n\n## Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life | Anne Lamott\n\nThis book was probably my first introduction to humorous writing in English. I really liked this style of writing a lot that I've begun reading Billy Collins' collection of poems _Sailing Alone in the Room_. I'm experimenting with my comedic voice both in my poetry and in recent explorations in drawings. Reading the book made me nostalgic about writers like Bob Ong and Eros Atalia—Filipino humor writers whose books I read in grade school and high school.\n\nWhat's most interesting about Anne Lamott's book is that it was also a book of writing lessons. So, Anne was basically teaching writing but through a comedic voice. It was very effective! If only teachers of all kinds could teach with fun and humor, things will be a lot easier for everyone—students, parents, taxpayers, politicians, even the teachers themselves!\n\nMy favorite lesson from Anne was her advice on how to avoid libel when writing about your ex:\n\n\u003e If you disguise this person carefully so that he cannot be recognized by the physical or professional facts of his life, you can use him in your work. And the best advice I can give you is to give him a teenie little penis so he will be less likely to come forth.\n\nHaha. Great advice from a great book! I highly recommend Anne's book.\n\n## Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career | Scott H. Young\n\nUltralearning by Scott H. Young sits right beside James Clear's Atomic Habits on the shelf of the most practical and actionable books I've read. James is a better writer than Scott (and Scott knows this), but his book was something I consulted many times throughout the year. His chapter on meta-learning was most useful to me. Although I'm also experimenting with spontaneous learning like what I'm currently doing with studying how to draw, Scott's meta-learning process was so useful in identifying the best learning paths to follow in several learning projects I did this year. Another piece of advice from the book which I have already internalized a lot in my life is the principle of directness. I didn't read a book on how to write poetry, I just wrote poetry. I didn't read a book on drawing, I just drew. I didn't use to do this. I would waste a lot of time planning for certain learning projects before engaging with the exact skills, tasks, and actions those projects involves. Today—and I owe some of this from Scott's book—I tend to dive immediately to an activity I want to do, and I am more comfortable with this.\n\n## Devotions: The Selected Poems of Mary Oliver | Mary Oliver**\n\nThis is only the second poetry collection book I finished reading. The first collection was the Alon poetry collection _What the Water Said_. Ever since I started writing poems, I also started reading 1-2 poems every morning. I started this poetry reading habit through Mary Oliver's _Devotions_.\n\n_Devotions_ was Mary Oliver's last book. It is a collection of her best poems which she handpicked herself. This collection inspired me to go out in nature more and write poems while there. I also copied the styles of some of her poems in a few poems of mine, like [[inbox/Tumawa ang Bantay]]. The book also made me feel closer to one of the human beings I really admire for just the way she lived. I'm hoping to read a biography of Mary Oliver one day.\n\n## Belong: Find Your People, Create Community, and Live a More Connected Life | Radha Agrawal\n\nCommunity, friendship, and relationship are subjects that fascinate me a lot—partly because I think I'm not that good at them and partly because I'm so bothered that too many people are not good at them and seem to be okay with that. They have their phones and social media, anyway.\n\nEarly this year, I scoured the Internet for book recommendations on community-building. I decided to pick Radha's book and invest time in it because of its systematic but not boring approach to community-building.\n\nThe book was also filled with a lot of doodles and drawings, which I really love. Interestingly, Radha's book was the same publisher who publishes Austin Kleon's drawing-filled books, Workman Publishing. Drawings just make learning so much easier.\n\nRadha's philosophy of community-building is bullet-proof: 1) Start with yourself. Get to know who you really are and what you really want. 2) Find people who share your values and build your community around them. Without inner work, building a community you actually love is impossible.\n\n## Other Great Reads\n\n- **The War of Art** by Steven Pressfield. A bit overrated. Steven's advice can be contradictory sometimes. Plus, the woo-woo element is just too much for my taste.\n- **Meditations** by Marcus Aurelius. Another overrated book. Or maybe I just read a bad translation by Robin Hard. In general, the book is just too old for our times and will only inspire those who already adhere to stoic ideas. Nevertheless, there definitely are gems of wisdom scattered around the book (and some funny metaphors too!).\n- **Influence** by Robert Cialdini. I listened to this as an audiobook. Enlightening but a bit overrated (again). The main points can be summarized in one page or even a single paragraph. The stories are fun though and they could help you remember the main points better.\n- **The Millionaire Fastlane** by MJ DeMarco. I read this after feeling my entrepreneurial itch late this year. Although I do not agree with a lot of MJ's views, I still think it's one of the most honest entrepreneurship books around and, therefore, every aspiring entrepreneur must read it.\n- **Beyond Morality** by Richard Garner. I included this in [[My hero books of 2018|my hero books last year]] but I actually finished reading it this year. One of my favorite books of all time.\n- **Ignore Everybody** by Hugh MacLeod. Hugh's advice can also be contradictory but his story is a gem. Every aspiring artist and creative must read Hugh's book.\n- **Company of One** by Paul Jarvis. I love Paul's work and I listened to his new book late this year. While Paul's views are really thought-provoking, unique, and brave, I find his book less practical than other business books. He has a course though that accompanies the book. I guess that's where you'll learn the specifics.\n- **The Art of Fully Living** by Tal Gur. Great kick of inspiration. Tal's story proves that the path to self-improvement can still (and must!) continue even when very challenging situations come our way.\n- **Keep Going** by Austin Kleon. Austin's last book in his trilogy could've easily made it to my top five list if only it was as memorable as the other two books. The book just didn't have the same punch I felt after reading the first two. Nevertheless, I believe Austin's best work is in [his blog](https://austinkleon.com/) anyway, and I'm an avid reader of everything he puts out in his blog.\n- **The Hobbit** by J.R.R. Tolkien. The first novel I've read after many years. Tolkien is not very versed in literary techniques but his world-building is genius! I started reading his biography earlier this year (but stopped) and watched the movie version of the book.\n- **The Art of Learning** by Josh Waitzkin. While not as comprehensive and practical as Ultralearning, Josh Waitzkin's life and processes were influential in how I currently view learning, specifically how it transfers across different areas of life.\n- **The Little Prince** by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. Reading a classic and reading it fast was a great confidence booster in my reading habit early this year. I enjoyed the humor, the drawings, and the subtle lessons sprinkled around every sentence of this book.\n- **Night** by Elie Wiesel. A very gloomy book. I won't be reading Holocaust books for a while.\n\nThat's it! That's my reading year this year. I have great books lined up for 2020 and I have begun reading some of them. I'm looking forward to another book-filled year.\n",

    "content": "\n![My hero books of 2020](my-hero-books-of-2020.jpg)\n\n\u003e When I have a little money, I buy books; and if I have any left, I buy food and clothes.\n\u003e\n\u003e Erasmus\n\nWhen I was in grade school (like many of us at that time) I was broke. I had very little money. Whatever little money I had came from pocket change left from the 20–50 pesos that my father gave me every day. That didn't change much in high school.\n\nOnce in a while, when my _titas_ come home from abroad, I'll grow about 10 times richer. They would hand out 10–20 _dollars_ to us, their nephews and nieces, which we excitedly hand over to our parents who went to town to have them changed into pesos. I was so happy to have 500–1,000 pesos, which I was free to spend however I wanted.\n\nI almost never spent this money on food or clothes. After receiving the bills, I immediately knew where to go: the bookstore. I would buy random books. Because I didn't know much about what to read (I was unaware of reviews back then, and internet access was not as available as it is now), I just chose a book based on its blurb and cover. That was how I learned how to be a reader and a writer.\n\nReading is my primary way of learning, and books are my go-to resources especially on the most important topics I am learning like philosophy, psychology, art, etc. Today, I continue to buy books and I have more money to do so. But I do more than simply buying and reading them.\n\nBack in 2018, I started tracking my reading. I kept a list of the best books I've read so far on specific topics. I also started my annual ritual of sharing [[My hero books of 2018|my \"hero books\" of the year]]. And last 2020, I started [keeping track of every single book I read](/reading/).\n\nThe next step in my reading journey is probably to be more mindful about my reading. While reading is a wonderful activity, it has its drawbacks. As Arthur Schopenhauer writes:\n\n\u003e When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process.\n\u003e\n\u003e Such, however, is the case with many men of learning: they have read themselves stupid.\n\nIt is better to be a better thinker than to be a better reader. This is the reason why although I horde books in the past, I collect less of them now and actually consider myself a slow and selective reader.\n\nThat said, I'll continue the tradition I started for myself. Here are my hero books of 2020.\n\n## The Diving Bell and the Butterfly | Jean-Dominique Bauby\n\nI am not sure whether it was a good idea that I knew how the book was written before I started reading it. But I did. And I felt guilty reading it at my pace. I felt like I should have read it slower.\n\nThe book was written by someone who had locked-in syndrome, a condition where the brain stem has failed, making the person paralyzed throughout his body and unable to talk even if his other mental processes are normal. The author of the book, Bauby, was \"fortunate\" enough to still be able to move one eye. He used this eye to write the book.\n\nCollaborating with his speech therapist, they constructed a way that he could communicate. Anyone who would like to communicate with Bauby held a card containing the letters of the alphabet arranged according to their frequency of use. The person would start pointing the letters. Bauby would blink when the correct letter was reached. Through this slow process, he dictated this short but stunningly beautiful book about the meaning of life.\n\nIt was, for sure, a labor of love. The book was literally written letter by letter. I guess, knowing that made me truly appreciate the book. The book was on my shelf for a long time, but I decided to read it only when I found myself needing some consolation and inspiration after my tinnitus started early January last year.\n\nCoping with my tinnitus was not easy, but it was nothing compared to what Bauby had to go through until he died. And he was able to give birth to something so beautiful despite his condition. The book helped me go through one of the biggest challenges I faced in my life.\n\n## Reality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World **|** Jane McGonigal\n\nI have always been a gamer. When I was a kid I never had my own Gameboy. But I would borrow one from my classmates for weeks. I would then save some money from my allowance to buy batteries so I can play Pokemon the entire weekend. In high school, I would play computer games with friends for a good amount of my lunch break, going to Math class late. I would stop playing games in college, save some NBA Live games.\n\nHowever, when I went through [[Seven Lessons I Learned Since My Depression In 2011|depression in 2011]], games helped me cope with my condition. They helped me pass time as I waited for the medicines to take effect. In 2018, when my relationship of six years ended, one of my best friends hooked me into [Underlords](https://www.underlords.com/), a strategy game, which helped me move on. The same game accompanied me during a similarly difficult time last year when I haven't habituated to my tinnitus yet. I continue to play the game today. It has become part of my daily routine.\n\nAside from the emotional benefits I experience from playing games, I have used games to enhance my mind and body coordination as well as my analytical skills. Granted, games have affected my sleep and I could get addicted to them if I let myself. But I haven't. I limit myself to at most two hours of playing per day.\n\nDespite its huge role in my emotional and even creative life, I've never been proud of being a gamer. I have avoided mentioning it in this blog or in front of people. This book was the first book to ever convince me of coming out and being proud of my gaming history.\n\nThe main moral of the book is that the elements that make games pleasurable should actually be used to redesign our social systems and institutions (education, work, etc.) so that people enjoy engaging with their world more.\n\n## The Stoic Challenge: A Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient | William B. Irvine\n\nI debated whether to include this book or not. The book was actually short and by no means dense. I feel like it could have been written as a blog post. Overall, I am not sure if this was a well-written book. However, I am including it in my hero books for the year because of the undeniable effect it has had on my life in the past months.\n\nThis is the second book I've read about stoicism. The first was [[Meditation — Aurelius (Book Summary)|Marcus Aurelius' _Meditations_]]. That book was full of wisdom but it was so hard to digest and, therefore, remember. On the other hand, I remember _The Stoic Challenge_ so easily, because its main point can be summarized into a single sentence: _Treat every setback as a challenge_. This was the first book I read that treated and emphasized this as a viable strategy for life. That simple lesson has never left me. My tinnitus is a challenge. The deaths of my pets were a challenge. The pandemic is a challenge. They are all opportunities to practice my ability to maintain emotional equilibrium during tough situations.\n\n## Switching Languages: Translingual Writers Reflect on Their Craft | Steven G. Kellman\n\nAfter Thoreau's journal, this is easily the most important book I read this year. Finding the book was serendipitous. There was no way I could have read it if I didn't find it in Booksale since it doesn't have an ebook version.\n\nIt is an essential book because it helped me address one of the most perplexing problems I've ever had as a writer: _In what language should I write?_\n\nI am tempted to say that the book's answer to this question is: _All of them_. But that will fail to capture all the nuances that come with being a multilingual English writer, something that the book was able to present so excellently.\n\nThe book is an anthology of essays written by multilingual writers from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Asia, most of whom also wrote in English. The collection is an excellent representation of the condition of multilingual English writers worldwide.\n\nAfter reading the book, I felt less weird for experiencing this tension I have among the three languages I write in. I felt less alone. Throughout the world, even the most successful writers have grappled with the identity crisis that comes with speaking multiple languages. I still continue to struggle with my voice, but this book made me realize that I need to embrace this struggle rather than avoid it.\n\nMy voice is the collection of all the identities that I carry and the languages that come with them. I learned not to hate English for colonizing my mind or my mother tongue for not being rich or interesting enough. The languages I speak are my children. I need to take care of them. I need to let them talk to each other. This book helped me nurture the desire to demonstrate my multilingualism in the work that I do.\n\n## The Journal of Henry David Thoreau, 1837–1861 | Henry David Thoreau (edited by Damion Searls)\n\nLast December 13, 2020, I finished reading Thoreau's journal after an entire year of reading each of his entries for the day. I talked about the lessons I learned from this [[What I Learned From A Year of Reading Thoreau's Journal|in another post]].\n\nThoreau's journal was the first journal by anyone, dead or alive, I have ever read in its entirety. It was instructive to see how a writer, a public figure, could differ from who he is in his most private moments. I felt I knew Thoreau well as a person after reading his biography. Reading his journal, I felt he was a friend.\n\nThe journal contains Thoreau's evolution as a writer, his most private project to create what he called a \"Kalendar\" of natural phenomena, which he never published. It contains a mixture of science and poetry that helps one appreciate how much beauty there is in the world where Thoreau lived. The journal also contains his routines and his ideas about writing and the creative life. I am an entirely different artist—no, person—after reading this book.\n\n## Other Great Reads\n\nI read a lot of poetry last year that I can almost say that 2020 was a year of poetry for me. I immersed myself in that artform last year since I joined [Tungko ng Tula](https://tungkongtula.com/), a course and community run by my friend [Rem Tanauan](https://www.instagram.com/ditomuna/). I'll probably write about my year of poetry at a different time, but here are the poetry books I read this year as well as other great reads. For a complete list of the books I read in 2020, [go here](/reading/).\n\n- **Sailing Alone Around the Room: New and Collected Poems** by Billy Collins. This is the first Billy Collins collection I read. If you want to laugh and think about the meaning of life at the same time, read him.\n- **Rewiring Tinnitus: How I Finally Found Relief From the Ringing in My Ears** by Glenn Schweitzer. This is the only book in Tinnitus I finished this year. I could have finished reading the two other books I read on the subject, but when I started feeling better, I just have to park the books and move on. That said, this book encouraged me to actually use meditation to habituate with the tinnitus. As always, meditation worked for me.\n- **Ochre Tones: Poems in English and Cebuano** by Marjorie Evasco. Her name will forever be eclipsed by her son's name (Joey Ayala), but Marjorie Evasco deserves a place of her own on the altar of verses. This is the only Filipiniana book I read this year (something I need to work more on).\n- **Misdiagnosed: One Woman's Tour of—and Escape from—Healthcareland** by Jody Berger. I read this book after going through another terrible experience with doctors. My distrust of the traditional medical system is growing by the day and Jody's example was a great beginner's guide to what lies beyond it.\n- **Selected Poems** by Carl Sandburg. The thickest poetry book I read this year. Reading him was both fun and tiring. Sandburg was not afraid to experiment with form and to explore topics that are extremely turbulent and political.\n- **Newspaper Blackout** by Austin Kleon. This is the book that encouraged me to try newspaper blackout poetry. I have done blackouts on the [Watchtower magazine](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAy9ugbhkBU/) as well as the [local Filipino tabloids](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIzYe5mByNN/).\n- **Winter Hours** by Mary Oliver. Mary Oliver's most intimate work by far. Reading her and Thoreau at the same time was a marvelous experience.\n- **Dept. of Speculation** by Jenny Offill. I wanted to put this book on my list of top hero books for this year, but for some reason, I just can't. Maybe because I need it to be life-changing or thought-provoking at least, but it failed in both. Nevertheless, the book was very, very surprising. It is the first book of its kind I've ever read: a very short novella made of very short chapters, which, in turn, are made of very short sentences and segmented thoughts. I want to write a similar book in the future!\n- **The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring** by J.R.R. Tolkien. After writing my short story Lurem, I was inspired to revisit my fantasy project. Part of going back to fantasy was, of course, reading fantasy. I intend to finish Tolkien's major works. I'm done with _The Hobbit_ and this first book of the trilogy. I'll read the second and third books, as well as the _Silmarillion_, hopefully in the near future.\n\nAnd that's it. Another reading year has ended. I'm looking forward to writing my third iteration of this post next year. I hope this post pointed you to some books you might check for your own reading list this 2021.\n\nMay your 2021 be full of joy and, well...books!",

  "/My-Journaling-System-June-2018-Edition": {
    "title": "My Journaling System (June 2018 Edition)",
    "content": "\n![Blank journal and pen on wood](blank_journal_and_pen_on_wood.jpg)\n\nMine is a simple journaling system. Although, of course, I think it can be further simplified. This is already a simplified version of what would otherwise be a very complicated system. My tendency is to create a specific journal for each life area, each interest, each intellectual pursuit. With this current system, I've done my best to bridle this tendency.\n\nThis system will change in the future as with any system in my life. But this current June 2018 version is practically what I've been using for at least a year already.\n\nThis post outlines what happens the moment an idea pops out of my head until it becomes something shareable. I publish my thoughts primarily here on the blog and on [[newsletter|my email newsletter]]. I intend to create a visual representation of the process in the future. But for now, this would be it.\n\n## Stage 1: Spark.\n\nAn idea pops out of my head. This happens in different situations. Sometimes I get ideas while I am in front of my laptop. Sometimes when I'm somewhere else in the house—doing the dishes or practicing on my yoga mat. Most of the time, I get them while I'm outdoors in nature. Because of this tendency, I need different tools to catch my ideas in different situations.\n\nAfter being with my thoughts for a very long time, I've noticed that they have different natures. Each of them tends to come at particular times of the day and in certain locations. Because of this, they want to be held in a specific kind of journal.\n\nMy system captures six kinds of entries. These are:\n\n- Tasks/Intentions\n- Creative Ideas\n- Livelihood/Business Ideas\n- Inspirational Musings\n- Intellectual Musings\n- Five-Minute Journal entries\n\n## Stage 2: Catch.\n\nBecause of their unique characteristics, I have to use different journals for different ideas. However, there is one thing common about all my catching tools: they have to have both a digital and a physical form. The physical journal serves me well when ideas come within the confines of my home. Also, there is something cathartic about the old act of writing through pen and paper.\n\nHowever, I also notice that most of my ideas come when I'm out of the house. This is the reason why I need a digital journal. In the past, I have a few installed on my smartphone but I have gone down to a single app: Evernote. Whatever app I use, it is important that it has a web or laptop counterpart so that I can transfer what I capture in my phone to my computer and vice versa.\n\nBelow are the specific journals I use for different kinds of ideas.\n\n### Tasks/Intentions\n\n- Physical journal: A medium-sized blank journal\n- Digital journal: [Evernote](https://evernote.com)\n\nMy physical journal houses my tentative tasks and intentions for the day. I usually write them after my yoga or meditation practice in the morning. Writing my priorities by hand in the morning helps me reflect on whether or not they really are worth my time. In the past, I have a separate physical journal for tasks. However, upon simplifying, I write the most important tasks I have to accomplish at any given day in the same journal where I write my five-minute journal entries.\n\nI use Evernote to house my daily intentions which I schedule throughout the day after I've written and identified them in my physical journal. However, my Evernote app contains a lot more than my tasks. Since I started using it in 2015, I've accumulated a lot of notes and created my own note-taking con productivity system. It is a combination of the principles in David Allen's [_Getting Things Done_](http://amzn.to/2iRZwgR) (GTD), Leo Babauta's [_Zen to Done_](http://amzn.to/2iNQKOo) (ZTD), Jacob Lund Fisker's [_Early Retirement Extreme_](http://amzn.to/2i2wFVZ), and Danielle Laporte's [_The Desire Map_](http://amzn.to/2jlw8jS).\n\nI'll probably have to outline my Evernote system on another post.\n\n### Creative Ideas + Livelihood/Business Ideas\n\n- Physical journal: A medium-sized blank notebook (also, sometimes, a larger sketchbook for more complex ideas)\n- Digital journal: Evernote; But I have used both Notes (iOS) and [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com) (Android) in the past\n\nMy creative and business ideas jive together on a single journal because they have one unique characteristic: they only get developed when there are no lines written on the page. This is why a plain, blank notebook or better yet a sketchbook does a really good job for these kinds of ideas.\n\nAlthough it won't do the same magic that physical blank paper does, Evernote is also helpful in capturing ideas while I'm outdoors. I used to have separate capturing apps for my different ideas but today all my digital notes are captured in a single Evernote notebook. I, later on, review these notes and transfer them to designated digital notebooks for archiving or to my to-do list if they're actionable items.\n\nIf you want a separate place to capture incoming creative thoughts, the simplicity of the iPhone's native Notes app, with its dateless entries and very limited functionalities, could serve you well. If you are on Android, Simplenote is the best option available for this purpose. I only wish it didn't have a title function because it could disrupt one's thought process.\n\n### Inspirational + Intellectual Musings + Five Minute Journal Entries\n\n- Physical journal: A medium-sized blank/lined journal\n- Digital journal: [Five Minute Journal](https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal); Evernote; but I also used [Journey](https://journey.cloud) (Android) in the past\n\nThe difference between my inspirational and intellectual musings is their tone of voice. My inspirational voice developed after a few years of writing online. This voice represents my artistic side. However, I have another voice that I couldn't quite give up because it has been with me for a long time and completes my whole personality. My inner intellectual voice is interested in logic, science, and research and this is why I have to make a distinction between the two, although of course, they can always be great partners for a beautiful book (see for example Charles Eisenstein's _[Sacred Economics](http://amzn.to/2j0yeCa)_ to see a beautiful combination of the inspirational and the intellectual).\n\nMy inspirational and intellectual musings have one thing in common: they develop in narrative form. This also sets them apart from my other ideas. Some develop into full articles that are publishable with very minor edits while others are simply too messy to publish. Whatever form they take, the beauty of these musings is they get me in a state of \"flow\" almost as if an invisible hand is guiding me towards the end of the thought process. This is why I enjoy writing them in my physical notebook.\n\nWhile on the go, I use Evernote which easily syncs with my laptop where I format articles for publishing. Before simplifying my digital system, I used the Journey app. It was a delight because it has an accurate time, date, and location stamp system which I find cool. Knowing when and where I wrote a particular entry reminds me of the exact experience when I was writing it.\n\nLast year, I found out about the Five-Minute Journal, a journal designed to help people apply research-based positive psychology advice through a daily, easy-to-do journaling practice. It was effective for me. It was the only system that made me keep a journaling practice consistently both in the morning and in the evening. I used their mobile apps but recently I began writing my entries on the same journal where I keep my inspirational and intellectual musings.\n\n## Stage 3: Filter.\n\nMy filtering process is simple. Sometimes, it could take a while to go through my past journal entries and handpick what can be edited or developed for publishing. Of course, tasks won't be published at all. Sometimes, I get concepts from my Creative + Livelihood/Business journal but most of the time they are are just too raw to develop. Usually, I get article ideas from my inspirational and intellectual musings.\n\n## Stage 4: Keep Private.\n\nAll tasks, most creative and business ideas, and a handful of inspirational and intellectual musings will never see the light of day. My five-minute journal entries do not need to be published. Once I have expressed them to myself, they have done their purpose.\n\n## Stage 5: Publish.\n\nI publish most of my works here on the blog. I also share them with my email newsletter subscribers. If you have not subscribed yet, I encourage you to do so. You can subscribe [here](newsletter.md).\n\nIn the future, I might have to get my thoughts furnished and reach out to bigger channels where more people can appreciate them. But as of now, I've realized that the process of catching my ideas, revisiting them, seeing patterns and hidden realizations, and sharing them to a few people who would feel educated, inspired, and moved to action by reading them, is more rewarding than getting a lot of publicity. Even if I do build I bigger audience, I think this internal process will still be the best part of being a writer.\n\nSo there it is, my very own journaling system. Feel free to copy it, or even better, reach out and tell me about your own system. I might learn a thing or two from you as I have from other people for the past years.\n",

    "title": "My Morning Routine (May 2018 Edition)",
    "content": "![Morning at the back of our house](morning_back_house.jpg)\n\n\u003e “The morning, which is the most memorable season of the day, is the awakening hour. Then there is least somnolence in us; and for an hour, at least, some part of us awakes which slumbers all the rest of the day and night... All memorable events, I should say, transpire in morning time and in a morning atmosphere. The Vedas say, “All intelligences awake with the morning.”\n\u003e\n\u003e \\- Henry David Thoreau, _Walden_\n\nMy mornings are a no brainer. It starts when I wake up. For some reason, I wake up at around 6 am every day, without the use of an alarm.\n\nBefore I even wake up, usually Chikako, our youngest dog, is at the foot of the stairs waiting for me to call her. I play with her on my bed for a while. This begins my day. After this, I make my bed then drink two glasses of water.\n\nThen comes the more \"sacred\" part of my morning.\n\nI retreat inside my room and do some _asanas_ or yoga postures. It's a gentle succession of postures I took from the book _The Heart of Yoga_ by T.K.V. Desikachar. The _asanas_ are meant to prepare one for breathing meditation. I've been following the same sequence every morning for the past three years and I've modified some parts of it.\n\nThe more popular sun salutations sequence is also a good simple and short sequence that one can easily integrate into any morning routine. What's great about the sun salutations is that it targets the major areas of the body making it a perfect option for busy people.\n\nAfter yoga, I sit on my mat and write on my [Five-Minute Journal](https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal). I am on the track of keeping a daily morning and evening journaling practice for about a year already, thanks for this journal. I currently use the mobile app as it's easy to use and has an option to include a photo of the day. Sometimes, when I get really inspired, I write something in my physical journal.\n\nAfter a short journaling session, I read a few pages from a good book. My standard for a \"good book\" to read in the morning is not something too heady. I love reading heady stuff—academic books, philosophy books, and science books—but not in my morning routine. As I'm writing this piece, I'm currently going through Jon Kabat-Zinn's _Wherever You Are You Are There_. I find the book perfect for my morning routine as it's easy to read, \"devotional\" and reflective in some sort, and it's divided into really short parts which I can bite through for a few minutes every morning.\n\nAfter reading, I lay down on the mat for a few minutes of breathing meditation. This usually ends my morning routine.\n\nRight now, I'm thinking about adding blogging into the mix. I want to start and maintain a blogging practice and it makes sense to stack blogging over my already established morning routine.\n\nMornings are great because we usually have more willpower and energy during this time of the day compared to afternoons or evenings. It's a great time to put ourselves in the right direction for the rest of the day. It's a great time to devote ourselves to the things that really matter to us.\n\nIn starting a morning routine, I find the website [mymorningroutine.com](https://mymorningroutine.com) and Hal Elrod's book _Miracle Morning_, great resources.\n",

    "content": "\nI should live according to however I want to. It is the only true simple answer. Even if my answer is: \"I want to live like somebody else,\" that answer is still predicated by the fact that you could choose to live according to whoever you want to follow.\n\nIn turn, this ability to choose to live however one wants stands on a few claims about reality. First, that [[Free will exists]], which, in turn, requires that a self, an active agent exists.\n\nOnly by believing in these two predicates can you truly answer the question \"How should I live?\" Once you accept that you are a self and that that self has free will (not just a robot), you have to accept that you have control over how you act. Even if you are forced to do something, you are still doing the action, not another person. You have the final say. That is why anyone forced to do something could do otherwise—with consequences, of course.\n\nOnce one believes on the predicates and on the simple answer that one should (actually, could, because there is no other way to do unless one is unconscious) live according to how one chooses, then the question of how one should live actually becomes: What kind of life or actions do you choose for yourself?\n\nA life is nothing but a collection of actions. Humans act. Even the denial of action is an action. Even inaction is action, as long as it is made by a conscious individual.\n\nActions are conscious, meaning, they are inspired by self-aware thought. Thoughts come from two places: inside and outside.\n\nSo the next question would be: Do you choose to take actions from within yourself or from outside you?\n\nPut into more intelligible words: Do you rely on yourself to define how to live? Or do you rely on others?\n\nGoing back to my previous line of thought, it might even be impossible to escape the self. The self ultimately chooses. But the inspirations for our actions could either be inspired by observing our inclinations or observing the inclinations of other people. Wouyld you rather meditate, journal, and observe over self or would you rather read an influencer, listen to your pastor, or browse your Facebook feed for inspiration on how to live?\n\n# References\n\n\n",

    "title": "My Hero Books of 2018",
    "content": "\n![My Hero Books 2018](hero_books_2018.jpg)\n\nWhile editing a photography book, I came in contact with this interesting term that food photographers use to refer to the food that they ultimately choose to feature in their photographs. They call this food the \"hero food.\" I love the term, and I think it's apt given the things photographers do just to find the best-looking food for their work.\n\nFor this post, which I hope to be writing every year, I'm borrowing the idea of the \"hero food\" to create a new term, the \"hero book.\" As a reader, I also feel like I always put an unusual amount of effort in finding the best books on subjects that I'm interested in. Luckily, sometimes, the books find me.\n\nThis year was another great reading year for me. I found a few great hero books that changed the way I see the world. While I may read less books that most readers, I see to it that I make the most use of my books. I have a reading system, which I will share in a future post. This system always involves me creating a book summary of the book I read.\n\nIn this post, I'm sharing with you four of my hero books for 2018. I'm also including a few runner ups, which you might want to check out.\n\n## Square One: The Foundations of Knowledge | Steve Patterson\n\nEarly this year (or perhaps it was December last year, I'm not quite sure), I made a serendipitous find that changed the way I see the world forever.\n\nI was doing a personal research about independent scholarship, and because I have always been a heavy podcast listener, I was listening to this podcast episode by [Tom Woods](https://tomwoods.com/ep-830-should-we-revere-academia-and-disparage-independent-scholars/). In that episode, he was talking to this person who was claiming to be \"a philosopher who works outside of academia.\" He talked about the challenges he face as an independent scholar, including some [beef](http://steve-patterson.com/responding-jason-brennans-review-square-one/) he had with an academic who ridiculed his work on social media.\n\nBecause it's pretty rare to find an independent scholar courageously doing his work outside the comforts of the university, and getting bullied at the same time, I dug into this man's work. I started listening to Steve Patterson's [podcasts](http://steve-patterson.com/podcast/). I read many of his [articles](http://steve-patterson.com/podcast/). And, of course, I read his best book so far, _Square One: The Foundations of Knowledge_.\n\nThis book was written not for academics but for every honest human being interested about how to think better about the world. It destroys the wall \"professional\" philosophers have built around their field. The book was shorter than most philosophy books, it got straight to the point, and reading it prepared me to think better.\n\nThe book inspired me to dive into philosophy and, more importantly, to reflect on my own beliefs about the world. You won't see the world the same way after reading this book. I highly recommend it.\n\nRead my summary of [_Square One: The Foundations of Knowledge_](https://vinceimbat.com/square-one/).\n\n## What Does It All Mean? A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy | Thomas Nagel\n\nSquare One lead me to seriously consider studying philosophy. But philosophy books are too many and too diverse that someone starting out can easily be overwhelmed. I Googled for advice on where to start, and one book was constantly mentioned: _What Does It All Mean?_ by Thomas Nagel.\n\nSteve Patterson's writing was clearer and more succinct, but Thomas Nagel's writing was pretty simple too. He writes better than most academics who tend to ramble around jargons.\n\nThe book introduces the reader to nine major problems in philosophy. What I like best about this book is written in the Introduction. There, Thomas Nagel talked about his philosophy (pun not intended) on how philosophy should be taught or learned.\n\nIn his own words:\n\n\u003e Before learning a lot of philosophical theories it is better to get puzzled about the philosophical questions which those theories try to answer. And the best way to do that is to look at some possible solutions and see what is wrong with them.\n\nI like this approach. It encourages me to rely on my own thinking first before relying on others. So, I haven't read a lot of philosophy books since this one. What I do is to journal my own answers to the questions based on my own analysis and reflection. This is very much unlike how most would do it in the university. My professors at the university would pour every reading they fancy into us, thinking that the more we read about something, the more we understand it. But philosophy is not really about how much books you've read. It's about how much you've practiced philosophizing using your own mental abilities.\n\nRead my summary of [_What Does It All Mean? A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy_](https://vinceimbat.com/what-does-it-all-mean/).\n\n## Beyond Morality | Richard Garner\n\nThis is easily the most difficult book I read this year. But I read it anyway because I know of no other book that talks about the same subject.\n\nThe reason why I dove into philosophy this year was because I feel like I have been perplexed by the same old question my whole life: How should I live? After doing some reading in philosophy, I immediately realized that the question that was bothering me was the main question asked in one of philosophy's major branches: ethics.\n\nIn ethics, the reasons behind our actions are explored, and the prevailing way of thinking in this field is that our actions are either \"bad\" or \"good.\" We act out actions because they are \"good.\" We avoid certain ones because they are \"bad.\"\n\nSurprisingly, there is a way of thinking that completely rejects this dominant perspective. Moral or ethical nihilists believe that there are no absolute and objective moral standards. Things are not \"good\" or \"bad.\" They're just what they are.\n\nIt's a difficult position to wrap one's head around. But after I examined their arguments, they made perfect sense. Beyond Morality extends the arguments of moral nihilism to and admonition to abandon all forms of moral language. According to Garner, this position, which he calls \"moral abolitionism,\" is not only logically sound; it might just be the missing solution to a world that has gone \"immoral.\"\n\nHe closed the book through these words:\n\n\u003e If we can give up moralist language as well as moralist beliefs, if we can learn to operate beyond morality and beyond duplicity about morality, we will find ourselves in a position to be more honest and straightforward with ourselves and others. This is bound to result in a better understanding of what is happening—all around. Then, if our wider and deeper knowledge unlocks our compassion, as I predict it will, we will have transcended any need for the illusions of morality, and we and others can be comfortable with our spontaneity _and_ with the conventions that give a familiar and comfortable structure to our lives.\n\n## Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones | James Clear\n\nAnother great quote from Richard Garner's _Beyond Morality_ is the following:\n\n\u003e We are not going to get peace and happiness by arguing that war is morally wrong and happiness a human right. Peace and happiness will come only when we develop habits and institutions that generate and nourish them - habits of cooperation and consideration, habits of generosity and of yielding for the sake of harmony.\n\nI am citing this here because it relates with perhaps the most useful book I read this year, _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear. This is his first book. He released it in October and instantly became a New York Times bestseller.\n\nWhile the first three books in this list shaped the way I see the world, it is James Clear's book which just might put all those philosophizing into practical application. Like Richard Garner said in the quote above, it is through habits that we achieve the things that we long for. These include both personal goals and societal goals.\n\nI am quite proud to say that I believed on James Clear's work even before he became a bestselling author. He's a big influence in the work that I do. Read this book to know what I mean.\n\nRead my summary of [_Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones_](https://vinceimbat.com/atomic-habits/).\n\n## Runner-ups\n\n- Jon Kabat-Zinn, _Wherever You Go, There You Are_\n- Amy Webb, _Data, A Love Story_\n- John W. James and Frank Cherry, _The Grief Recovery Handbook: A Step-by-Step Program for Moving Beyond Loss_\n- Henry David Thoreau, _Walking_\n\nAnd that's it! My hero books for 2018. Here's for a new year of great books!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI stole the idea for this post from the great [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/tag/my-reading-year/).\n",

    "content": "\nI am writing this to guide me in finding the right people to connect to and build relationships with professionally and personally. I want to embody [[Radha Agrawal]]'s principle that we have to work towards removing compartmentalizations among the people I build relationships with (i.e., the people I like to work with should also be the people I could eventually call my friends).\n\nAlthough I will go to as much detail as I can in describing this ideal persona, I would summarize it by saying this: my ideal persona is also myself—an extension of my values. They may not be exactly like me, but they represent the people I want to see more in the world. Multiply my ideal persona and you get individuals building the utopia that I want to live in. Because of this, their psychographics is more imprtant than their demographics.\n\nMy intention is to locate, connect, and serve the interests of my ideal persona at any given moment in my journey. I will serve them using my current skills. I will do my best to align [[My livelihood system]] with their needs. I shall do this as I work towards fulfilling [[My life plan]] and [[thoughts/my quest]]. My ultimate goal is to live a life where in I am doing what I love serving the people that I love.\n\n# Psychographics\n\nMy ideal audience persona is more like me. He has the following characteristics:\n\n- **Self-directed learner.** He is a self-directed learner. He chooses to create learning plans autonomously instead of relying on courses or educational institutions.\n- **Generalist.** He is a generalist. He is a holistic thinker, a full-spectrum thinker. He discerns that knowledge is interconnected and it is better to have a generalist perspective most of the time.\n- **Moderate.** He believes in moderation. He avoids extreme positions. He always tries to listen to all sides even if he disagrees with them.\n- **Skeptic.** He is a skeptic. He is a careful and cautious thinker. He doesn’t easily jump into conclusions without enough evidence. He wants to see things as they really are.\n- **Philosophical.** He is motivated by building his own worldview.\n- **Intellectual.** He is sophisticated in his intellectual practice. He is knowledgeable about different strategies of knowledge management. Most importantly, he has a regular intellectual practice.\n- **Meaningful.** While he is very intellectual, he understands the importance of having a rich emotional inner life. He seeks happiness and meaningful experiences.\n- **Contemplative.** He practices contemplation and meditation with the goal of developing understanding and compassion.\n- **Community-oriented.** He is introverted, but he seeks the company of others. He is someone who I want to be friends with and be in a room with. He knows that community is necessary and important in a philosphical and contemplative quest.\n- **Health-enthusiast.** He is deeply conscious about the importance of health. He takes care and listens to it.\n- **Anarchic.** He values freedom deeply. He is an anarchist or at least a libertarian. He believes that the best government is something that has very little to no governance.\n- **Self-actualizer and Transcender.** He values growth. He wants to provide for his basic needs so he can self-actualize and eventually transcend himself.\n- **Tolerant.** He is not fast at judging others. He does not use the concept of morality to get what he needs. He is a moral nihilist.\n- **Rational.** He values rationality.\n- **Appreciative.** He feels awe when he sees beauty particularly in nature.\n- **Intentional.** He values intentionality. He uses a life management system to be very intentional in life.\n- **Independent Intellectual.** He is uncomfortable with spiritual and religious language but is deeply called to think about fundamental issues of life. However, he is also put off by excessive academic jargon.\n\nThis list of values and beliefs are not exhaustive. But they are basically my values and beliefs. I will add more to this list eventually.\n\nThis list is not an exclusion criteria. It is an ideal that represents possible connections I can build.\n\nMy mentors and peers, ideally must share these values and beliefs, but they are different from fans by virtue of them having a practice like mine (see [[thoughts/my ideal mentors and peers]]).",

    "title": "My life work is both emotional and intellectual",
    "content": "\nIntuitively, it felt like happiness was the end goal of my life work. It is clear now that there are two equally important goals of my life work:\n\n1. To enrich meaning in my life.\n2. To develop emotional stability and flourishing.\n\nTo develop emotional stability, I need to work on my inner emotional life. To enrich meaning, I need to develop my intellectual prowess.\n\n# Emotional\n\nOne important purpose of my life work is to cultivate a particular state of mind. One of my tasks is to design a life that maximized mental stability and positive emotions. In this project, I must architecture behavior, information, environment, and thoughts to feel better, live better, and construct a better world. For someone, who was suicidal at least twice in his life, it should be expected that feeling good is a priority for me—to never want to leave the world again, to never have to feel lonely and sad and be out of control again.\n\n# Intellectual\n\nThe other half of my work is intellectual. Yes, I want a life that is mentally stable and can be filled with happiness and rich inner experiences. However, a prerequisite to that is that I train myself in intellectual work.\n\nThis could sound counterintuitive. After all, sages have always warned about the dangers of intellectualization—that it lessens compassion and causes suffering, which is anti-happiness ([[The Buddha avoided metaphysics]]). I can see their point. I don't necessarily enjoy intellectual work sometimes, and people who are too caught up in intellectual work can become too self-righteous and hard on their beliefs and ideologies. But to completely reject intellectual work, I think is an extreme position, especially because of how fundamental truth and reason are in the pursuit of the good life.\n\nWhy?\n\n“Feeling better” is a [[Mental state]]. Sometimes we arrive at this mental state through a single action or a short series of actions ([[Experiencing a desired emotion is the point of taking action]]). However, to continuously feel better, to sustain positive experiences, and give ourselves more chances of feeling better, we need to curate our environment ([[Enhance the experience of a mental state by modifying the environment]]). Curating one's environment involves complicated projects that require massive amounts of information. This is the fact of life. To engage with this information, one needs to perform intellectual work.  It is inevitable to use one's intellectual skills to design an environment that not only makes positive emotions possible but sustains them as well.\n\nOne way to curate one’s environment is to construct one’s worldview or way of life. This is especially necessary for someone who realizes that we are not bestowed a ready-made purpose in life ([[thoughts/there is no destiny]]; [[There is no single purpose everyone must follow]]).\n\nIf this is one’s position, then one has no choice but to DIY the creation of one’s purpose and the creation of one’s worldview. This can only be possible through the power of one’s mind—through reason. We can only act on something we understand.\n\nThere is another fundamental reason why I embrace the intellectual in my life. Well-being (or Ginhawa), the ultimate principle (if I am going to use one to direct my life) ([[Do I need an ultimate principle to serve as a life purpose?]])\n\nIf feeling good is my ultimate goal, then that makes me a hedonist. But as the [[Experience machine]] shows, there are other motivations to aspire to other than happiness. Meaning and truth are things that don't necessarily contribute to our general happiness, they are ends of their own, but both seem to have a big role to play in the good life. And their pursuit requires reason and intellectual work.\n\nIn conclusion, I seem to need both the ability to feel good and to create meaning, which involves activities that don’t necessarily make me feel good always.\n\n# References\n",

    "content": "\nI  believe that [[thoughts/there is no destiny]]. [[Purpose does not arise from the objective physical world]] and [[There is no single purpose everyone must follow]]. We were thrown in this world and [[thoughts/life is inherently meaningless]]. But this is actually a good thing because it means [[We create our individual purpose]]. [[thoughts/meaningful living is possible despite meaninglessness]].\n\nWe make meaning by pursuing experiences and interpreting them. We need to do this, to fill this life with experiences, memories, and knowledge. These make life valuable and meaningful. And nothing makes life more meaningful than navigating this solitude with building relationships with others. These relationships are built through compassion, a skill that can be learned and nurtured.\n\nI believe that [[Freedom is an essential prerequisite for optimal Ginhawa]]. Therefore, individuals should help each other maximize each other's individual freedom. That involves making sure the liberties of others are respected. Although individual freedom is paramount, relationships, harmony, cooperation, peace, and community are also essential in living a good life because they are the bedrock for freedom.\n\nMoney is only necessary for sustenance and security. It is also a tool to accomplish things or help others but it isn't the most important thing. One can accomplish a lot even with very little money. Fame shouldn't be pursued. [[Fame is terrible to happiness]]. If any, [[Fame is a by-product of authenticity and luck]], a side-effect of living a life of integrity and passion.\n\nSince [[There is no objective meaning]], there are no naturally occurring values. I subscribe to [[Amoralism]], which argues that our ideas of good and evil are simply subjective expressions of personal preferences. This means that there are no natural rights and that [[morality is a fiction]] and it is best to avoid these in dealing with our fellow humans. Being honest about these things usually lead us to good places.\n\nThere is something beyond us, more powerful and primordial—the universe, order, structure. This is not necessarily God and it doesn't have to be worshipped. But we should allow ourselves to feel in awe of its mystery. Recognizing the existence of this \"unmoved mover\" involves accepting the fact that I didn't come into this life by my own accord. I was brought here by someone or something that is way more powerful than myself. And the nature of this thing or person is filled with mystery. The answers about its nature are not intuitive. They have to be pondered about. But answers don't have to be clear or final. The awe that the mystery produces is enough to move me to embrace [[thoughts/intentional living]] (i.e., appreciate everything and every moment that I am alive and let that appreciation guide me to do the most important and appropriate action moment by moment).",

    "content": "\nMY PROBLEM WITH THE IDEA OF \"FLOW\" IN CREATIVITY\n\nI have a big, big problem with this idea of flow in creativity. This idea that something out of me, not me, is pouring the ideas into my head and that I take no ownership on any of them. When I believe this, I feel like a passive, impotent creator. No, I am not even a creator in this framework. I am simply a slave, an unconscious temporary container for this God or Divine power or Muse who does the thinking or creating for me.\n\nI beg to disagree.\n\nI recognize that insights and ideas come to me in unnexpected moments. I do not have absolute control over my thoughts, and this phenomenon feels \"mystical\" more often than not. But I am not ONLY a channel. I am not ONLY a medium. I refuse to denegrate my role in all of these. I am an ACTIVE CO-CREATOR of the children of my mind. They are MY children even if I am not their only parent. The reason being that I am fully conscious when the pouring is happening. I am there catching every single word, image, and sensation. And that I am there, say, instead of you, makes me a unique active participant in this process. And when I edit the words and think about them and organize them into a more beautiful form, am I not showing the world I am an active cocreator?\n\nOf course, being a cocreator of my creations means that I am partly to be held responsible for where these creations end up. In other words, it is impossible to be totally unattached to them and how the world accepts them. But I would rather suffer the pain of that responsibility than accept that I have no active part in bringing them into the world.\n\n# References\n",

  "/My-strategy-for-sharing": {
    "title": "My strategy for sharing",
    "content": "\nThere is a tight connection between [[Review]] and [[Sharing]]. Not all artifacts created during a creative session get shared, and perhaps they shouldn’t. Of course, strategies differ from person to person, but there is a big chance that you don't want to overwhelm your audience or yourself by oversharing. Reviews are necessary to determine which among the artifacts created are worth sharing.\n\nIn my strategy, a period of reviewing will usually be followed by a period of sharing.\n\n# Daily\n\nEvery morning, I perform [[My daily review routine]]. If I find something from my recent process that I think is worth-sharing then I post on social media. If it's an update, I share a short post and a related photo. If it’s a question, I just ask the question. I share via Instagram and Facebook. But I want to explore sharing via Mastodon.\n\nHaving said that, I don’t want to pressure myself with sharing daily. If there is nothing good to share, I don’t have to share.\n\n# Weekly\n\nEvery Monday, I perform [[My weekly review routine]]. I simply review my daily reports and aggregate them to create a weekly report. I won't share this report though as I don't want to be pressured to produce a publishable artifact every week. In addition, I also don't want to be pressured to make progress every week. Progress will be done, but I don't want to be pressured to make it.\n\n# Monthly\n\nEvery beginning of the month, I perform [[my monthly review routine]]. Using a template, I review weekly reports and aggregate them into a monthly report. This monthly report gets shared to an email list via TinyLetter. Like the annual report, this is a non-negotiable artifact that has to be shared every month.\n\n# Annually\n\nEvery first week of January, I perform [[My annual review routine]]. Using a template, I review monthly reports and aggregate them into an annual report. This annual report gets shared to my email list via TinyLetter. Along with the monthly report, this is a non-negotiable artifact that has to be shared every year.\n\n# As it happens\n\nIn line with the philosophy of to [[thoughts/work with the garage door up]], changes in my Talahardin notes or website pages go live whenever they are published. Those who use an RSS feed to follow my website will receive notifications automatically when a page is published or gets updated. However, I am not compelled to share these in other venues. They are meant to be explored by the curious.\n\nThat said, [[My note-writing process]] scheduled every morning should allow me to do incremental writing progress related to my individual projects. Each project has to be documented and reported slowly through notes that later on evolve into publishable reports that make up the pages of the website.\n\n# Inspiration\n\nThis strategy was inspired by [[Hundred Rabbits]]’ [logs](https://100r.co/site/log.html) and [[Andy Matuschak]]'s [working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).\n\n",

Highlight the actions that you are most likely to take.**\n\n- Consider beginning or continuing your studies in philosophy, literature, or psychology. You will always enjoy subjects that stimulate your thinking.\n- List your ideas in a log or diary. These ideas will serve as grist for your mental mill, and they might yield valuable insights.\n- Deliberately build relationships with people you consider to be “big thinkers.” Their example will inspire you to focus your own thinking.\n- Schedule time for thinking; it can be energizing for you. Use these occasions to muse and reflect.\n- Take time to write. Writing might be the best way for you to crystallize and integrate your thoughts.\n- Find people who like to talk about the same issues you do. Organize a discussion group that addresses your subjects of interest.\n\n**How will you commit to taking action? Write your own personalized action item that you will take in the next 30 days.**\n\n**Input**\n\n**Which of these action items speak to you? Highlight the actions that you are most likely to take.**\n\n- Look for jobs in which you are charged with acquiring new information each day, such as teaching, research, or journalism.\n- Devise a system to store and easily locate information. This can be as simple as a file for all the articles you have clipped or as sophisticated as a computer database.\n- Your mind is open and absorbent. You naturally soak up information in the same way that a sponge soaks up water. But just as the primary purpose of the sponge is not to permanently contain what it absorbs, neither should your mind simply store information. Input without output can lead to stagnation. As you gather and absorb information, be aware of the individuals and groups that can most benefit from your knowledge, and be intentional about sharing with them.\n- You might naturally be an exceptional repository of facts, data, and ideas. If that’s the case, don’t be afraid to position yourself as an expert. By simply following your Input talents, you could become known as the authority in your field.\n- Remember that you must be more than just a collector of information. At some point, you’ll need to leverage this knowledge and turn it into action. Make a point of identifying the facts and data that would be most valuable to others, and use this information to their advantage.\n- Identify your areas of specialization, and actively seek more information about them.\n- Schedule time to read books and articles that stimulate you.\n- Deliberately increase your vocabulary. Collect new words, and learn the meaning of each of them.\n- Identify situations in which you can share the information you have collected with other people. Also make sure to let your friends and colleagues know that you enjoy answering their questions.\n\n**How will you commit to taking action? Write your own personalized action item that you will take in the next 30 days.**\n\n**Connectedness**\n\n**Which of these action items speak to you? Highlight the actions that you are most likely to take.**\n\n- Consider roles in which you listen and counsel. You can become adept at helping other people see connection and purpose in everyday occurrences.\n- Explore specific ways to expand your sense of connection, such as starting a book club, attending a retreat, or joining an organization that puts Connectedness into practice.\n- You are aware of the boundaries and borders created within organizations and communities, but you treat these as seamless and fluid. Use your Connectedness talents to break down silos that prevent shared knowledge.\n- Help people see the connections among their talents, their actions, their mission, and their successes. When people believe in what they are doing and feel like they are part of something bigger, commitment to achievement is enhanced.\n- Partner with someone with strong Communication talents. This person can help you with the words you need to describe vivid examples of connection in the real world.\n- Don’t spend too much time attempting to persuade others to see the world as a linked web. Be aware that your sense of connection is intuitive. If others don’t share your intuition, rational argument will not persuade them.\n- Your philosophy of life compels you to move beyond your own self-interests and the interests of your immediate constituency and sphere of influence. As such, you see the broader implications for your community and the world. Explore ways to communicate these insights to others.\n- Seek out global or cross-cultural responsibilities that capitalize on your understanding of the commonalities inherent in humanity. Build universal capability, and change the mindset of those who think in terms of “us” and “them.”\n\n**How will you commit to taking action? Write your own personalized action item that you will take in the next 30 days.**\n\n**Strategic**\n\n**Which of these action items speak to you? Highlight the actions that you are most likely to take.**\n\n- Take the time to fully reflect or muse about a goal that you want to achieve until the related patterns and issues emerge for you. Remember that this musing time is essential to strategic thinking.\n- Find a group that you think does important work, and contribute your strategic thinking. You can be a leader with your ideas.\n- Your strategic thinking will be necessary to keep a vivid vision from deteriorating into an ordinary pipe dream. Fully consider all possible paths toward making the vision a reality. Wise forethought can remove obstacles before they appear.\n- Make yourself known as a resource for consultation with those who are stumped by a particular problem or hindered by a particular obstacle or barrier. By naturally seeing a way when others are convinced there is no way, you will lead them to success.\n- Trust your intuitive insights as often as possible. Even though you might not be able to explain them rationally, your intuitions are created by a brain that instinctively anticipates and projects. Have confidence in these perceptions.\n- Make sure that you are involved in the front end of new initiatives or enterprises. Your innovative yet procedural approach will be critical to the genesis of a new venture because it will keep its creators from developing deadly tunnel vision.\n\n**How will you commit to taking action? Write your own personalized action item that you will take in the next 30 days.**\n\n**Learner**\n\n- Refine how you learn. For example, you might learn best by teaching; if so, seek out opportunities to present to others. You might learn best through quiet reflection; if so, find this quiet time.\n- Develop ways to track the progress of your learning. If there are distinct levels or stages of learning within a discipline or skill, take a moment to celebrate your progression from one level to the next. If no such levels exist, create them for yourself (e.g., reading five books on the subject or making three presentations on the subject).\n- Be a catalyst for change. Others might be intimidated by new rules, new skills, or new circumstances. Your willingness to soak up this newness can calm their fears and spur them to action. Take this responsibility seriously.\n- Seek roles that require some form of technical competence. You will enjoy the process of acquiring and maintaining this expertise.\n- As far as possible, shift your career toward a field with constantly changing technologies or regulations. You will be energized by the challenge of keeping up.\n- Because you are not threatened by unfamiliar information, you might excel in a consulting role (either internal or external) in which you are paid to go into new situations and pick up new competencies or languages quickly.\n- Research supports the link between learning and performance. When people have the opportunity to learn and grow, they are more productive and loyal. Look for ways to measure the degree to which you and others feel that your learning needs are being met, to create individualized learning milestones, and to reward achievements in learning.\n- Honor your desire to learn. Take advantage of adult educational opportunities in your community. Discipline yourself to sign up for at least one new academic or adult learning course each year.\n- Time disappears and your attention intensifies when you are immersed in studying or learning. Allow yourself to “follow the trail” by scheduling learning sessions during periods of time that will not be interrupted by pressing engagements.\n\n**How will you commit to taking action? Write your own personalized action item that you will take in the next 30 days.**\n\n**Work based on your strengths**\n\nIntellection\n\n- Intellectually challenging\n- Philosophical debates with colleagues\n- Work where you can share ideas and pose questions\n\nInput\n\n- Learning\n- Opportunity to share what you have learned\n- Research\n\nConnectedness\n\n- Incorporate your need to serve all of humankind into whatever career you choose.\n- Opt to work in fields and for organizations whose values mirror your own.\n\nStrategic\n\n- Psychology\n- Allow you to be a leader and voice your ideas\n- Consulting\n\nLearner\n\n- Constant learning\n- Study is a way of life\n- Competency is valued\n- Develop your competency\n\n",

    "title": "My workview",
    "content": "\nWork, in its essence, is simply [[thoughts/action]]. I perform different kinds of work, but some of them are closer to the meaning of my life. This kind of work might be aptly called a [[vocation]]. My vocation doesn't have to be something that pays me. I believe that [[Some important work have to be done even if they are not profitable]].\n\nThat said, I could not neglect the fact that I live in a predominantly exchange society, which necessitates that I find myself work that produces money that I can use to pay for my needs. I call this work a \"livelihood\" or \"bread labor.\" Balancing these two kinds of work is a reality that artists like me need to embrace and navigate. There are different ways to do this:\n\n1. I could make my vocation and job totally separate.\n2. I could build a patronage that supports my art.\n3. I could turn some parts of my vocation into an income-generating source, while maintaining integrity of my vocation.\n4. I could live a life of intentional poverty.\n\nHowever I choose to balance vocation and livelihood, I should always maintain integrity. The day job, business, or patronage I find or build to support my vocation must align, integrate, and ideally support my vocation beyond just material sustenance. This will help me continue working to support my vocation, which is essential if I don't want to corrupt it by forcing it to make money for me. This means that whatever work I do at whatever level of importance to myself, it should always align to my values. At the very minimum a great livelihood must have two to three of the following criteria:\n\n1. Provides enough income that I need to get by (and, if possible, extra benefits).\n2. Has a flexible working time that I am able to chose when to work and for how much, which saves and frees up time that I can use for my vocation.\n3. It conserves (and does not steal from) the energy I ought to use for my vocation.\n4. It is enjoyable.\n5. It is aligned with my vocation.\n6. It allows me access to training and equipment I can use to advance my vocation.\n7. It provides opportunities for me to connect with people that could help advance my vocation.\n\nHowever, I am aware that fulfilling these criteria is not always possible. Sometimes, I need to compromise them to cover my other values like fulfilling my material needs or supporting a family. I could compromise sometimes but doing so while recognizing that any compromise could lead to possible drawbacks in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, a compromise (i.e., taking work that is not that aligned with my vocation and that I don't fully enjoy) can be transformed by a mindset shift. Instead of seeing bread labor as a nuisance that takes me away from my vocation, I need to treat it with the same sacredness that I treat my vocation. [[thich nhat hanh]] said, \"The feeling that any task is a nuisance will soon disappear if it is done in mindfulness.\" This mindfulness, this quality of action, is the attitude that I need to cultivate in everything I do, whether it is more aligned to my joy or not. Everything, every tiny task and action is part of my life work. I should stop looking at my livelihood as simply something that provides money, especially when it satisfies two to three important criteria indicated above.\n\nMy choice of work affects my entire personhood, both body and mind. Therefore, I want work that can also be restorative not just to me but to those who receive the fruits of my labor. I want to do work with a direct impact to its receivers, so that I could see my work immediately making a difference. In short, work has to provide an avenue to experience and create a meaningful life.\n\nTo do\n- You have described what you are looking for in your livelihood. How about your other work? Especially vocation?\n- Update criteria for day job and insert insights from [[My ideal day job]]",

    "content": "\n## Writing\n\n**How long have you been writing regularly?**\n\nI starte writing regularly since I starte my journaling practice around 2018. So that's about four years already.\n\n**How much do you write each week?**\n\nNow, I write at least two page on my journal daily. I take notes while outdoors. I also write notes on my [[Talahardin]]. I published a 500–1,000-word essay every two weeks and another 1,000-word essay every month. I write probably 7,000–10,000 words per week.\n\n**Is your schedule structured or sporadic?**\n\nStructured. The only exception to my schedule is when I work during the last five days of the month or when I travel.\n\n**Are you focusing on one project or experimenting with various ideas?**\n\nRight now, I am experimenting with multiple ideas. I am feeling myself among writing practical philosophy, nature writing, place-based writing, and walking narratives. Most recently, I am attracted to the idea of writing my own style of romantic excursions in the tradition of Thoreau. I want to incorporate philosophy into writing narratives. I have several ideas for book projects (e.g., one book for each of the places I lived in: San Jacinto, Baguio, Los Baños). But I haven't committed on one yet.\n\n## Reading\n\n**Do you read regularly? How many books per year?**\n\nYes. Last year, was my slowest year in terms of reading, because I spent more time reading articles. However, since 2015, I average 10 books a year.\n\n**What are your three favorite topics or genres?**\n\nI like reading creative nonfiction books that illuminate something about the world (philosophical)\n, tells the story of a person worth emulating (biographical), and is situated in a specific time and space (historical and geographical).\n\n**What are the last five books you read?**\n\n1. Kissa by Kissa by Craig Mod\n2. DIY MFA by Gabriela Pereira\n3. Transcend by Scott Barry Kaufmann\n4. A Philosophy of Walking by Frederic Gros\n5. Be the Gateway by Dan Blankaz\n\n## Community\n\n**Do you have writer friends or colleagues?**\n\nYes. Rem, Claire, Lea, Bevs, CR, Rom, etc. But these are more of friends than colleagues, and not everyone is a serious writer like me.\n\n**Do you have a critique group where you can exchange feedback?**\n\nNone.\n\n**Have you gone to any events or conferences?**\n\nOnly once: Saling Panitik 2019.\n\n**Do you read any writing blogs, magazines, or websites?**\n\nNot really on writing per se. I only read blogs and websites of writers I admire.\n\n**Do you connect with writers on social media? If so, where?**\n\nI don't deliberately interact with them. But I follow them on IG and Twitter. My writer friends are, of course, in Facebook.\n\n**What is the biggest \"win\" you've experienced in your writing, reading, or community building this past year?**\n\nI was able to increase the writing I do through the Talahardin, which I then used to complete two seasons of Lilim.\n\n**If you could improve one thing in your writing life, what would that be?**\n\nBuild my writing community.\n\n# References\n\nPereira, G.

I need to be super clear about what I truly stand for and what I am doing to uphold what I stand for. I need to be true to myself. I need to be aligned. Learning how to better my life, bettering it, and sharing about this process is what I want to do—no, need to do.\n\nI want to combine personal story, story-telling, and good research to try to create works that teach “values” in a subtle, facilitative way.

But there is no other explanation for this truth other than it is logically necessary for it to be true. That doesn't remove the sense of mystery though.\n- The universe, through the platonic realm, works like a human mind.\n   - That is, it is intelligent. It has fine-tuned laws. It has clockwork. All of these seem to suggest the existence of a source of such intelligence. It is mysterious how intelligence could exist outside a human mind. But it is what it is.\n\n# References",

Its language is visual.\n\nThis is the reason why it is so difficult to build a relationship with it. We build relationships with people we can talk to, with those who benefit us and us them. Ideally, we know them by their stories. Nature does not have those qualities inherently. It can feel like a one-way relatonship with it sometimes, until we go deeper and understand how much we are all connected.\n\nThis also explains why it is so easy to ignore the less bright and less loud parts of nature. Trees that are all green, grasses that are too small. Only to find out that these silent beings serve a lot in the ecosystem.\n\nThe natural world talks by simply being itself. It speaks by moving, doing what it has to do.\n\nIt seems then that the natural sciences is the language through which we can uncover these stories. A jump-off point for conversing with the natural world. Through science, we observe plants, animals, rocks, soil—all non-speaking entities—to understand where they come from, what they want, where they are going. They talk through their actions, through non-human sounds, and we interpret them by deducing the patterns they create.\n\nBut the natural world does not understand the language of man. It does not understand poetry. It only understands the language of action.\n\nYou can talk about conserving nature nonstop, but nature won’t understand you until you strike a stick to the ground to support a dying plant. Nature talks through actions, listens through actions.\n\n# References\n",

Also, perhaps a true practice of non-attachment involves being not too attached to non-attachment itself and allowing ourselves to face the full range of human emotion and experience by commiting ourselves fully to someone or something and letting ourselves \"suffer\" from their loss.\n\n",

In a lot of contexts, the nonbelievers are required to show respect to believers (e.g., to not express their doubts or contrarian opinions, to participate in rituals even if they don't believe it as a gesture of respect, etc.). But the same is not asked from believers.\n\nMost believers feel that they have this moral duty to convert non-believers into believing and shun those who constantly refuse to be converted. Meanwhile, most non-believers don't care about what you believe in as long as you don't bother them.\n\nI see this in religion, philosophy, science, politics, and even inside my own family haha.\n\n# References\n",

    "content": "\n![Flowers above a stairs](flowers_above_stairs.jpg)\n\nI came to the realization that most of the people I have now in my life are individuals who are comfortable being alone with themselves for long stretches of time.\n\nMany of them are contemplatives with daily practices that require alone time and concentration. But some of them are just artists with weird ideas that suck them into blissful isolation most days.\n\nI often wonder whether having friends who are introverted and monkish in nature is healthy for my well-being. These are people I get to see after long periods of time stretching from a week to months. I would love to be with them more often but here's the challenge: they require a lot of alone time, and I require it too.\n\nContrary to popular belief, creativity blossoms in routine and habit. I have rituals that get me into the mood to write, take photos, or just think. And these rituals are daily and weekly. I would wager that all my cool friends have rituals too. These rituals need commitment and structure: a weird \"paradox\" where order creates chaotic creativity.\n\nWhat I notice is that these friends of mine, who are comfortable being by themselves, are also the healthiest people I know emotionally and mentally. They do not need other people to complete them. They are complete by themselves and so when they offer themselves to others they do so from a place of abundance rather than need.\n\nThese are people who are self-aware, who knows what they want, what they value, and what their standards and boundaries are. These are people who can sit with uncomfortable emotions and thoughts that often visit when one is alone. These are people who don't need chemicals or vices to get through difficult times or loneliness.\n\nI would love to always be with these people. But I also see that to be with them requires that I respect and honor their time, routine, and tendencies. Because these are the things that make them awesome. And if this means I will be seeing them after a month or so, that's okay. Because the long wait is always worth it.\n",

  "/On-Using-Poetry-and-Story-telling-to-Express-Your-Beliefs": {
    "title": "On Using Poetry and Story-telling to Express Your Beliefs",
    "content": "\n![Lamp](lamp.jpg)\n\nI do believe in the pursuit of truth. And I do appreciate the power of debates in uncovering the truth. But this world is a tough world—and not everybody is prepared to enter the world of philosophical debates.\n\nMuch of what philosophy is about is \"being sure about what is really there\" (facts) and differentiating it from \"what we want to be there\" (subjective values). To be honest, being _very sure_ about what is really there is not really _that_ necessary in living \"a good life\". Some of the happiest people are not necessarily the most philosophical. You can die happy even if you lived an unexamined life. You can die happy even if your entire belief system is built on a lie. This, I think, is even the norm. Most people will be able to go on with life even without challenging their assumptions about the world.\n\nBut for a select few, understanding what is \"truly there\" has a profound influence on their sense of well-being. They need to know the facts before they define their values and, therefore, before they define their actions. This, they think, is what a life of integrity is about: knowing what you are doing and why you are doing them. And integrity, for these people, is an essential ingredient for a good life.\n\nI sympathize with them. I was once asked by a friend why I even bothered asking questions about life and existence. He asked what I was trying to achieve from it. Why not just live and let go of all the thinking? I did not expect someone to question my intentions in being philosophical. As far as I could remember, I was naturally inquisitive about the \"deep stuff\" ever since I was a child. It is what I have been doing even before I learned the word \"philosophy\". It made me happy and lessened my anxiety knowing that I understood the world I was living in. It is a personal preference that I feel uncomfortable justifying to other people.\n\nBut I also get why my friend was asking about my intentions. People who are philosophical need to be scrutinized for their intentions. Why are they spending all their energy thinking about problems that may never even be solved? And why do some of them feel like it is their greatest crusade to show people how wrong they are?\n\nI think it is natural for us to share our truth—to make other people know our truth so they can finally get to \"see us\". I feel the same way. But there is a difference between speaking your truth and evangelizing it to the point that you feel that it is your divine mission to put the other on an opposing side.\n\nSome people do this, and while I sincerely think that they are doing it with good intentions, they are probably welcoming more unnecessary stress in their lives than they can possibly handle (not to mention the stress they put on others).\n\nThe truth is, we can never truly convince anyone. People convince themselves. What we can do is either _force_ them to convince themselves or _facilitate_ that transformation through the careful and subtle expression of our innermost beliefs. This is why I am thinking about exploring how I can express my ideas about the world through poetry, personal essays, and fantasy fiction, instead of direct language in contexts like philosophical debates.",

    "title": "On articulating",
    "content": "\n[[Jan Zwicky]], the female Canadian philosopher I am only getting acquainted to by now said that some questions are unanswerable by words. They cannot be articulated. An example of such question is this: \"What is the sound of rain?\" Another question, which is closer to my heart is \"What is a brain zap?\" A \"brain zap\" is a common term people with depression use to describe a symptom (or is it a side effect of psychiatric meds?) that is difficult to articulate. I honestly think the best way for someone to understand it is to experience it themselves. I tried articulating it once bt all I could do was this: \"Our nervous system has electricity right? Imagine that for a slight second, the electricity was gone. That's a brain zap.\"\n\nAnswering these questions using words is difficult. We could try byt we can only do so by metaphors. But even those metaphors don't do the entire job. It is the reader's resonance to them that does the job but not perfectly. And so we can say that a job of a poet is to articulate those answers that cannot be articulated or eludes words. Perhaps, most obviously, in the context of a relationship, the occurrence and frequencies of such unarticulated answers are heightened and their relevance and importance have never been greater. Both partners have questions of their own—reflecting their inner struggles— questions they can't even articulated to themselves but whose answers are begging to come out. And then there are those questions about the relationship that both partners share—questions that elude an answer not necessarily because the questions are poetic but because the answers are located farther into the future. Is there any other place we can be so inarticulate than in a relationship?\n\nI feel like it is so easy to just follow tradition, impulse, what we are used to, just to keep the wheel going, just to cope with the day in a relationship. To face the questions we cannot articulate and to try to even answer them requires a lot of courage. But those who do face them—or just acknowledge their existence—and respect their power, I think will have a richer experience all through out.\n\nBut sometimes, these inarticulate questions, these questions that eludes words, whose answer are only felt—sometimes, if not most of the time, they do not require an answer. What they are simply asking for is for us to learn to be comfortable not articulating certain things— at least for now. They teach us to be comfortable with not knowing, to live and flourish in that space between question and answer and to let go of the need to have an answer now or at all.\n\nThere are things I wanted to tell you. There are things I wanted to ask. But I couldn't tell them now. I couldn't ask them now. Could you stay with me until I understand them myself enough for me to share them with you?",

But such is the case of many scholars: they have read themselves stupid. For constant reading immediately taken up again in every free moment is even more mentally paralysing than constant manual labour, since in the latter we can still muse about our own thoughts.

By worldview, I mean how he sees the world and how he should live in it.\n\nTo use a metaphor, Thoreau's Walden was an act of drawing a map of the terrain and navigates that terrain. It was, therefore, an act of independnt intellectual emancipation and living that rebellion at the same time. His experiment was a combination of intellectual reasoning and experience.\n\nHe had to build his worldview because he can no longer rely on anyone to build it for him. He refuses to depend on any outside authority to dictate how he should live.\n\nThoreau created his own personal religion.\n\nHow different are we from him?\n\nWe are not.\n\nWe have the same questions to answer—they are inescapable: How should I live? Where do I get instructions for living? How do i understand the world?\n\nUnless we want to live an unexamined life running on autopilot, these are questions that have to be grappled with. Thoreau had to live in a cabin in the woods for two years to answer these questions and he continued answering them after his experiment. Not that he didn't think about them before Walden (he already was) but Walden was his most daring attempt to answer and live the questions.\n\nToday, many of us don't have the luxury of living for two years in a cabin in the woods. But like Thoreau, we can't escape the questions. Its all a matter of \"when\" do we start getting serious about them. \"When\" do we face our invisible Waldens to build our invisible cabins and start thinking about the questions seriously. When do we say \"Enough. I am answering the questions myself. I will build my own worldview. I will live this life according to my own will.\"\n\n# References",

    "content": "\nWhy Thoreau?\n\n- Thoreau thus saw the end of one geological epoch and the beginning of the next\n\nChronology\n\n- Birth\n   - Born: July 12, 1817\n   - 1816, “Year without a Summer”\n   - 1815, Indonesia’s Mount Tambora erupted, the largest volcanic event in over 1,300 years\n   - on July 12, 1817, Cynthia gave birth to a healthy baby boy. They called him Henry, but then, only six weeks later, John’s little brother David died, just after coming of age at twenty-one. So on October 12, when it came time to bring their infant son to the First Parish Church for baptism, they followed family custom and kept the name alive: the Reverend Ezra Ripley baptized their second son David Henry Thoreau.\n- Childhood\n   - His family kept transferring from one house to another.\n   - It was a barefoot, knockabout childhood—rough, unfussy, and close to the soil, with animals everywhere.\n   - Even as a child, his spirit longed for “that sweet solitude,”\n   - His mother told a friend how, when Henry and John still slept together in a trundle bed, “John would go to sleep at once, but Henry often lay long awake. His mother found the little boy lying so one night, long after he had gone upstairs, and said, ‘Why, Henry dear, why don’t you go to sleep?’ ‘Mother’ said he, ‘I have been looking through the stars to see if I couldn’t see God behind them.’”\n- Harvard\n   - in a mere four hours “a young man of any capacity at all” could easily accomplish the day’s tasks, leaving him lots of time to pursue his own bent “unimpeded.”\n      - For Thoreau this meant walking off into the countryside to observe birds or hunt for nests and eggs.\n      - It also meant daily trips to Harvard’s tremendous library, the best in the nation.\n   - LANGUAGES: Thoreau went on to make languages his special project.\n      - By the time he graduated, Thoreau could read at least five foreign languages—Latin, Greek, Italian, French, and German—plus a little Spanish and Portuguese. On his own he studied Wampanoag, the Native American language of eastern Massachusetts\n   - MATHEMATICS: Thoreau’s flair for mathematics might have put him in the advanced study group who met at Peirce’s home in the evenings.\n   - SCIENCE: The man who truly introduced Thoreau to science was not a professor at all, but the college’s shy and modest librarian, beloved by generations of students: Thaddeus William Harris.\n      - In May 1837, he joined forces with Thoreau and friends to found Harvard’s Natural History Society, leading them on field excursions around Cambridge in pursuit of plants, birds, and insects.\n   - PHILOSOPHY: By the time he graduated, Thoreau was saturated with Harvard rationalism at its finest, even as outside the classroom he was finding his way to the very writers and intellectuals who were about to topple it all.\n   - Harvard “nearly ruined him as a writer.”\n      - Every term for three long years, Edward Tyrrel Channing, the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory, issued Thoreau a long series of assignments, every one of which he collected, corrected, and returned, scored on Quincy’s merciless eight-point scale. If Thoreau kept a journal through these years, it is lost; if he wrote letters home, they are gone; when he ventured into poetry, his verses mostly vanished.42 What survives are his essays for Channing. They disappoint.\n      - The young and earnest Henry Thoreau learned so well how to write for his teacher that it took ten years and a move to Walden Pond to shake himself free.\n   - How Thoreau broke the spell of Harvard and started his life as a philosopher\n      - Brownson\n         - This was Thoreau’s first encounter with a free-range intellectual for whom ideas snapped and crackled, who moved easily in the circles of the great and the near great. His term with Brownson broke the spell of Harvard.\n         - To Thoreau, the scholarship boy struggling to pay his tuition bills, Brownson’s words hit home. To Brownson, education was the key to creating true equality, which meant the key to remedying all the evils of society. He didn’t mean reading, writing, and ciphering; he meant real education, “the formation of character, the moral, religious, intellectual, and physical training, disciplining, of our whole community.”\n         - Thoreau was living with Brownson at the very moment he was writing his breakthrough book, New Views of Society, Christianity, and the Church, which soon joined Emerson’s Nature as a founding text of Transcendentalism.\n         - Thoreau was testing out Transcendentalism on his own well before it existed as a movement.\n   - Six weeks with Wheeler at a cabin in Flint’s Pond one summer\n      - One could say that Henry Thoreau made a similar vow. His experiment at Walden Pond had its origin here, in these weeks spent living and writing with Charles Stearns Wheeler.\n- After Harvard: Public School Teacher\n   - Feeling rootless and cut off from the person he had been, Thoreau was confessing anxiety over his new identity as a Harvard graduate and a young man of promise. It was around this time that he changed his name, reversing the baptismal “David Henry” to his preferred “Henry David.”\n   - teacher of Concord’s Center Grammar School\n      - Thoreau made clear when he was hired that he would not flog his students for disobedience, but “talk morals as a punishment instead.”\n      - That evening, having completed his act of “uncivil obedience,” Thoreau went before Deacon Ball and resigned. Next day he returned to tell his students that punishing with force went against his conscience: “He wouldn’t keep school any longer, if that was the way he had to do it.”\n      - Thus ten days after it began, Thoreau’s career as a public schoolteacher was over.\n- Transcendental Apprentice\n   - Journal\n      - Thoreau carefully commemorated Sunday, October 22, 1837, as nothing less than his second Lebenstag, the day that gave him birth as a writer.\n      - “‘What are you doing now?’ he asked, ‘Do you keep a journal?’—So I make my first entry today.”\n      - Emerson from “Human Culture\"\n         - solitude and journal-keeping work together: solitude is not for empty reverie but for the productive habit of exploring, pen in hand\n         - Thoreau’s response to that call inaugurated a monumental life’s work, an epic journey of over two million words, sustained as long as he could hold a pen.\n   - Solitude\n      - the budding writer hungered for solitude. Henry took a room in the attic—what he called his “upper empire,” from whose “perspective window” he could look out on the sunrise and see “all things . . . in their true relations.”\n         - There in that upper empire he wrote up his first lecture for the Concord Lyceum, on April 11, 1838, on “Society.”\n   - **Making a living**\n      - **Pencil factory**\n      - **The Thoreau School**\n         - In mid-June, 1838, Henry Thoreau opened a school of his own, right in the Parkman House.\n         - **Teaching philosophy**\n            - education should be a pleasure both for teacher and student, and discipline should be the same in the classroom as in the street; that is, not the cowhide whip but life itself.\n            - To transmit that spark, the teacher should be a student, too, learning with and from his pupils. But such teaching “supposes a degree of freedom which rarely exists”—the freedom to liberate the self.\n\n(What details about Thoreau’s background are relevant in informing his creativity?)\n\n# References\n\nWalls, L.

The former identity is clear. The new identity is unknown and still underconstruction.\n\n## A Liminal Wilderness\n\n- Introduce the concept of [[Liminality]] from Van Genep.\n- Discuss how Turner extended Van Genep's conceptualization of liminality.\n- Present briefly how the concept of liminality has been used throughout history.\n- Segue into how individuals experience periods of liminality.\n- Segue into religious liminality.\n- Present my history of how I became an ex-Jehovah's Witness.\n- Describe my experience of religious liminality.\n\t- Lots of uncertainty. Tendency to be unsure. Related to this was difficulty to commit. Uncover journal entries and notes about this and perhaps quote at least one.\n\t- Mention the state of your spirituality. Transitioning from a fundamentalist Christian textual life to one that is atheistic, agnostic, and almost religious naturalism, where spiritual emotions I used to have in the context of church I now experience alone under nature while moving.\n- State that in my experience, I wasn't immediately aware that I was in a state of religious liminality. Even if the evidence points to it, I did not articulate this clearly. Further, I was not talking to my past religious identity, thinking that it is something I have to completely avoid and leave.\n- Daily walking, which culminated to the long walk, seem to have opened something in me, and so I turned to the literature on walking.\n\n## Walking Liminality\n\n- The desire to walk is most probably a physical expression (a symptom) of liminality. One could even say, walking is performed liminality.\n\t- Mention Craig Mod who has connected his desire to walk Japan with his background as an adopted child and a foreigner in a country far from home. His attraction to mobility also coincides with his attraction to material culture, specifically architecture, photography, and food. As if abandoned by society, people in liminal states cling to the material world for refuge.\n\t- After leaving church, I have always felt called by nature, physical space, and the outdoors. It was as if my subconscious was telling me, \"You don't belong in any social circle. Perhaps it is in geographic space, in land, in matter, where you belong.\" For a long time I actually may have believed that.\n\t- Also, it became clear to me that I was walking because I was largely unsure: unsure of where I was going in life and who I was as a person. And being unsure, I chose to do what seems like a physical manifestation of this uncertainty: walking. And my appreciation to long walks, or short almost daily walks, reflected this need to express uncertainty through my body while at the same time hoping that perhaps through it, I could recreate mmyself.\n\t- An argument can also be made that the photographs I took while on these walks potray images of limen. For example, I was interestingly attracted to abandoned and derelict spaces, which are tightly related to how liminality is applied in architecture.\n\t\t- Share a few photogaph specimens here.\n- Say that there is something about walking that helps one traverse a liminimal state. \"Walking carries with it the possibility for the exploration of the liminal\" (Hickey et al., 2018).\n\t- According to ethnographers who used walking, walking has several characteristics that makes correspondence between researcher and researched easier.\n\t\t- Present these characteristics.\n\t\t\t- Walking opens the space for informality and candor within oneself as autoethngrapher (the researcher and the researched).\n\t\t\t\t- Walking allows the self to be \"messy, uncertain, and multivoiced\" (Denzin \u0026 Lincoln, 2005, p. 26).\n\t\t\t- Walking opens moments of experimental encounter\n\t\t\t- Identity/ies are negotiated while traversing space\n\n## Walking as Autoethnography\n\n- Walking can also be applied in autoethnography.\n\t- In autoethnography, the researcher is also the participant.\n\t- Walking unveils the liminal space and the distance between Old Self and New Self.\n\t- Walking provides a means to cross this liminal space between Old Self and New Self.\n\t\t- It makes the self relaxed and trust. Conversation with oneself is more natural compared to say journaling in a desk, natural breaks are allowed, and visual cues in the environment become prompts for reflection. For example, one afternoon, while walking, I noticed a long line of flowers with two colors. At first, I thought they grew from different plants: one flower being a variant of the other. Upon closer inspection, I was surprised to learn that the flowers, although different in color, grow from the same plant. I would later learn that these were Umbrellaworts or more commonly known as Four O'clocks, whose flowers open around the time of my afternoon walks, thus seeing them. This visual drama triggered thoughts on community. One of the things I lost after leaving my childhood religion was community. As a JW, I interacted with individuals who believed the same things I believe in on almost a daily basis. This was lost after I left. I tried hard even until now to find community and accepting that being in a liminal space such as where I am right now means coming at peace to the fact that I won't be connected to people I share similar beliefs with as easily as before and that differences and learning to navigate differences shall now be my norm. Walking and noticing umbrellaworts and how two flowers of different colors could grow from the same plant made me ask whether it is possible to grow community despite differences.\n\t- “inbetween realm, which forms a third place, or threshold, that links as it separates two previously opposed conditions.” (Coleman, 2005, p. 202)\n\t- I argue that walking can be used by a researcher in a state of liminality to understand how their New Self Becoming relates to their Old Self. Walking does this by opening up correspondence.\n\t\t- Example: Before the long walk to San Pablo, I avoided my past as a JW. However, after the walk, my journal entries started to suggest that I was interested in inquiring about how my past could inform what I am currently doing, specifically that I am still performing work that can easily be considered \"religious.\" Show examples of these journal entries.\n\t\t- This correspondence that has opened between my New Self Becoming and my Old Self transforms the identity of both selves.\n\t\t\t- The ambulatory inquiry that happens through walking provokes an encounter with the environment, the Old Self, the New Self Becoming, and the New Self, that ever elusive ideal that one attempts to eventually become. As the autoethnographer walks and receives stimuli from encounters to geographic space and experience, their multiple identities change.\n\t\t\t- This identity transformation results to identity integration.\n\t\t\t- I now accept that somehow, walking now seems to be a way to revisit my past as a Jehovah's Witness preaching to the Deaf, some of whom are scatterred around the hills of Baguio City and La Trinidad, Benguet. However, since I could no longer do that as I have left the church, walking has become a way for me to re-do my identity in a different context.\n\n\n## Perpetual Liminality\n\n- State that the original conceptualization for liminality is that it eventually ends. In identity discourse, this means that someone who left a former identity should one day be able to leave a state of liminality and find a new identity that they will embrace.\n- But identity is ever-changing. Further, there is reason to believe that some individuals choose to stay in perpetual liminality, never truly belonging to exisiting social frameworks and, therefore, are constantly recreated.\n- Contrast my old self and my new self becoming. Highlight that perhaps there is never an arrival. That we are always becoming and that this is okay.\n- In terms of religious identity, enter ideas from Andrew James Brown, specifically the idea \"the freedom to be tomorrow what we are not today.\"\n- Circle back to walking.\n\t- We have to use the body to remind us of of our perpetual liminality, lest we become static and embody that existential stasis. Mobility through methods like walking reminds us of this constant becoming, helps us embrace it, helps us traverse liminal spaces, and perhaps even, find ourselve feeling at home en route to nowhere.\n",

Worse, the freelancer could be so attached to his identity that he refuses to take the next step: becoming an entrepreneur.\n\nA healthier mindset is to look at one's work life as an investment portfolio where all sources of income are allowed and viable. If taking on a job right now makes sense, include it in your portfolio and use that to remove stress and free you with the mental space and time needed to build your ideal business.\n\n## References",

I can go out, look at objects, and contemplate. However, I argue that photography, and videography by extension, facilitates the nurturing of this strength in a way that makes it easier. This is because, looking for a shot and an angle motivates one to look closer. With a camera, looking closer is inevitable because one has a purpose: to get the best shot. And for some, who choose to share their images to the public, this process even becomes more intentional.\n\nAll of this contributes to the freshness of appreciation of the objects being looked at.\n\n**To Do**\n- Include research from Laurie Santos about the dangers of sharing on social media.\n\n# References\n",

    "title": "Pivot by Jenny Blake",
    "content": "\n# Introduction - Pivot is the New Normal\n\nPivot\n\n- “A change in strategy without a change in vision.”\n\nCareer Pivot\n\n- A change you make of your own volition when you have reached a point in your career when you are ready for increased challenge and impact.\n- Shifting to new, related work by leveraging one's existing base of strengths, interests, and experience.\n- Doubling down on what is working to make a purposeful shift in a new, related direction.\n- An intentional, methodical process for nimbly navigating career changes.\n- Not starting from scratch.\n- Pivoting throughout our careers is plan A, is the new normal.\n- Your entire career is a series of pivots.\n\nBenefits of learning how to pivot\n\n- By doubling down on what is working best while thinking about how to develop into what’s next, you accelerate the experimentation and change process. You can proceed with confidence, knowing that you already have what it takes to get where you want to go.\n\nWhy extensive planning is wrong\n\n- “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.”\n- You don’t have to specify the details of your life in five years.\n- The challenge now is to be present. In doing so, we stay awake to the dots that are in front of us.\n\nHow to connect dots\n\n- It is possible to connect at least one or two dots looking forward.\n- Connect the dots by looking back and then forward to make career connections in real time not waiting too long until we are burned out, unhappy, or force to make a change.\n- Connect your career dots looking backward to see how each related area led to the next.\n- Let go of fears about what can or should or might happen. Zoom back in to where you are right now, and where you want to go next. That is all you have to do. Once you make your next move, you will collect the experience and real-world data to plan the move after that.\n\n“Each time you repeat a task, take one step toward automating it.”\n\n- Because you will go into a lot of career iterations, you have to get better in making the process of tackling change easier every time.\n\n4 Stages of the Pivot Method\n\n1. Plant - set a strong foundation\n2. Scan - stay rooted while exploring options\n3. Pilot - test ideas and get feedback to generate perspectives and opportunities\n4. Launch - pursue the new direction\n\nBridge the gap between where you are now and where you want to be.\n\nPlant\n\n- Foundation: values, strengths, interests\n- One-year vision\n- Who you are already\n- What is already working\n- How will you define success for the next phase of your life\n\nScan\n\n- Exploration phase\n- Research new and related skills (identify and plug knowledge and skill gaps)\n- Talk to others (have a wide variant of conversations)\n- Map potential opportunities\n\nPilot\n\n- Series of small, low-risk experiments to test your new direction\n- Help gather real-time data and feedback\n- Adjust incrementally as you go\n- Not relying on blind leaps\n\nLaunch\n\n- The big move\n- Bigger decisions\n- Require commitment even in the face of remaining uncertainty\n- Repeat the first three stages to reduce risk and give you a greater chance of success\n- Doing so will take you 80 to 90 percent of the way toward your goal\n- Launch = pulling the trigger on the remaining 10 or 20 percent\n\nThe Pivot Cycle\n\n![Screen Shot 2017-01-09 at 7.10.26 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8/doc/699B9110-20DC-4B9C-A7B1-68E67D172740/F208C528-17B3-4A85-B03F-436A6732C1EC_2/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-09%20at%207.10.26%20PM.png)\n\nHow long will a pivot take\n\n- Cycle; not one-and-done\n- Can take 1 month to years\n- Several pivots towards destination\n- Bigger pivots require several small turns\n- Repeat the Plant-Scan-Pilot process as many times as necessary to gain clarity and gather feedback before advancing to the fourth stage, Launch.\n\nPivot timing depends on\n\n- The scope of your change\n- How far your ideal end state is from where you are now\n- Your risk threshold\n- Your savings runway\n- Your expertise and reputation\n- The complexity of what you are building toward.\n\nIndicato to where you are in the cycle\n\n- Results are the indicator of where you are in your pivot.\n- Are you experiencing momentum and fulfillment?\n- The income and energy that you desire?\n- If not, you will return to the earlier Pivot stages to determine what adjustments to make.\n\nSurrender to our career path\n\n- We are not in total control of our careers.\n- Our careers are working on our behalf behind the scenes.\n- Admit that we cannot plan in perfect specificity how the next years of our lives will unfold.\n- Make way for curiosity and serendipity.\n- Release the illusion of security within a fixed future.\n- Allow life to surprise you.\n- The only move that matters is your next one.\n\nPivot mindset\n\n- Shifting naturally within your role and from one position into the next, while remaining open to a wide variety of options along the way.\n- Dip in and out of self-employment.\n- The most successful entrepreneurs I know are adept at working with companies, consulting for them as clients as they build their own businesses.\n- If change is the only constant, let’s get better at it.\n\n# High Net Growth\n\n[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6\u0026q=16.056629,120.453584)\n\nImpacters\n\n- Unwilling to settle for a career of phoning it in.\n- High net growth and impact over high net worth.\n- Love learning, taking action, tackling new projects, and solving problems.\n- Generous and cooperative\n- Imbued with a strong desire to make a difference\n- Aim for a sense of momentum and expansion\n- When their inward desire for growth is being met, they turn their attention outward, seeking to make a positive impact on their families, companies, communities, and global societies.\n- Often these happen in tandem; by seeking problems they can fix and tackling them, impacters meet their needs for exploration and challenge, uncovering callings along the way.\n- Allergic to stagnation, boredom, and anything that is fixed.\n- Boredom = symptom of fulfillment deficiency (no growth and impact)\n- Continue learning and contributing throughout their working lives.\n\nMost successful people\n\n- Those with growth mindset.\n- People who believe that their basic qualities are things they can cultivate through their efforts.\n- Gifts or lack of them are not fixed traits.\n\nGrowth Mindset\n\n- “The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset.”\n- “This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.”\n\nWhy a growth mindset is important in pivoting\n\n- By seeing change as an opportunity, rather than a personal shortcoming or obstacle, you will be much more likely to find creative solutions based on what excites you, rather than subpar choices clouded by fear.\n- Be open to new ideas.\n- Be observant in your experimentation.\n- Be deliberate in your implementation.\n- Be flexible in the face of change.\n\n3 orientations\n\n1. Job orientation - work as means to pay the bills\n2. Career orientation - success, status, and prestige\n3. Calling orientation - work is integral to their lives, a core part of their identity and a fulfilling reward in itself.\n\nImpacters fall in the second and aspire for the third if they are not yet there.\n\nImpacters and money\n\n- Money is important but prioritizes growth and impact.\n- What did I learn?

    "content": "\nLyrical forms like poetry and narrative are exploratory in nature. They present their own history. Instead of simply stating their arrival, they include how they arrive. They use story to present ideas rather than explanation.\n\n# References\n\nKlagge, J. (2021). _Wittgenstein’s Artillery: Philosophy as Poetry_. The MIT Press.\n\n\u003eWallace Stevens, in “Of Modern Poetry” (1940), defines a poem as “the mind in the act of finding / What will suffice.” This seems to me to be true of any work organized lyrically: poems, certain sorts of essays, certain sorts of fiction. We see in such work a mind moving—noting and considering, listening to what it has just said, leaping forward or turning back. Rather than reporting on what will suffice, speaking from a position of arrival, this kind of writing dramatizes the act of getting there. What we do when we read such work, as Kenneth Burke illustrates …, is reenact that movement. We perform the poem, connecting image to image or turn to turn, making of its various parts a coherent inner action: “For a poem is an act, the symbolic act of the poet who made it—an act of such a nature that, in surviving as a structure or an affect, it enables us as readers to re-enact it.”\n\u003eA poem, we might say, gives us instructions for re-enacting its inner movements.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe act of “reporting on what will suffice, speaking from a position of arrival” is what one usually finds in philosophical writing. It is a natural way to set out a philosophical position.\n\u003e\n\u003eBut Gardner suggests that what characterizes a poem, in his broad sense, is that it “dramatizes the act of getting there.” Here we see the importance of Wittgenstein’s dialogical style. Whether we see the style as deriving from his experience in the classroom or not, we are offered a sort of path that gives us, the readers, the opportunity to “re-enact that movement.”\n\u003e\n\u003eOne must start out with error [_Irrtum_] and convert [_überführen_] it into truth.\n\u003eThat is, one must reveal the source of error, otherwise hearing the truth won’t do any good. The truth cannot force its way in when something else is occupying its place.\n\u003eTo convince someone of the truth, it is not enough to state it, but rather one must find the _path_ [_Weg_] from error to truth.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe poem must not only enable us, but _engage_ us, to reenact the movement of thought of the poet.\n\u003e\n\u003eThis will be different for each writer, of course, but the task of the invisible audience is the same—to track the drama, to recreate it internally, to find its motion within ourselves.",

    "content": "\n[[thoughts/poetry]] is appreciation training. Poetry is noticing—celebrating the moment—the truest truth. It is much like photography in this regard ([[Photography is mindfulness training]]). But it is a bit more complex as it uses words, which allow you to capture abstract concepts.\n\nIn poetry, we employ [[Appreciation of beauty and excellence ]] as well as [[Renewed freshness of appreciation]]. Both rely on our ability to be present to what is happening now—baring withness to it. We do this in poetry, although [[Photography]] does this best ([[Photography is the art closest to the present moment]]).\n\nIn the art of living, truth is important and it has a prominent place. But existing, being, meaning-making—these are the practical side of the art of life, which could even be more important than searching for the truth. And here, is where poetry can elevate a life. It can provide more meaning to the present moment and the life in general. Poetry elevates life by changing our minds, how we look at small moments. It is all about seeing. In the same vein, photography is like poetry as both are about framing.\n\nYou cannot include everything in a poem, same with a photograph. But that is exactly what the present moment needs. You need to single it out in order for it to rise above the larger picture, where it will only drown. Singling it out allows it to shine, to avoid competition with others. We are able to give all of our attention to it.\n\n# References\n",

If there is one word to describe my day, or my entire life, at present, that word will be \"practice.\"\n\nEverything for me now is a practice. When I wake up in the morning I do asanas on my mat, I write in my journal, I read a good book, I meditate. After this set of morning rituals, I eat breakfast where I try to be present with the food on the table and the people around me.\n\nAfter breakfast, I do what most of us do. I work, which itself is a continuous practice. In the afternoon, at around 4 or 5 pm, I ride my bike to my favorite trail, a two-kilometer dirt path across rice fields, which is usually quiet at this time of the day.\n\nWhile there, the muse visits me, I begin to write poems and intuitive prose. I begin to see camera angles and story-filled compositions. As the sun begins its descent, I park my bike and stand still behind it. I look at the horizon and stare at the crimson sky.\n\nI know that these experiences might seem like a privilege for some but I also believe that all of us can make room for these \"free\" moments if only we choose to. We should strive to seek beauty in the ordinary monotony of everyday life.\n",

Human being's primary purpose is to be present in whatever they do. This is a purpose about quality of action. The secondary purpose refers to anything one wants to do. It is a purpose concerning content.\n\nFor Eckhart Tolle, primary purpose is always primary, and this purpose is everchanging because when we are concsciously moving, we know where each of our actions are going and we focus on that, we are present on that. In other words, the journey towards the fulfillment of a secondary purpose is the primary purpose. The secondary purpose, which describes an [[End state]], becomes primary when it finally reaches the Now.\n\nThe state of concsiousness is primary; everything else is secondary.\n\nThat said, [[We can live without articulating our purpose]].\n\n**To do**\n\n- It is time to challenge this.

    "content": "\n[[2022-08-10]]\n\nI tried making Quartz work for me. The original plan was to follow this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITiiuBNVue0\u0026t=369s. I like it because it addressed privacy issues. But then, I went through all sorts of problem with implementing it. For example, I went through the trouble of setting my GOPATH, which is a basic for go programmers, but something I only learned now. Through this, I learned that the Mac terminal has different shells: bash, zshrc, and fish. Setting my GOPATH correctly relies on a knowledge of what amont these shells' profiles must be edited. I now know the answer, and I might be able to pull Quartz off, but while looking for alternatives, I think I have found a better option, which addresses privacy (using .gitignore) plus a bigger framework of doing this.\n\nThe alternatives I tried included Obsidian Zola (because of its alleged easy process of adding a single file in the obsidian vault) and the alternatives in this [article](https://beingpax.medium.com/7-obsidian-publish-alternatives-to-publish-your-notes-online-for-free-33db4fb06f5). Among these alternatives, I would have wanted to use Mathieu [Dutour's Gatsby Digital Garden](https://beingpax.medium.com/how-to-publish-your-obsidian-notes-online-for-free-851af90e797). However, I went through a lot of trouble installing Gatsby and its dependencies so I gave it up.\n\nI discovered other interesting options like [blot.im](https://blot.im/), which is easy to use but doesn't really support the complexity I need for my site. [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), which was claimed to be an easy and fast option, but well, not really. [Mindstone](https://mindstone.tuancao.me/) was an option, but it shows everything, impossible to support privacy, typography is bad and just looks a lot like obsidian publish, which looks bad (good idea I can't afford it anyway). \n\nBefore walking, the last option I played with involved [11ty digital garden theme](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden). I would have used this if not for its too poor design, and because I discovered Maggie Appleton's wonderful [github repo](https://github.com/maggieappleton/digital-gardeners). I browsed the list of digital gardens there, and read one of her essays at her website about digital gardening for non-technical people.\n\nI also encountered Sveltekit, Dendron, Innos Note, and Hyperdraft.\n\nWhat really worked for me though was the Jekyll + Obsidian workflow of [Hiran Venugopalan](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io). I decided to go with this direction after watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_oGnpe3g6g\u0026list=PLfFmPgPyv2xfHPlETx4o0luhtOBBe2QfE\u0026index=5) and pondering about the design of [Maggie's website](https://maggieappleton.com). In both sites, the site is the digital garden. The essays and blog posts are integrated with the notes and the notes with the essays and posts. Salman's process of using Obsidian makes a lot of sense. If I put the site folder and the notes folder in one vault, I could easily link them to each other. This gives Obsidian a more robust function (if only it could edit gitignore and other files, it might even be my choice of editor). But now, I could write my notes there and my essays at the same time.\n\n[[2022-08-11]]\n\nTried deploying jekyll blog on cloudflare. It worked. But then I realized how limited its functionalities are so I committed to using quartz.\n\n[[2022-08-12]]\n\n- Read [A Brief History \u0026 Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and wrote some links to check.\n- Learned how to use .gitignore file.\n- I used frontmatter for tags in Obsidian.\n- Decided to put all notes under /content directly.\n- I looked for Filipino and Pangasinan words to find a word to refer to my second brain.\n\n[[2022-08-13]]\n\n- Discovered forest garden as a useful metaphor for my second brain\n- Continued modifying notes YAML.\n- Played around with Operand.\n\n[[2022-08-14]]\n\n- I learned how to fork a repository correctly: fork all its branches, clone it to your local machine, and push to hugo when ready.

How do other digital gardeners share their work and build a following?\n\n[[Hundred Rabbits]]\n- They publish a monthly newsletter via TinyLetter. The newsletter is just a short one to two-paragraph piece that contains links to changes in their software and new page addditions to their digital garden website.\n\n[[Maggie Appleton]]\n- No newsletter. You can get updated with changes in the forest via RSS.\n\n[[Andy Matuschak]]\n- No newsletter. He has a subscription form in his website but doesn't really send emails. He seems to engage with a curated  audience in Patreon.\n\nGwern.net\n- Monthly newsletter. No longer updated since April 2021\n\nNikita\n- No newsletter. Shares on Twitter and IG. GitHub. Has a Telegram group.\n\nSwxy\n- has a newsletter. But no longer updates. Getrevue.co\n\nhttps://aengusmcmillin.com/newsletter\n- substack\n- Weekly\n- Progresses and recommendations\n\n## My solution\n\nIntellectual work produces lots of notes and artifacts in my forest garden. These accumulates. If I do a monthly piece like Hundred Rabbits, I end up with a lenghty almost unreadable piece. An obvious solution is to cut the publishing process to weekly. I will still do a quick newsletter linking to works from the forest garden.\n\nThe only problem with weekly newsletters is I had a hard time maintaining them in the past. If I will do them, here are rules I need to follow:\n- Do not be compelled to share everything in the forest garden, just the best hits and the most related to your life work's main theme: the quest to wisdom.\n- Do not write an essay. You won't sustain a weekly one.\n- Start a newsletter somewhere new like Substack.\n- Filter out existing subscribers by sending new opt in form.\n- Write an introductory newsletter to new members and introduce the newsletter.\n- Make the form simple. Just point to the best hits in your forest garden.\n\nRemember that you have two goals when writing:\n1. Primary: To process my thoughts, experiences, and emotions so I can improve understanding.\n2. Secondary: To leave footprints and archetypes for others in a similar path to make use of in their own journeys.\n\n# References",

It is \"a set of highly learnable skills.\" At the same time, it \"is in the core of all\"—it is human nature. And yet, Rem says, we often misunderstand it.\n\nThe website aims to help readers rethink what Love is and discover different ways of using it in practical matters. But Pathfinder's Commune (PC) is more than just a website. It is a \"radical learning pathway\" that combines \"classroom learning, support group, informal discussions, get-together, and spiritual retreat\" all in the aim of understanding Love's essence.\n\nIn PC, Rem's love for teaching is evident. It will take a while before he would train in facilitation via Ginhawa where I first met him. But around this time (2012), Rem was a teacher. Based on my experience of his work, he never really let go of this teaching mindset and, instead, combined it with his facilitation.\n\nFacilitation has a different approach to guiding learners compared to teaching. A facilitator is like a librarian who simply provides learners suggestions and resources that they can use in creating their own self-directed learning project. Facilitors do not direct the flow of learning; they simply provide support when requested. Their success is measured by how much they could stay in the background. A teacher, on the other hand, formulates the learning path and demonstrates it so that the student can follow. Although not all of them act this way, teachers are often expected to be holders of knowledge that they pour into the empty heads of students. Unlike the facilitator who directs learners to resources, the teacher is the resource.\n\nRem was both a teacher and facilitator because he can both be a resource and a guide to other resources. He experimented and perhaps perfected this combination in his last course and community, Tungko ng Tula. When he created the curriculum for the course, he was in teacher mode. But when he presented the curriculum to the group, he let his students mold the curriculum based on their own biases and experiences, never really preaching a single interpretation of the curriculum. In fact, especially in the first iteration of the course, the curriculum served simply as a structure but not really a content for the course. The content was what came our of the conversations that the structure prompted.\n\nRem directs the flow of classses by introducing activities, questions, and assignments, but he does not do all of the talking. He allows students to do the talking and from the inputs of the students, inform the next lesson. This was most pronounced in the first iteration of Tungko ng Tula, when Rem created the lessons in between classes.\n\nPersonally, I would have liked Rem to totally let go of the curriculum and be more of a facilitator to empower us to teach ourselves. But reading his overview of PC made me understand where Rem came from. Tungko ng Tula was his first experiment in combining teaching and facilitation and he nailed it. Given more time, perhaps, he could have realized that he was more of a facilitator than a teacher (or vice versa).",

To recognize the always-presupposed material reality of the people who constitute the social group, even when this reality has not been conceptualized by the group’s members, one should also include the contributions of their bodies, habits, physical culture, and social structures. To include this dimension mnemonically, one can add a “fourth C”, for community. Catherine Albanese (1981) may have been the first to propose the idea of adding this materialist dimension.\n\u003e \n\u003e In an attempt to dislodge the focus on human subjectivity found in the three Cs, some have argued that the material dimension is the source of the others. They argue, in other words, that the cognitive, affective, and conative aspects of the members of a social group are not the causes but rather the effects of the group’s structured practices (e.g., Asad 1993: ch. 1–4; Lopez 1998).\n\n## Structure vs agency (institution vs. individual) debate\n\n\u003e Some argue that to understand religion in terms of beliefs, or even in terms of any subjective states, reflects a Protestant bias and that scholars of religion should therefore shift attention from hidden mental states to the visible institutional structures that produce them. Although the structure/agency debate is still live in the social sciences, it is unlikely that one can give a coherent account of religion in terms of institutions or disciplinary practices without reintroducing mental states such as judgements, decisions, and dispositions (Schilbrack 2021).\n\n## Polythetic definitions of religion are illogical\n\nPolythetic definitions of religion reject the idea that a concept or entity needs to have some essence. In doing so, polythetic definitions reject [[The law of identity (P is P)]] and therefore lead to logical contradictions and flawed thinking.\n\n\u003e That a concept always corresponds to something possessing a defining property is a very old idea.\n\u003e \n\u003e The traditional assumption is that every entity has some essence that makes it the thing it is, and every instance that is accurately described by a concept of that entity will have that essence. The recent argument that there is an alternative structure—that a concept need not have necessary and sufficient criteria for its application—has been called a “conceptual revolution” (Needham 1975: 351).\n\n## Wittgenstein\n\nSome properties of a concept \"crop up and disappear\"\n\n\u003e In discussions of the concept religion, this anti-essentialist approach is usually traced to Ludwig Wittgenstein (1953, posthumous). Wittgenstein argues that, in some cases, when one considers the variety of instances described with a given concept, one sees that among them there are multiple features that “crop up and disappear”, the result being “a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing” (Wittgenstein 1953, §68). The instances falling under some concepts lack a single defining property but instead have a family resemblance to each other in that each one resembles some of the others in different ways. All polythetic approaches reject the monothetic idea that a concept requires necessary and sufficient criteria. But unappreciated is the fact that polythetic approaches come in different kinds, operating with different logics.\n\n## Polythetic definitions of religion\n\nbounded polythetic approach\nprototypical examples\nborderline\nquasi\n\n\u003e The most basic kind of polythetic approach holds that membership in a given class is not determined by the presence of a single crucial characteristic. Instead, the concept maps a cluster of characteristics and, to count as a member of that class, a particular case has to have a certain number of them, no particular one of which is required.\n\u003e \n\u003e Because this illustration limits the number of characteristics in the properties set, I will call this first kind a “bounded” polythetic approach.\n\u003e \n\u003e Understanding the concept religion in this polythetic way produces a graded hierarchy of instances.\n\u003e \n\u003e Historically speaking, prototypical examples of the concept are likely to be instances to which the concept was first applied. Psychologically speaking, they are also likely to be the example that comes to mind first to those who use the concept.\n\u003e \n\u003e If a form of life has only three, then it would be a borderline example. A form of life that has only two of these characteristics would not be included in the category, though such cases might be considered “quasi-religions” and they might be the most interesting social forms to compare to religions\n\u003e \n\u003e A form of life that only had one of the five characteristics would be unremarkable. The forms of life that had three, four, or five of these characteristics would not be an unrelated set but rather a “family” with multiple shared features, but no one characteristic (not even belief in superempirical beings or powers) possessed by all of them. On this polythetic approach, the concept religion has no essence, and a member of this family that only lacked one of the five characteristics—no matter which one—would still clearly be a religion.\n\u003e \n\u003e Benson Saler (1993) points out, one can use this non-essentialist approach not only for the concept religion but also for the elements within a religion (sacrifice, scripture, and so on) and to individual religions\n\n## Polythetic approaches can still be useful?\n\n\u003e Some have claimed that, lacking an essence, polythetic approaches to religion make the concept so vague that it becomes useless (e.g., Fitzgerald 2000: 72–3; Martin 2009: 167). Given the focused example of a “bounded” approach in the previous paragraph and the widespread adoption of polythetic approaches in the biological sciences, this seems clearly false.\n\n\n\u003e However, it is true that one must pay attention to the parameters at work in a polythetic approach. Using a properties set with only five elements produces a very focused class, but the properties set is simply a list of similarities among at least two of the members of a class, and since the class of religions might have hundreds of members, one could easily create a properties set that is much bigger.\n\u003e \n\u003e there is no reason why one might not work with a properties set for religion with dozens or even hundreds of shared properties.\n\n​\n\n\u003e treating the concept religion in this way can lead to surprising discoveries of patterns within the class and the co-appearance of properties that can lead to explanatory theories.\n\n​\n\n\u003e The second key parameter for a polythetic approach is the threshold number.\n\n​\n\n\u003e each member has a majority of the properties, but this is not a requirement of polythetic approaches. The critics are right that as one increases the size of the properties set and decreases the threshold number, the resulting category becomes more and more diffuse. This can produce a class that is so sprawling that it is difficult to use for empirical study.\n\n​\n\n\u003e Scholars of religion who have used a polythetic approach have typically worked with a “bounded” approach (that is, with a properties set that is fixed), but this is not actually the view for which Wittgenstein himself argues. Wittgenstein’s goal is to draw attention to the fact that the actual use of concepts is typically not bound: “the extension of the concept is not closed by a frontier” (Wittgenstein 1953, §67). We can call this an “open” polythetic approach.\n\n​\n\n\u003e We might say that a bounded polythetic approach produces concepts that are fuzzy, and an open polythetic approach produces concepts that are fuzzy and evolving. Timothy Williamson calls this “the dynamic quality of family resemblance concepts” (1994: 86).\n\n​\n\n\u003e Why do we call something a “religion”? Well, perhaps because it has a direct relationship with several things that have hitherto been called religion; and this can be said to give an indirect relationship to other things we call the same name. (Wittgenstein 1953, §67)\n\n​\n\n\u003e Given an open polythetic approach, a concept evolves in the light of the precedents that speakers recognize, although, over time, what people come to label with the concept can become very different from the original use.\n\n​\n\n\u003e In the academic study of religions, discussions of monothetic and polythetic approaches have primarily been in service of developing a definition of the term.\n\n​\n\n\u003e If one were to offer a lexical definition (that is, a description of what the term means in common usage, as with a dictionary definition), then the definition one offers could be shown to be wrong.\n\n​\n\n\u003e On this point, some believe erroneously that one can correct a definition by pointing to some fact about the referents of the term.\n\n​\n\n\u003e One can correct a real or lexical definition in this way, but not a stipulative definition, that is, a description of the meaning that one assigns to the term. When one offers a stipulative definition, that definition cannot be wrong. Stipulative definitions are assessed not by whether they are true or false but rather by their usefulness, and that assessment will be purpose-relative\n\n​\n\n\u003e De Muckadell (2014) rejects stipulative definitions of religion for this reason, arguing that one cannot critique them and that they force scholars simply to “accept whatever definition is offered”.\n\n​\n\n\u003e However, even without knowing the real essence of religion, one can critique a stipulative definition, either for being less adequate or appropriate for a particular purpose (such as studying forms of life across cultures) or, as with the ice-skating example, for being so far from a lexical definition that it is adequate or appropriate for almost no purpose.\n\n​\n\n\u003e Polythetic definitions are increasingly popular today as people seek to avoid the claim that an evolving social category has an ahistorical essence.[14] However, the difference between these two approaches is not that monothetic definitions fasten on a single property whereas polythetic definitions recognize more. Monothetic definitions can be multifactorial, as we have seen, and they can recognize just as many properties that are “common” or even “typical” of religions, without being essential. The difference is also not that the monothetic identification of the essence of religion reflects an ethnocentrism that polythetic approaches avoid. The polythetic identification of a prototypical religion is equally ethnocentric. The difference between them, rather, is that a monothetic definition sorts instances with a Yes/No mechanism and is therefore digital, and a polythetic definition produces gradations and is therefore analog. It follows that a monothetic definition treats a set of instances that all possess the one defining property as equally religion, whereas a polythetic definition produces a gray area for instances that are more prototypical or less so. This makes a monothetic definition superior for cases (for example, legal cases) in which one seeks a Yes/No answer. Even if an open polythetic approach accurately describes how a concept operates, therefore, one might, for purposes of focus or clarity, prefer to work with a closed polythetic account that limits the properties set, or even with a monothetic approach that limits the properties set to one. That is, one might judge that it is valuable to treat the concept religion as structurally fuzzy or temporally fluid, but nevertheless place boundaries on the forms of life one will compare.\n\n​\n\n\u003e This strategy gives rise to a third kind of polythetic approach, one that stipulates that one property (or one set of properties) is required. Call this an “anchored” polythetic definition. Consistently treating concepts as tools, Wittgenstein suggests this “anchored” idea when he writes that when we look at the history of a concept,\n\n​\n\n\u003e what we see is something constantly fluctuating … [but we might nevertheless] set over against this fluctuation something more fixed, just as one paints a stationary picture of the constantly altering face of the landscape.\n\n​\n\n\u003e Given a stipulated “anchor”, a concept will then possess a necessary property, and this property reintroduces essentialism. Such a definition nevertheless still reflects a polythetic approach because the presence of the required property is not sufficient to make something a religion.\n\n​\n\n\u003e An anchored definition of religion like this would have the benefits of the other polythetic definitions. For example, it would not produce a clear line between religion and nonreligion but would instead articulate gradations between different forms of life (or between versions of one form of life at different times) that are less or more prototypically religious. However, given its anchor, it would produce a more focused range of cases.[15] In this way, the use of an anchor might both reflect the contemporary cosmological view of the concept religion and also address the criticism that polythetic approaches make a concept too vague.\n\n​\n\n\u003e Reflexive scholars have argued that the fact that what counts as religion shifts according to one’s definition reflects an arbitrariness in the use of the term. They argue that the fact that religion is not a concept found in all cultures but rather a tool invented at a certain time and place, by certain people for their own purposes, and then imposed on others, reveals its political character. The perception that religion is a politically motivated conceptual invention has therefore led some to skepticism about whether the concept picks out something real in the world. As with instrumentalism in philosophy of science, then, reflection on religion has raised doubts about the ontological status of the referent of one’s technical term.\n\n​\n\n\u003e A watershed text for the reflexive turn regarding the concept religion is Jonathan Z. Smith’s Imagining Religion (1982).\n\n​\n\n\u003e A central theme of his essays is that the concept religion (and subcategories such as world religions, Abrahamic faiths, or nonliterate traditions) are not scientific terms but often reflect the unrecognized biases of those who use these concepts to sort their world into those who are or are not “like us”.\n\n​\n\n\u003e Smith shows that, again and again, the concept religion was shaped by implicit Protestant assumptions, if not explicit Protestant apologetics.\n\n​\n\n\u003e [T]here is no data for religion. Religion is solely the creation of the scholar’s study. It is created for the scholar’s analytic purposes by his imaginative acts of comparison and generalization. Religion has no independent existence apart from the academy. (1982: xi, italics in original)\n\n​\n\n\u003e Smith is not a nonrealist about religion. In the first place, he did not think that the constructed nature of religion was something particular to this concept: any judgement that two things were similar or different in some respect presupposed a process of selection, juxtaposition, and categorization by the observer.\n\n​\n\n\u003e His slogan is that one’s (conceptual) map is not the same as and should be tested and rectified by the (non-conceptual) territory\n\n​\n\n\u003e Smith did not think that scholars should cease to use religion as a redescriptive or second-order category to study people in history who lacked a comparable concept. On the contrary, he chastised scholars of religion for resting within tradition-specific studies, avoiding cross-cultural comparisons, and not defending the coherence of the generic concept.\n\n​\n\n\u003e Smith did not think that the fact that concepts were human products undermined the possibility that they successfully corresponded to entities in the world: an invented concept for social structures can help one discover religion—not “invent” it—even in societies whose members did not know the concept.\n\n​\n\n\u003e The second most influential book in the reflexive turn in religious studies is Talal Asad’s Genealogies of Religion (1993).\n\n​\n\n\u003e Smith and Asad are therefore examples of scholars who critique the concept religion without denying that it can still refer to something in the world, something that exists even before it is named.\n\n​\n\n\u003e Other critics have gone farther. They build upon the claims that the concept religion is an invented category and that its modern semantic expansion went hand in hand with European colonialism, and they argue that people should cease treating religion as if it corresponds to something that exists outside the sphere of modern European influence. It is common today to hear the slogan that there is no such “thing” as religion. In some cases, the point of rejecting thing-hood is to deny that religion names a category, all the instances of which focus on belief in the same kind of object—that is, the slogan is a rejection of substantive definitions of the concept (e.g., Possamai 2018: ch. 5). In this case, the objection bolsters a functional definition and does not deny that religion corresponds to a functionally distinct kind of form of life. Here, the “no such thing” claim reflects the unsettled question, mentioned above, about the grounds of substantive definitions of “religion”. In other cases, the point of this objection is to deny that religion names a defining characteristic of any kind—that is, the slogan is a rejection of all monothetic definitions of the concept. Perhaps religion (or a religion, like Judaism) should always be referred to in the plural (“Judaisms”) rather than the singular. In this case, the objection bolsters a polythetic definition and does not deny that religion corresponds to a distinct family of forms of life. Here, the “no such thing” claim rejects the assumption that religion has an essence. Despite their negativity, these two objections to the concept are still realist in that they do not deny that the phrase “a religion” can correspond to a form of life operating in the world.\n\n​\n\n\u003e More radically, one sees a denial of this realism, for example, in the critique offered by Wilfred Cantwell Smith (1962).\n\n​\n\n\u003e Smith’s thesis is that in many different cultures, people developed a concept for the individuals they considered pious, but they did not develop a concept for a generic social entity, a system of beliefs and practices related to superempirical realities. Before modernity, “there is no such entity [as religion and] … the use of a plural, or with an article, is false” (1962: 326, 194; cf. 144). Smith recommends dropping religion. Not only did those so described lack the concept, but the use of the concept also treats people’s behavior as if the phrase “a religion” names something in addition to that behavior. A methodological individualist, Smith denies that groups have any reality not explained by the individuals who constitute them. What one finds in history, then, is religious people, and so the adjective is useful, but there are no religious entities above and beyond those people, and so the noun reifies an abstraction.\n\n​\n\n\u003e [n]either religion in general nor any one of the religions … is in itself an intelligible entity, a valid object of inquiry or of concern either for the scholar or for the [person] of faith. (1962: 12)\n\n​\n\n\u003e More radical still are the nonrealists who argue that the concepts religion, religions, and religious are all chimerical. Often drawing on post-structuralist arguments, these critics propose that the notion that religions exist is simply an illusion generated by the discourse about them\n\n​\n\n\u003e Advocates of this position sometimes call their approach the “Critical Study of Religion” or simply “Critical Religion”, a name that signals their shift away from the pre-critical assumption that religion names entities in the world and to a focus on who invented the concept, the shifting contrast terms it has had, and the uses to which it has been put.\n\n​\n\n\u003e Inspired by the post-structuralist critiques that religion does not apply to cultures that lack the concept, some historians have argued that the term should no longer be used to describe any premodern societies, even in Europe.\n\n​\n\n\u003e though it is common to speak of religions existing in the past, human history until the concept emerged in modernity is more accurately understood as a time “before religion”. His aim is “to dispel the commonly held idea that there is such a thing as ‘ancient religion’” (2013: 8).\n\n​\n\n\u003e Citing Nongbri, Carlin Barton and Daniel Boyarin (2016) argue that the Latin religio and the Greek thrēskeia do not correspond to the modern understanding of religion and those studying antiquity should cease translating them with that concept. There was no “Roman religious reality”, they say (2016: 19). These historians suggest that if a culture does not have the concept of X, then the reality of X does not exist for that culture. Boyarin calls this position “nominalism”, arguing that religion is\n\n​\n\n\u003e not in any possible way a “real” object, an object that is historical or ontological, before the term comes to be used. (2017: 25)\n\n​\n\n\u003e These critics are right to draw attention to the fact that in the mind of most contemporary people, the concept religion does imply features that did not exist in ancient societies, but the argument that religion did not exist in antiquity involves a sleight of hand. None of these historians argues that people in antiquity did not believe in gods or other spiritual beings, did not seek to interact with them with sacrifices and other rituals, did not create temples or scriptures, and so on. If one uses Tylor’s definition of religion as belief in spiritual beings or James’s definition of religion as adjusting one’s life to an unseen order—or any of the other definitions considered in this entry—then religion did exist in antiquity. What these historians are pointing out is that ancient practices related to the gods permeated their cultures.\n\n​\n\n\u003e To be sure, ancient people had words to describe proper reverence of the gods, but … [t]he very idea of “being religious” requires a companion notion of what it would mean to be “not religious” and this dichotomy was not part of the ancient world; (2013: 4)\n\n​\n\n\u003e there was no “discrete sphere of religion existing prior to the modern period”\n\n​\n\n\u003e The point is not … that there weren’t practices with respect to “gods” (of whatever sort) but that these practices were not divided off into separate spheres\n\n​\n\n\u003e Steve Mason also argues that religion did not exist in antiquity since religion is “a voluntary sphere of activity, separate in principle” from politics, work, entertainment, and military service (2019: 29). In short, what people later came to conceptualize as religion was in antiquity not a freestanding entity. The nominalist argument, in other words, adds to the definition of the concept religion a distinctively modern feature (usually some version of “the separation of church and state”), and then argues that the referent of this now-circumscribed concept did not exist in antiquity. Their argument is not that religion did not exist outside modernity, but that modern religion did not exist outside modernity.\n\n​\n\n\u003e These post-structuralist and nominalist arguments that deny that religion is “out there” have a realist alternative. According to this alternative, there is a world independent of human conceptualization, and something can be real and it can even affect one’s life, whether or not any human beings have identified it. This is true of things whose existence does not depend on collective agreement, like biochemical signaling cascades or radioactive beta particles, and it is equally true of things whose existence does depend on collective agreement, like kinship structures, linguistic rules, and religious commitments.\n\n​\n\n\u003e This realist claim that social structures have existed without being conceptualized raises the question: if human beings had different ways of practicing religion since prehistoric times, why and when did people “finally” create the taxon? Almost every scholar involved in the reflexive turn says that religion is a modern invention.\n\n​\n\n\u003e Nevertheless, it is not plausible that modern Europeans were the first to want a generic concept for different ways of interacting with gods. It is easy to imagine that if the way that a people worship their gods permeates their work, art, and politics, and they do not know of alternative ways, then it would not be likely that they would have created a concept for it. There is little need for a generic concept that abstracts a particular aspect of one’s culture as one option out of many until one is in a sustained pluralistic situation. The actions that today are categorized as religious practices—burial rites, the making of offerings, the imitation of divinized ancestors—may have existed for tens of thousands of years without the practitioners experiencing that diversity or caring to name it. Nevertheless, it is likely that a desire to compare the rules by which different people live in relation to their gods would have emerged in many parts of the world long before modernity. One would expect to find people developing such social abstractions as cities and then empires emerged and their cultures came into contact with each other. From this realist perspective, it is no surprise that, according to the detailed and example-filled argument of Barton and Boyarin (2016), the first use of religion as a generic social category, distinct from the concept of politics, for the ways that people interact with gods is not a product of the Renaissance, the Reformation, or modern colonialism at all, but can be found in the writings of Josephus (37–c. 100 CE) and Tertullian (c. 155–c. 220 CE).\n\n​\n\n\u003e From the realist perspective, it is no surprise to see the development of analogous terms in medieval China, centuries before interaction with Europeans (Campany 2003, 2012, 2018) and in medieval Islam (Abbasi 2020, 2021). The emergence of social kinds does not wait on language, and the development of language for social kinds is not only a Western project. If this is right, then the development of a concept for religion as a social genus is at least two thousand years old, though the social reality so labeled would be much older.\n\n# References\n\nSchilbrack, K.

    "content": "\nIn the twentieth century, the concept of religion had a third expansion as it included practices that connect people to inanimate forces that lack minds. William James, for example, proposed that the concept of religion generally means a belief on a non-empirical structure, an \"unseen order,\" where human beings live accordingly. To clarify that what James was referring to does not include human-created structures, Clifford Geertz proposed that such order was fundamental and has existed even before human beings. Because of this expansion, atheistic worldviews characterized by a belief in this unseen order, such as Taoism, Buddhism, Stoicism, and Neo-Confucianism were considered religions.\n\n# References\n\nSchilbrack, K. (2022). The Concept of Religion. In E. N. Zalta (Ed.), _The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_ (Summer 2022). Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University. [https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2022/entries/concept-religion/](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2022/entries/concept-religion/)\n\u003eWere one asked to characterize the life of religion in the broadest and most general terms possible, one might say that it consists of the belief that there is an unseen order, and our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto. (1902 [1985: 51]; cf. Proudfoot 2000)\n\u003e\n\u003eIn the twentieth century, one sees a third and last growth spurt in the extension of the concept. Here the concept religion is enlarged to include not only practices that connect people to one or more spirits, but also practices that connect people to “powers” or “forces” that lack minds, wills, and personalities.\n\u003eBy an “unseen order”, James presumably means a structure that is non-empirical\n\u003e \n\u003e The anthropologist Clifford Geertz addresses this issue, also defining religion in terms of an “order” but specifying that he means practices tied to conceptions of “a general order of existence”, that is, as he also says, something whose existence is “fundamental”, “all-pervading”, or “unconditioned”\n\u003e \n\u003e The practices that are distinctly religious for Geertz are those tied to a culture’s metaphysics or worldview, their conception of “the overall shape of reality” (1973: 104). Like James, then, Geertz would include as religions not only the forms of life based on the theistic and polytheistic (or, more broadly, animist or spiritualist) beliefs that Herbert and Tylor recognized, but also those based on belief in the involuntary, spontaneous, or “natural” operations of the law of karma, the Dao in Daoism, the Principle in Neo-Confucianism, and the Logos in Stoicism. This expansion also includes Theravada Buddhism because dependent co-origination (pratītyasamutpāda) is a conception of the general order of existence and it includes Zen Buddhism because Buddha-nature is said to pervade everything. This third expansion is why non-theistic forms of Buddhism, excluded by the Herbert’s and Tylor’s definitions but today widely considered religions, can serve as “a litmus test” for definitions of the concept",

    "content": "\nLike the [[Five elements of a religion per Herbert]], Tylor used a minimal definition of religion, but simplified it even further. He used a single criteria: a belief in spiritual beings. With such a minimal definition, Tylor was intentionally including human cultures that are discriminated by Christian Europe by advocating that they are also capable of engaging with intellectual and existential questions.\n\n# References\n\nSchilbrack, K. (2022). The Concept of Religion. In E. N. Zalta (Ed.), The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2022). Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University. https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2022/entries/concept-religion/\n\n\u003e Like Herbert, Tylor sought to identify the common denominator of all religions, what Tylor called a “minimal definition” of religion, and he proposed that the key characteristic was “belief in spiritual beings.” This generic definition included the forms of life predicated on belief in a supreme deity that Herbert had classified as religion. But it could also now include—without Herbert’s procrustean assumption that these practices were really directed to one supreme being\n\u003e \n\u003e The use of a unifying concept for such diverse practices is deliberate on Tylor’s part as he sought to undermine assumptions that human cultures poorly understood in Christian Europe\n\u003e \n\u003e This opposition to dividing European and non-European cultures into separate categories underlies Tylor’s insistence that all human beings are equivalent in terms of their intelligence. He argued that so-called “primitive” peoples generate their religious ideas when they wrestle with the same questions that all people do, such as the biological question of what explains life, and they do so with the same cognitive capacities. They may lack microscopes or telescopes, but Tylor claims that they seek to answer these questions in ways that are “rational”, “consistent”, and “logical”. Tylor repeatedly calls the Americans, Africans, and Asians he studies “thinking men” and “philosophers”. Tylor was conscious that the definition he proposed was part of a shift: though it was still common to describe some people as so primitive that they had no religion, Tylor complains that those who speak this way are guilty of “the use of wide words in narrow senses” because they are only willing to describe as religion practices that resemble their own expectations",

    "content": "\nThe word religion is commonly used in ordinary language today to refer to a group of people who engage in a set of social practices. This is actually the most critical change in the history of the concept of religion, which first happened when the word was used as a social genus that included Christian and non-Christian groups as species. A good example of this was Edward Herbert's (1583–1648) writings ([[Five elements of a religion per Herbert]]).\n\nReligion as a social genus was used by European Christians in categorizing the cultures they encountered in their colonial ventures. As an example, see the work of Edward Burnett Tylor (1832–1917) ([[Religion is a belief in spiritual beings per Tylor]]).\n\nThe concept of religion as a social genus evolved to encompass, in order, theistic, polytheistic, then cosmic criterion. The cosmic criterion articulated by William James ([[Religion involves a belief in an unseen order per James]]) is now the most dominant.\n\n# References\n\nSchilbrack, K. (2022).

Given the near-automatic way that Buddhism is taken as a religion today, the cosmic version now seems to be the dominant one.",

    "title": "Rural Philippines and the mystery of inner life",
    "content": "\nThis is my experience, but I have a good hunch that this happens in general in the Philippines. In the provinces, in rural areas, the writing life is but a mystery. If one lives it privately, one will avoid hearing weird impressions from observers. But when one lives it in public—as I sometimes do—one should expect weird impressions.\n\nI don't need to go far to hear it. My mother and father seems to have no clue what on earth am I doing with my life. They don't ask. Perhaps they are afraid of something they don't understand or they are unsure what exactly to ask.\n\nWhenever I visit Pangasinan, I always spend about an hour or more sitting under Tito Eddie's kubo and writing mg morning pages. A few months ago, Tito Danny, who recently returned to live alone in a house he built by himself near Tito Eddie's house, passed by me as I was writing. He said, \"Matalinon talaga yay kaanakan ko,\" and went his way.\n\nI find this weird because when there was nothing intelligent about what I was doing when he passed by. I was just writing a couple of broken sentences that didn't mean a lot. And what if I was just listing something down? I have a feeling that when you are in the province, seeing someone alone, with a pen, and a journal, writing down, this signifies intelligence (unless, of course, you are a notable crazy head).\n\nTito Danny met Papa later that day and he told him the same thing, \"Mataltalino may anak mo. Wadman ed silong na alolong mansusulat.\" But what my father replied was what really convinced me of my thesis that I will later divulge. He said, \"Andi. Mantatrabaho labat iman.\"\n\nTaken in face value, my father was right. I was working. Writing on a journal, pouring my soul. This is work. It is my main job. I do editing (my profession) on the side just so I have money every month so that I could free myself for most of the month and write. But I know my father. He equates everything I do to work as in the work that earns me money. He doesn't have a clue that I can be going outdoors writing on my diary and not be working. \n\nThis total inability to think outside the economic framework of monetary exchange—this is what I find interesting. It is a reflection that the writing life in the Philippines is still elitist and therefore is mysterious to most people in the rural areas. Bookstores are almost nonexistent. Local magazines are non-existent in some provinces like Pangasinan. And even places like Baguio where they exist, only a select few frequent them. I know because I've seen the statistics. Almost no one is reading in the Philippines—particularly among the lower middle and lower classes. If no one reads, thene it is difficult to even be a writer in the Philippines.\n\nBut even the non-writing part of being a writer is weird for some. I am a writer who walks. I use walking to enrich my writing by taking a break from thinking and just being, using the natural world to prompt my thinking and writing. Since I have several walking spots far from home, I usually ride my bike to the start of these trails, get off, and walk with my bike trailing beside me. People find this weird. Some will stop and ask me if I have a flat tire. Some would even go further and ask why—what am I doing, me weird bird.\n\nThe worst experience I had regarding this was with an old 60-year-old man who thought that I was suicidal or drunk. \"You seem to be in deep thought,\" he said. \"Are you okay? You are walking too slowly. Come with me and let's have a drink.\" I politely declined and answered all his questions sharply to show that I wasn't drunk.\n\nThe writing life is a mystery even for writers themselves. But you'll never know how much it is a mystery to other Filipinos until you live in the province and live the writing life in public.\n\n# References\n",

    "title": "Seeing Then Saying",
    "content": "![A tree on the fields](afternoon-on-the-fields.jpg)\n\nThe film [Paterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8pGJBgiiDU) inspired me to write a poem after a long time of not being able to do so. For anyone who hasn’t seen the movie (you should), it is about a poet who writes really good poems but doesn’t want to publish them. It is a great parable for the tension between the artist as the Self and the artist as a performer.\n\nWhat really struck a chord in me was how the poet existed in his everyday life. I felt like he had poetry goggles: everything he saw and experienced was fodder for his art.\n\n## A Way of Seeing\n\nAt about the same time, I listened to an interview with [Alain de Botton](https://philosophybites.com/2007/11/alain-de-botton.html) about his unconventional way of writing philosophy. When asked what he thinks philosophy was, he said that it is a way of seeing things rather than a topical category. What I understood from his perspective was that things don’t become philosophical just because they are concerned with problems like, perhaps, the existence of God or the soul. They become philosophical because we look at them then talk about them in a manner that is philosophical—we ask, we reflect, we extrapolate, we provide arguments, then we make conclusions. Philosophy is about a way of seeing things than a way of saying them.\n\nI think the same can be said about poetry. The hero of Paterson (who, by the way, was a man named Paterson living in a place called Paterson—what poetry!) saw everything as poetic. Then he described what he saw through poetic language. What was amazing about Paterson was that he can’t remove that lens through which he saw things. It was built-in and, therefore, defined every single moment of his existence.\n\n## \"There\" and \"Here\"\n\nMy gut says that there is just a subtle difference between seeing the world in a poet’s lens and seeing it in a philosopher’s lens. It is subtle because I believe, based on my own experience, that both lenses really want to make sense of the world and our relationship with it. Both lenses are existential. The biggest difference between the two is objectivity and subjectivity. While the philosopher desires primarily to see what is really “there”, the poet desires primarily to see what is really “here”. In other words, the philosopher hungers to know about reality. The poet hungers to know about how we experience that reality.\n\nAnd this translates with how the poet and the philosopher “say” things. When I am wearing my philosopher’s lens, I am primarily interested in accuracy. I am careful not to make claims hastily, I use direct language, I am more humble and honest, and I don’t say I am sure about something I am not.\n\nOn the other hand, when I am wearing my poet’s lens, I care more about authenticity than I am about accuracy, I am fine with sacrificing carefulness for genuineness, I use metaphors, and I don’t care about making grand claims about things I am not sure about. It is okay for me to lie if that means I am able to be true to my experience.\n\n## Philosophy and Poetry are Complementary\n\nOf course, it is not impossible to take on both lenses. In fact, they are complementary. In my quest for truth, philosophy is my primary lens. It is more honest and careful. It is more trustworthy. But in transmitting that truth to others, I use the poet’s lens (or perhaps more accurately, the poet’s microphone), because poetry’s strength lies in the way it says the truth. I can still be accurate in my description of truth, I can still be careful, but I can also be freer and more colorful in my description of it. I can be more poetic.\n\nIn both cases, philosophy and poetry cease to be topical categories boxed inside academic departments. They become ways of living—a personal religion if you will. And, in fact, what they really are are simply descriptions of innate capabilities we are born with—two ways of operating that define what makes us human.\n",

  "/Self-directed-learning": {
    "title": "Self-directed learning",
    "content": "\nSelf-directed learning\n\n[Intro]\n\nWhy self-directed learning?\n\n[Content]\n\nPlan your learning\n\nChoose your learning goals\n\nPerhaps the hallmark of self-directed learning is its emphasis on choosing your own goals for a particular learning project. Traditional learning gives that privilege and responsibility to the teacher or whoever designs the curriculum. Setting your own learning goals assures that you are learning purposefully, filtering out information that don’t serve your objectives. It also makes learning and remembering what you learned easier because you are learning out of passion, not obligation.\n\nTo identify your learning goals, simply ask yourself: “What do I want to achieve from this learning experience?” By reflecting on this question, you will come up with a few useful answers. You could ask the question repeatedly until you get to the core reason behind your desire to learn.\n\nFor example, after asking this question a couple of times, I realized that I wanted to research various ways on how one can live more sustainably in the Philippines not because I wanted to write an article or author an entire book about it, but because I simply want to understand how I can personally make the transition into a better way of life. The latter is the main goal, the former is a way to achieve that goal.\n\nIt is also important to remember that the learning goals that you set for yourself at the beginning of a learning project is not cast in stone. Feel free to refine it as your perspective broadens farther in your project.\n\nChoose a learning method\n\nThere is no “one size fits all” method of acquiring knowledge, so it’s important that you identify the best learning method for your specific project. Do you like reading? Would you rather listen to lectures? Will discussing the subject with others help you better understand what you are learning? Should you teach what you learned instead? Could attending workshops, online classes, or in-person classes help you better?\n\nReflect on what learning strategies worked for you in the past, and combine them with other strategies that pick your interest, to create a more fulfilling learning experience.\n\nDecide how to evaluate the results of your learning\n\nBefore starting a self-directed learning project, it can be very helpful to determine how you will evaluate your learning experience. Evaluating your learning helps you achieve two important things: first, it tells you how much and how well you really learned and second, it gives you something to share to others – a practice that would even give you more feedback on your learning.\n\nWhat’s unique in evaluating self-directed learning projects is that you get to choose the method that is best for you. There are two main ways on evaluating a self-directed learning project.\n\nFocus on the process. All self-directed learning projects are already products of their own. The feelings, the realizations, the insights that come from “doing” the learning project are already benchmarks that determine the effectiveness of the methods applied.\n\nFocus on a product. While all self-directed learning projects can be evaluated from the intangibles they create while they are pursued, putting a tangible output at the center of a learning project can enhance the learning experience. A tangible product or a project-driven strategy could provide you with something to show people what you have accomplished. This is very useful in getting valuable feedback from the perspective of other people and in building a portfolio of work that you can use to build your credentials.\n\nCreate an initial plan\n\nWriting down your learning goals, your learning method of choice, and your evaluation strategy on paper might be everything you need to you create a structure for your self-directed learning project. There are books that teach you how to create a more detailed learning plan that resemble a curriculum, but keeping this process as simple as possible at the start could help you focus more on the learning itself. That said, you might want to read Chapter 10 of Ronald Gross’ book Peak Learning to pick up some light strategies on planning your learning projects. His discussion of things you could do before learning (Chapter 6) also looks really helpful. I’ll share one or two of his strategies in a future post.\n\nIn Gross’ other book The Independent Scholar’s Handbook, I found a planning process that can be applied to self-directed learning projects, especially those with a more academic or research leaning. In Chapter 2, Gross shared the process of creating a “pre-plan.” What I love about the “pre-plan” is its simplicity and scalability. You can use a pre-plan alone to guide your self-directed learning project or scale it up into a more thorough plan which you can then use as a proposal to possible funding sources.\n\nHere’s how to create a “pre-plan.”\n\nWrite one to two sentences to describe your idea.\n\nExpand your idea by writing a one page write up about it. Include a few supporting thoughts.\n\nAllow the idea to percolate in your mind. While doing so, get some feedback.\n\nNow that you have some useful ideas from the feedback you got, create a pre-plan by writing one paragraph for each of these:\n\nBackground\n\nProblem or question\n\nObjectives\n\nPlan\n\nOutcome\n\nResources needed\n\nHow to present\n\nHow to get feedback on the results\n\nPeople interested in the results\n\nHow to reach people\n\nCondense your idea and plan into one paragraph. You may use this paragraph to circulate your idea to interested people who might be able to provide you with additional feedback.\n\nLook for the best and most appropriate resources\n\nDecide the range of resources to look for\n\nLook for resources\n\nEvaluate resources\n\nChoose the best resources\n\nWhile you are learning\n\nNote-taking\n\nRetention\n\nEvaluate your learning\n\nArticle\n\nBook\n\nShare and get feedback\n\nBlog\n\nBest Books on Self-directed Learning\n\nPeak Learning\n\nDon’t Go Back to School\n\nThe Independent Scholar’s Handbook \n\n# References\n\nYoung, S.

And then, we opt for a cheaper insurance plan, which means in the rare event taht something worse will happen, we use our pocket money or emergency fund plus the insurance instead of the insurance alone. One day, our assets will be enough to compensate for rare medical events.\n\nIf you rely more on others, you will be less reliant on your ability to lessen the risk.

    "title": "7 Lessons I Learned Since My Depression In 2011",
    "content": "\n![Vince Imbat in a kubo at the beach](vince_imbat_kubo_beach.jpg)\n\nMost of my friends know about it. If you've been reading my blog for some time there's a big chance you know about it. I have written about it in the past and will continue to do so.\n\nI was diagnosed with Major Depression in March 2011, a few weeks before the end of my third year in college. I will miss a year of college because I was put on psychiatric medications and had to recuperate from all the stress.\n\nIt was the single biggest event that changed my life (so far). I was 19 then. I am 26 now. And this year, about a month after I turned 26 (February 9), I celebrated seven years of coming out of depression. Yes, celebrate. Because no matter how terrible the experience was, I always see it as the beginning of my transformation. I grew older, wiser, more mature after the experience.\n\nToday, I want to share with you 7 lessons I learned (and continue to learn) since my depressive episode in 2011.\n\n## 1\\. Personal resolve—more than anything else—will save your life.\n\nHere's a quote that stuck to me for a long time, from Dr. David D. Burns' popular book _Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy_:\n\n\u003e ...the crucial decision to _try to help yourself_ is the key that will allow you to feel better as soon as possible, regardless of how severe your mood disturbance might seem to be.\"\n\n## 2\\. You shouldn’t blame anyone for your misfortune. Be totally responsible for your own life.\n\nAfter getting help in 2011 and when the sleeping pills started to kick in, I gained enough energy to start blaming other people about what happened to me. My parents became the number one culprit.\n\nI'm old enough to realize that I was greatly mistaken. I was totally responsible for what happened to me. And I am totally responsible for making it all right. The people around me are only there to support me. And even if they contributed to the suffering, they too suffered. We are all victims of forces beyond our control and the best way forward is to tackle the problem head-on, together.\n\n## 3\\. Remember: It is not just you who is suffering. The people around you are also suffering.\n\nIt is difficult to see this at first. Depression has an unbelievable way of sucking you into a vortex where what only mattered was you, you, and you.\n\nA few years after my episode, I chanced upon a notebook by accident. It contained notes my mother wrote to herself during the darkest days of my depression. While I was suffering, she was also suffering, and I didn't see this before. I see it now.\n\n## 4\\. Learn to look at depression as a friend rather than an enemy.\n\nWith all the pain it brings anyone, it is only natural to see depression in a dark, bitter light. Time heals everything and time brings perspective.\n\nHere's a quote by Thomas Moore from his contribution to the anthology _Sacred Sorrows: Embracing and Transforming Depression_. His chapter was aptly titled \"Gifts of Depression: Healing the Wounded Soul.\"\n\n\u003e Depression grants the gift of experience not as a literal fact but as an attitude toward yourself. You get a sense of having lived through something, of being older and wiser. You know that life is suffering, and that knowledge makes a difference. You can't enjoy the bouncy, carefree innocence of youth any longer, a realization that entails both sadness because of the loss, and pleasure in a new feeling of self-acceptance and self-knowledge.\"\n\n## 5\\. Always try to be in the present moment and live one day at a time.\n\nI don't know of any other lesson I learned since my depression which was as useful, practical, and life-transforming as this one. The major reason why I had depression, in the first place, was that I took on a lot of stress from going after goals that run five years, six years, in the future. I thought that the \"going after\" and the \"future\" will give me joy. Well, turns out, I'm wrong.\n\nToday, it's difficult for me to set goals for more than one or two years. And it's even more difficult for me to track whether or not I'm getting \"there.\" Most of the time, I'm just here, in this day, this moment. It feels like I'm not getting anywhere most of the time. But it also feels more calm, blissful, genuine.\n\n## 6\\. Life is all about people.\n\nDepression taught me a lot about people. I don't know everything and I'm still a work in progress in terms of my relationships. But I can't live without the people in my life. I seek intimate conversations and genuine bonding with friends and family more than anything else.\n\n## 7\\. Depression may be a call to slow down—stay small, make life simple, and do what makes you feel good.\n\nMy choice for a simpler life is a direct corollary of my experience with depression. I understand that some people have a zest for the adrenaline that comes from going after really big and adventurous goals. But that's not me and I'm already okay with that.\n\nDepression was telling me something and I've opened myself up to listen to it.\n\nIn his book _Let Your Life Speak: Listening to the Voice of Vocation_, the Quaker author and activist Parker Palmer admitted that he too suffered from depression. Palmer talked about an instance when his therapist suggested that he look at depression, not as an enemy, but as a friend who is pressing him to the ground.\n\nPalmer's reaction to this suggestion was, at first, mixed:\n\n\u003e Amid the assaults I was suffering, the suggestion that depression was my friend seemed impossibly romantic, even insulting. But something in me knew that down, down to the ground, was the direction of wholeness, thus allowing that image to begin its slow work of healing in me.\n\u003e\n\u003e I started to understand that I had been living an ungrounded life, living at an altitude that was inherently unsafe. The problem with living at high altitude is simple: when we slip, as we always do, we have a long, long way to fall, and the landing may well kill us. The grace of being pressed down to the ground is also simple: when we slip and fall, it is usually not fatal, and we can get back up.\n\nLater, Palmer became convinced that depression was teaching him something important:\n\n\u003e Depression was, indeed, the hand of a friend trying to press me down to ground on which it was safe to stand—the ground of my own truth, my own nature, with its complex mix of limits and gifts, liabilities and assets, darkness and light.\n\nDepression is something that shouldn't be experienced by most people. It's painful and going through it entails a lot of loss and despair. Nevertheless, it is part of being human and even if you do not go through it, it is inevitable that you are going to learn its lessons through a different experience.\n\nFor those who are going through depression and those who will go through it, rest assured that there is a way out of the pain and suffering. But there is no escaping the lessons. They will be here to stay with you forever. And you will be grateful for them.\n",

If the healthiest motivation for working is internal rewards, why pursue something that feels external? (See [[Why does one opt to live in public?]] for my thoughts on this).\n\n# What to share\n\nBecause I also see my work as a form of [[thoughts/use-inspired basic research]], I would be sharing:\n\n1. Theories - What I learned from studying and reflecting\n2. Methods - What I learned from applying what I studied and reflected on\n\nThere are two ways I can share my theories and methods:\n\n1. [[Sharing the product]]\n2. [[Sharing the process]] (i.e. [[thoughts/work with the garage door up]])\n\nMy main art is still non-fiction prose writing. I want to write about my studies and the application of my studies in the context of my personal story and in a way that makes fine reading (see [[thoughts/i write personal essays]]). But I could perhaps also write plain direct philosophical artifacts and use them to write the more creative ones. For sure, I need to do a lot of thinking about my [[thoughts/writing]] and how I share it. Good thing I can learn from [[People who inspire my sharing]].\n\n# How to share\n\nSharing is the larger context from which the motivation to learn different artistic media lies. I want to share my ideas, thoughts, and feelings better, so I learn writing, photography, and coding.\n\n[[My strategy for sharing]]\n\n# Related\n- [[Sharing gone wrong]]\n- [[Cautious sharing process]]\n\n# References\n\n",

Any feedback I get from this could develop the individual concepts, which will be included into bigger artifacts that will then follow the previous process for sharing.\n\nSharing the process also involves being as honest as possible about my work. I should use [[Anti-marketing]] to build a more authentic relationship with my audience and community.\n\nI need to share my process because my work requires me to answer the queston “[[thoughts/how should I live?]]” It is only natural for my audience to ask what the good life looks like. Using my own life as an example, documenting it, and sharing it to others could help advance my goal.\n\nI need to insert a very obvious element of autobiography in my essays. I shouldn’t just be talking about ideas (like [James Clear](craftdocs://open?blockId=A0914B11-A194-472A-9116-E349DEA7B254\u0026spaceId=63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8)). I need to talk about my life and what I am doing. I need to provide an insider’s perspective to my life in general. I need to share processes and provide updates about where I am going.\n\nIdeas on how to do this and what to share are in the following notes:\n\n- [[thoughts/work with the garage door up]]\n- [[A list of process artifacts I could share]]\n\n",

This might be an unusual statement to say, but in the level of philosophical analysis, unusual arguments against common sense abound. Some people deny that there is an outside world. Technically, these people are called solipsists. They believe that nothing exists other than themselves. It is only their mind which truly exists. What seems like an outside world is only a reality constructed by their mind. They are alone in the deepest meaning of that word.\n\nRelated\n- [[Idealism]]\n\n# References",

    "content": "\nImagine a venn diagram. The first circle (A) is a set of important work that has to be done. The second circle (B) is a set of lucrative and profitable work. The two circles combine to create an intersecting circle (C), which are important work that are also lucrative and profitable.\n\nWe are usually advised to choose as our career the sweetspot that combines A and B. This is taught even in cultural frameworks like the ikigai. But what these frameworks are missing is that there are creative kinds of work that are important and have to be done but are not lucrative or even slightly profitable because there is no market for them or the market is not enough. Their value just does not exist but it doesn't mean that their value will not come in the future or that they have 0 value. As long as the maker sees them as valuable, they have to be done.\n\nSee for example, Van Gogh who valued his work despite no one believing in him. He pursued his work even if it wasn't lucative, ushering a new era of art decades after his death. If he didn't respond to the call of the gift economy, there will be no such art form today.\n\nThe business mindset that lies in the exchange economy will say that if an action or activity does not have an audience to it or does not pay, it has to be abandoned automatically. What I propose is that we don't hasten abandoning projects that came to us as a gift from the universe just because there is no market for them. If our soul is shouting and crying for us to do the thing, we have to do it no matter what.\n\nNot all work must require monetary payment before it happens. If this is the case, there are lots of important work that won't be finished. An example is saving a dying lannguage like Pangasinan. There is no money in this endeavor, but it has to be done.\n\nWe need to intentionally create a space for two or three things that we do without pay.\n\nThe most difficult thing about being an artist is constantly convincing others that what you are doing is important.\n\n# References",

    "title": "Square One: The Foundations of Knowledge (Book Summary)",
    "content": "\nIn _Square One_, Steve Patterson argues that the three laws of logic—the law of identity, the law of non-contradiction, and the law of the excluded middle—demonstrate that absolute, certain, and objective truths exist. He shows how all arguments against the absoluteness of these laws ultimately fail. Patterson believes that all apparent paradoxes or contradictions are simply linguistic errors. Given their nature, Patterson posits that the laws of logic should be the foundation of any accurate worldview.\n\n## Chapter One: Foundations\n\n**Chapter Summary: \"Certain truths exist and they should be used as the foundation for any accurate worldview.\"**\n\n### The Roots of a Tree\n\nFoundations determine the accuracy of a worldview.\n\n### The Foundation of a House\n\nIt is difficult to change the most fundamental ideas of a worldview.\n\n### Rotten Wood\n\nUse skepticism to critically examine and revise your worldview.\n\n### Skepticism\n\nChallenge and doubt every idea you encounter but be open to the possibility that certain truths might exist.\n\n### From Top to Bottom\n\nUse “Why?” to get from premises to foundations, where “Why?” no longer applies.\n\n## Chapter Two: Implausible and Impossible\n\n**Chapter Summary: \"The central argument for implausibility claims that certainty is beyond the reach of humans.\"**\n\n### Two Types of Argument\n\nThere are two kinds of arguments against certain truths: implausibility (humans can’t access certain truths) and impossibility (certain truth can’t be accessed in principle).\n\n### Mistaken Humility\n\nInsisting that all knowledge is uncertain is itself dogmatic.\n\n### No Land Across the Sea\n\nPeople who argue that we will never know if certain truths exist have not ventured far enough.\n\n### Faith In Something\n\nA worldview can be rational down to its foundations; faith is unnecessary.\n\n### The Evolved Brain\n\nThe implausibility of accessing certain truths because of the human brain’s limitation does not rule out the possibility that certain truths exist.\n\n### A Senseless Universe\n\nIf we can make sense of some parts of the universe, then the universe is comprehensible.\n\n### Language Is Imprecise\n\nCommunication might be imprecise, but the understanding of concepts can be precise.\n\n### Sense-Perception\n\nWe can have knowledge that is true regardless of sensory input.\n\n## Chapter Three: Logic and Existence\n\n**Chapter Summary: “The central argument for implausibility fails because the existence of certain truths can be demonstrated easily.\"**\n\n### Increasing Confidence\n\nTo understand certain truths, it helps to first analyze the less-than-certain ideas.\n\n### Logic\n\nLogic is the rules of existence: logic is inseparable from existence.\n\n### Existence\n\nThere are two kinds of existents: one dependent on our conception (ideas) and another independent of it (things).\n\n### Identity\n\nExistents follow the law of identity: \"A is A.\"\n\n### Non-contradiction\n\nExistents follow the law of non-contradiction: “It is not the case that A and not-A.”\n\n### Inseparability\n\nLogic and existence are inseparable: existence cannot occur without identity and non-contradiction.\n\n### True or False\n\nExistence is inseparable from logic, and logic is inseparable from truth and falsehood.\n\n### Negation\n\nThe law of non-contradiction preserves the meaning of “negation,” which in turn, creates “mutually exclusive” things.\n\n### Inescapability\n\nThe laws of logic are necessary, universal, and inescapable. Doubting them is proof that they are correct.\n\n### The Law of the Excluded Middle\n\nClaims about things either correspond to reality or they do not. There is no third option.\n\n### Metaphysics\n\nLogic is the self-identity of everything even if things are different.\n\n### Non-necessary Certainty\n\nThere are certain truths that can be known without logical necessity (ie, awareness).\n\n## Chapter Four: Implication and Application\n\n**Chapter Summary: “Tools are available to create logical structures in our minds (theories) that correspond with the logical structure of the world.\"**\n\n### Conceptual Reasoning\n\nTheories are constructed out of concepts, which are referenced with words within a language. Conceptual reasoning is unpacking the meaning and implication of our concepts to ensure that they are not contradictory.\n\n### Presuppositional Analysis\n\nAnalyzing the implicit concepts bundled with an idea.\n\n### Theory Versus Data\n\nTheoretical critiques are more powerful than empirical ones because a theory is inescapably prior to interpretation of data.\n\n### Deduction and Validity\n\nDeduction is a technique for conceptual reasoning where you try to demonstrate that conclusions of an argument necessarily follow from the premises; those that do are “valid arguments” while those that don’t are “invalid arguments.\"\n\n### Propositional Logic\n\nPropositional logic breaks down the structure of complex arguments into their individual components and uses “rules of inference” to analyze the logical relationship between propositions. Sound arguments are those with true premises and are valid in structure.\n\n### Axiomatic-Deductive\n\nUsing axioms (self-evidently true statements) in deductive reasoning could create logically airtight theories about the world.\n\n### Certainty and the Mind\n\nThe mind is simultaneously able to state subjective truths and objective truths.\n\n### Logic Games\n\nLogic can be used to construct systems (i.e. chess).\n\n### Poker in Your Mind\n\nRationalism, which ensures internal consistency, should be coupled with the real-world feedback advocated by empiricism to create external consistency.\n\n### Hierarchy of Knowledge\n\nThe existence of foundational truth implies the existence of a hierarchy of knowledge because some ideas are presupposed by others.\n\n### Mathematics\n\nMathematics is simply an extension of logic. Therefore, the conclusions are necessary.\n\n### Paradoxes and Puzzles\n\nThere are no actual paradoxes because the Universe could not contradict itself. Apparent paradoxes involve conceptual or linguistic errors that could be resolved through logical analysis.\n\n## Chapter Five: Objections and Paradoxes\n\n**Chapter Summary: “The central argument for impossibility, which claims that logic could not be universal because contradictions exist, is flawed because apparent contradictions are simply linguistic errors.\"**\n\n### The Liar’s Paradox\n\nThe liar’s paradox is not a meaningful proposition; it is a linguistic error.\n\n### The Bittersweet Paradox\n\nThe bittersweet paradox is inconsistent because the meanings of “opposite” and “mutually exclusive” that it adopts are imprecise.\n\n### The Logic of Nothing\n\nNothing is the concept of universal negation. Nothing is a concept without a referent, it is not an actual existent thing, therefore we shouldn’t talk about \"nothing\" as if it is \"something.\"\n\n### Vagueness\n\nThe argument that reality isn’t so binary and therefore logic couldn’t accurately represent it is flawed. A proposition cannot meaningfully be “half true” therefore something cannot be half-existent. Language could be ambiguous but the world cannot.\n\n### Universal Flux\n\nThe argument that the law of identity does not apply to anything because everything is constantly changing is flawed. Constant change presupposes identity because before something could change it has to have an “identity” where it started. Even if a \"thing\" constantly changes, it is in a particular way at a particular time; this still corresponds to the law of identity.\n\n### Eastern Mysticism\n\nMystical experiences do not prove that real paradoxes exist. The apparent contradiction between reality and the mystic's description of her experience is a reflection of the limitations of language and not of logic. Some knowledge is ineffable. Therefore, grant the importance of mystical experiences but recognize that language might not be able to communicate them precisely.\n\n### Quantum Physics\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is used to prove the existence of contradictions, is flawed and there are far more superior alternatives.\n\n### The Unknown World\n\nThe argument that we cannot know if the world operates in a fundamentally logical way because we haven’t experienced everything about it, is flawed. Even if all our conceptions about physics are wrong, the world would still be bound by the law of identity (it is what it is).\n\n### That’s Just Your Logic\n\nThe argument that people can have different logic is flawed because the laws of logic are not agreed to.\n\n### Mere Tautologies\n\nThe argument that the laws of logic are mere tautologies—unnecessary propositions that do not teach us anything new about the world—is flawed. Tautologies are self-evidently true and therefore should be the foundations of any accurate worldview and any scientific exploration.\n\n### The Ultimate Resolution\n\nContradictions cannot exist in the world because of logic. Logic is the ultimate foundation of all forms of knowledge.\n",

Thus, the most important notes in my system go up a ladder to evolve into permanent notes. However, to maintain organization, several notes that don't go up this ladder are also necessary. I divide my taxonomy of notes between notes that go up the ladder and those that don’t.\n\n## Ladder\n\n- Entries in my [[Diary]]. [[A diary should be used as an inbox]] where a single diary entry could be a source of several [[Fleeting notes]].\n- [[Fleeting notes]] (i.e., prompts and incomplete notes) in my [[writing inbox]]. These notes accumulate over time but are drained through a [[Spaced repetition writing system]]. Well-developed fleeting notes leave the writing inbox as [[Evergreens]].\n- [[Evergreens]]. While these notes leave the writing inbox in better quality, they can still be developed further. There are different kinds of permanent notes:\n   - Stubs that don’t have a content of their own but gain meaning through backlinks. An example of this is the note [[Unfruitful]]. I actually gave a short description of the stub, but its meaning makes more sense because of the backlinks under it. It is a place to hold unfruitful writing prompts in my writing inbox that needs to be reviewed in a later date.\n   - Simple definitions for other people’s terms of art\n      - Under this category are also bridge notes, which are meant to connect the relationship between my own terms of art and the terminology of others ([[Create your own terms of art]]; [[Use bridge notes to connect your terms of art with existing ones]]).\n   - Notes with precise declarative or imperative phrases with strong claims, e.g., [[Use a note-writing system]]. If I have no strong claim, I frame these notes as questions, e.g. [[thoughts/i want my audience to feel existential]] These atomic notes are the cream of the crop.\n   - Higher-level permanent notes\n      - Notes that abstract from multiple notes\n      - My own terms of art, e.g. [[Talahardin]]\n- [[Outline notes]], e.g., [[Zettelkasten]]\n\n## Non-ladder\n\n- Proper noun notes. These notes are not concept-oriented so they cannot be used to build permanent notes.\n   - [[literature notes]]. These notes are where I collect fleeting notes from what I read. After I convert these fleeting notes into permanent notes ([[how to convert literature notes to permanent notes]]) thus emptying them, they serve as nodes for backlinks to permanent notes. Literature notes are like outline notes of other people's ideas. For example: [[_notes/02 Talahardin/How to Take Smart Notes - Ahrens]]\n   - [[Person notes]] (e.g., [[contacts/rem tanauan]]) or entity notes.\n   - Log notes. These notes contain ephemeral observations about a specific practice, system, or project over time. Unlike the [[Diary]], which is sliced by date, log notes are sliced by a topic of interest, e.g., [[Nature journal]].\n\nTODO\n\n- Write a note for each note type.\n- Determine if you need to create your own terms of art for each note type.\n- Information in [[Three types of notes in Zettelkasten]] might be redundant.

  "/Tenderness-Shares-a-Root-With-Attention-by-Juliana-Castro": {
    "title": "Tenderness Shares a Root With Attention by Juliana Castro",
    "content": "\nThe expression for taking care in Italian is *prendere cura*; *Curar*, in Spanish, means to cure. To care *is* to cure. Both verbs come from the Latin *cura*: to care, to tend, to heal. Accurate, curator, and secure also share such roots.\n\nThe Latin *tendere*—to stretch, to tense—provides the root for the ways we say that we care, that we try, and that we are soft and easily injured. It’s the origin word for ‘tenderness,’ ‘intent,’ and ‘attention.’\n\nIn English, attention is something you pay. In Spanish, it is something you lend, and in German, something you gift. You “do” attention in Italian and French. Does our relationship with attention change depending on whether we *do* attention_,_ or *gift* it, or _lend_it? In day to day language, paying attention is often interchangeable with taking care.\n\nThe quest for attention is an invitation to care. These parallel expressions are similar in other languages. Words recognize that attention—as a gift, a loan, or payment—is a form of care.\n\nour experience of the world changes language just as languages change our perception of the world\n\nSince the late 14th Century, *tendere* has transformed into a word to define the devotion of our time and concentration. The word “attention” was rare in English before the 1700s and in the mid-1700s meant “consideration, observant care” and “civility, courtesy.” A bit over a century later it was defined as “power of mental concentration.” Before landing on the action verb ‘pay,’ the word attention was used with a variety of familiar verbs: gather, attract, call, and draw. Merriam Webster’s current first definition of attention is as wide as it is poetic: “the act or state of applying the mind to something.” Can there be a more careful act than that of applying the mind to something?\n\nWe were a species without a word for “attention” for hundreds of years. We created it relatively recently, and have since shaped it. Time enhances the magic of the vernacular. Historically, attention has been a courtesy. Something you offer as a gift, as a caring act. But today, it’s a commodity, an asset distributed to the highest bidder in our daily lives. Ensnared in the cycle of having our attention hijacked, we’re losing the agency of the *offer.*\n\nIn its familiar sense, Phillips writes, attention-seeking “is a way of wanting something without knowing what it is. A social ability, an appeal to others to help us with our wanting.” To be and make others comfortable with our attention-seeking, we transform it into art, or success, or likable public snippets of our lives. If we were to take these gestures in the literal sense, maybe all we’re trying to communicate is that we want to be cared for.\n\nIn *How to Do Nothing*, Jenny Odell argues that given the contemporary politics of attention, to actively choose who or what to hear or see “forms the ground not only for love, but for ethics.” As people and corporations discuss and capitalize on the monetization of our attention, I want to reclaim attention as an act of care. Maybe, if we borrow from other languages and treat attention as a gift or an action—rather than a payment or a loan—we might be able to better communicate what we need and care for what others offer. Besides, at the heart of the word is its legacy: to tend to someone or something.\n\n## References\n\nCastro, J. (2021, June 15). Tenderness Shares A Root With Attention. _Are.Na_.

    "title": "The Art of Navigating Disagreements",
    "content": "\nWe disagree because we don't have direct access to the minds of others. I think that's where disagreements ultimately originate. The only way we could have direct access to someone else's mind is when we are that person.\n\nThis is why we are able to say something like, \"It's difficult for me to explain to you because you didn't go through what I went through.\"  \nAnd this is exactly right. Our experiences are unique to us—to our perspective and to the time and space where our experiences happen.\n\nEven if someone else went through a _similar_ experience, that experience is entirely unique on its own—it is never the same—because events happened in a different body and in a different time. Those make experiences unique. No single experience ever happens again.\n\nWe can't escape the following conclusion: each of us is unique in this fundamental way. No one else can have our thoughts and experiences.  \nWe can never _transfer_ these unique thoughts and experiences, we are only able to _communicate_ them through the tools of language—sounds, words, and their meanings.\n\nWe cannot directly transfer our thoughts, our reasonings, and our experiences. What we are able to do is to piece together different tools of language—most of which arise from convention—and trust that the person we are talking to creates a mental picture that is an approximation of what we are trying to say. We do not have absolute control of this process. The other person may or may not understand, and if we are trying to make an argument about something, the other person may completely disagree. This is just the fact of life and we will be in a better position if we accept this and not be bothered a lot when communication fails. We can only do so much.\n\nI am someone who has lots of ideas about the world, and I have friends who are the same. But we read different books, we follow different people, and we were raised in different ways. When I have deep conversations about the world with them, we reach a lot of points when I fail to understand what they are trying to say or I disagree on their point of view completely. This happens both ways, and there were times when I felt like an agreement will never be reached. This happens more often than I wish, but for me, it is a testament to the uniqueness of each and everyone—something I sincerely believe.\n\nSuch scenarios do not just happen in intellectual conversations. They happen within the family and out there in public life. When a family member refuses to talk for fear that her perspective would be misunderstood or when politicians bicker at each other in national TV, this fact of life is in full display.\n\nI find that there are two attitudes in addressing situations of disagreements:\n\n1. We could attack and hate the person behind the conflicting opinion or\n2. We accept the disagreement and continue to coexist—and even care about—the other person.\n\nWhen I saw Walden Bello go at it with a representative of Anakbayan in live national TV, which was followed by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUn4MHlxU4w), I saw two people representing two sides who chose to act according to the first attitude I mentioned. When I learned about how an activist gifted a [hand-made](http://craftivism.com/) handkerchief to a politician from the other side of an issue, in order to start a conversation with her, I saw the second attitude.\n\nI don't want to label either of the two approaches as either _good_ or _bad_. I want to objectively judge which of the two approaches give us the result that we are looking for.\n\nFor me, in a world where disagreements happen more than agreements, I think cultivating peaceful, nonviolent coexistence with those who disagree with us is ultimately a more effective strategy of living. It accepts that disagreement is a fact of life and goes with it rather than use force to change what is unchangeable.\n\nUltimately, putting ourselves intentionally in situations where we come face-to-face with disagreements—with people who think differently—make us a better person. Engaging in difficult conversations make us aware of three important things:\n\n1. How it _feels_ like to be in such situations,\n2. How we are inclined to react to such situations, and\n3. The weaknesses and loopholes in our own thinking, way of communicating, and overall attitude in navigating differences.\n\nBeing aware of these three things within the context of a face-to-face disagreement with another person is great training.\n\n1. When I confront my emotions during disagreements, I become accustomed to them.\n2. Seeing my initial reaction to disagreement informs whether I tend to attack someone or listen with the intention of peaceful coexistence.\n3. Noticing the loopholes in my own thinking encourages me to research more, thus getting closer to what is true.\n\nNo. You don't have to agree with another person's point of view. In fact, you should never agree to someone if you know what he is telling isn't true. But you don't have to go to a verbal or, worse, physical tussle with that person.\n\nPeaceful coexistence is possible. It always is.\n",

In a way most of our global culture which is of course heavily influenced by former colonizers\n\nOne question: how did indigenous peoples respond to science, technology progress?\n\nPart of the narrative should be a critic of science and technology brought to the islands thanks to colonialism\n\nIn your critic, include a critic of the information age which relegated physical labor and material production to marginalized societies.\n\nWere there early critics of tech among illustrados? Or were all of them thinking about progress? Seeing tech as the future of nation-building?\n\nMy narrative can simply be\n\n- Facts\n- Then my interpretation (based on theories that reflect my values)\n\nExpensive Spiritual Practices\n\nExpensive spiritual practices imply that spirituality or enlightenment is only for the material rich. The material rich are usually those who are not involved in physical labor in material production.\n\nSome would argue, through an entrepreneurial mindset, that expensive spiritual practices would limit entry so that experiences are limited to a few people, thus more intimate and successful. But I wonder why we need to use money as a barrier. Limiting participants can easily be done without using money. For example, organizers could create a list of everyone who expressed interest. Perhaps based on a first come first served basis, or better through an application process which could determine who really needs the spiritual practice the most, the organizers can come up with a list of the first participants. Those who wont make it for the first run will be invited next time.\n\nRemoving money while still limiting participants would mean that everyone could try the practice in the future, when the few participants are done, not when they are finally materially capable of doing so.\n\nAn expensive spiritual practice also assumes that poor people are so busy living pay day to pay day anyways that they wont bother being spiritual people. They havent transcended their material needs in a Maslow Heorarchical fashion if you will so they are “lesser” beings.\n\nThis attitude is connected to Charles Eisenstein’s analysis of mankind’s ascent - his belief that he can transcend materiality (read nature). This aspiration is reflected in mankind’s pursuit of technological utopia but also of his pursuit to achieve full spiritual actualization, where the material world is completely forsaken.\n\nBut why do we always have to treat the material world as evil? And give primacy to spiritual longings? When our ancestors never created this distinction. For them, gods and therefore the sacred resided in the trees, in the animals, in the food they ate and in the process of producing those food.\n\nBy using money as a barrier of entry to spirituality, we reinforce this flawed dichotomy, this illusion of the separation of spirit and matter, of rich and poor, of spirituality and survival. We give primacy to those who can easily make money and accumulate, able to save 65,000 to attend a 10 day retreat or 100,000 to become a yoga teacher. Most of the time, these people take on jobs that are out of touch from material production.\n\nThe best spiritual practices are pure and sacred because they are transmitted in a pure and sacred way, through a spirit of giving.\n\nExamples\n\nVipassana\n\nIme’s Santosha\n\nVoluntary contributions\n\nWhen something is given freely even if it doest have the looks of being spiritual, it automatically takes on a more sacred aura\n\n\\#evernote\n\n",

    "title": "The Challenges of Building a New Culture and Community of Poets",
    "content": "\n![Community Silhouette](community-silhouette.jpg)\n\nAbout a week ago, my good friend Rem Tanauan, a great poet himself whose work has profoundly influenced my own creative life, sent me [this article](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/482/the-art-of-poetry-no-83-billy-collins) that features an interview with Billy Collins, dubbed “the most popular poet in America”.\n\nRem and I are fans of his poems because they are conversational, witty, humorous, and down-to-earth. These are the kind of poems we want to see more of and some of our poems were definitely influenced by Billy Collin’s voice.\n\nRem asked me to share with him my thoughts on the article. What resulted was a brain dump of my ideas on building a new culture and community of poets in the Philippines.\n\nI thought I would share them with you today. Poetry is the most freeing art form I know and discovering it had a profound effect on my mental health and quality of life. It is a great complement to the equally important work I do in philosophy.\n\nIn this post, I’ll be sharing my thoughts on several quotes from the article.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n## You Are the Ultimate Judge of Your Work\n\nI’ll start with this quote from the article:\n\n\u003e I say, Get rid of it. Because if it got into a later poem it would be Scotch-taped on. It would not be part of the organic, you know, chi, the spine that the poem has, the way it all should be one continuous movement. Poems that lack that seem very mechanically put together, like a piece here and a part there.\n\nThe context of this quote is that Billy Collins is advocating that poems be written in one sitting. He writes them in 20-40 minutes and only returns to them after a few weeks to do some minor edits. According to him, writing poems in one sitting creates a more organic poem that has “one continuous movement”. This, he said, is more desirable than poems that are “mechanically put together.\"\n\nWhile I sympathize with his advice, and I do write poems in one sitting, I have some reservations for what he said here partly because I do blackout poetry and by their nature blackout poems are scotch-taped poems. Their mechanical nature is what makes them different. The reason why I like them is that I don’t have to stress a lot about being original when I do them. I might experience some stress when looking for patterns between words, but at least I am taking a rest from the stress of trying to be original all the time.\n\nOf course, it isn’t impossible for a blackout poem to suddenly emerge like a typical poem, which has the characteristic of having \"one continuous movement\" (what he describes here as “chi\"). However, what if a poem doesn’t have this? Is it a bad poem? Was my process for coming up with it a wrong way of doing poetry even if I enjoyed doing the process?\n\nThese questions led me to think about how we actually judge a poem. We can criticize a poem by not having this element of chi but isn’t our criticism of that poem subjective, based on our biases and tastes? Heck, aren’t all our judgments of art subjective?\n\nOne reason why I think this is an important question to answer is that I actually believe (and I share this with Rem and most of our poet friends) that poetry, or any other art for that matter, should ONLY be done with the purpose of enriching our quality of lives, not to diminish joy or the feeling of “ginhawa” (a Filipino concept of integral well-being, which I’ll loosely translate here into “bliss\") that is inherent in all creative pursuits. Now, what if a poet wrote a mechanical poem but did so “blissfully\"? Do we say that his work is not good just because it was mechanical? Whose standards are we using to judge the work?\n\nThis made me think that, perhaps, by describing how writing poetry happens, we are actually prescribing a “right way” to write poetry. If so, how different would we be from formalists who have tried to proselytize “one way” of doing poetry?\n\nUltimately, I asked myself, “If blissful writing is the organizing principle, who is the ultimate judge of a poet’s work?\n\nThe way I see it, there are only two judges:\n\n1. The poet himself\n2. Other people (other poets who believe in writing blissfully, other poets who don’t share the value of blissful writing, and general readers)\n\nI thought about how this judgment process happens and constructed the following table:\n\n![Judging a poem](Judging-a-poem.png)\n\nFrom this meditation, I realized that the ultimate judge of any poem is the poet him/herself. The reason for this is that any definition of success is always subjective first before it is objective. Any group can impose particular standards of what a good poem is that its members can agree on. But these standards are not necessarily the standards of an individual. So even if feedbacks are helpful, even if objective standards have their use in communities, a poet or an artist needs to trust his own standards first so he can trust his own abilities.\n\nAny community of poets who would claim to be an alternative to business-as-usual should embrace this attitude. Though feedback is very much needed from fellow poets and the general audience, these should not replace the most important judge or feedback-giver of all: oneself. This is because if a poet does not learn how to trust himself, he won’t be able to produce any work. And according to Billy Collins, from the same article, the most important thing is that a poet writes.\n\n\u003e Actually, I don’t think you can be really badly influenced by anyone, as long as it makes you write.\n\n## \"Did You Feel Good While Writing?\"\n\nThis brings me to my next meditation. As a thought experiment, imagine that a highly intellectual and conceptual formalist poet wanted to join the alternative community of blissful poets. She said she wanted to join because she liked the group’s emphasis on feeling joy throughout the creative process. By leaving the dog-eat-dog culture behind, she hopes to experience a different relationship with her writing. She immediately experiences what she is looking for because there are no strong standards or harsh judgments in the group.\n\nHowever, here’s the problem: She still writes highly intellectual, highly formal, and highly conceptual poems that are not blissful for readers. When this was brought to her attention, she said this is the only way she knows how to write. This is the writing that makes her feel good. What will be the right response in this situation? Will the community of blissful poets banish her for failing to write more intuitive and down-to-earth poems? If this is the response that the community gives, is it still true to its principle of blissful creativity? Is it still facilitative, or is it already prescriptive?\n\nFor me, the answer is clear. For a poetry group to truly exemplify the principle of “ginhawa”, it should be a space where there are fewer and fewer constraints. To quote the Tao Te Ching here:\n\n\u003e The more restrictions and prohibitions there are,\n\u003e\n\u003e The poorer the people will be.\n\nLesser rules mean that there is more space for ALL kinds of poetry. Even the super formalist poems should be welcomed. Experimental poems should be welcomed (like blackouts). Intellectual poems should not be looked down on. This means that the alternative community of blissful poets becomes a space of true freedom. It does not prescribe strongly on anything. If there is any prescription, an organizing principle that binds everything, it is only this:\n\n“Did you feel good while writing? Ok. That’s it.”\n\nIf you add on that, then you add constraints that could muddle the very essence of what “feeling good” is. The subjective blissful experience of an individual poet should be the ultimate principle.\n\n## Freedom in Poetry\n\nThe role of freedom in poetry was nicely said by Collins in this quote in the article:\n\n\u003e I grew by allowing aspects of myself that I had previously excluded into the poetry. I think all poets—younger poets particularly—have a private sense of decorum, meaning they feel there are certain things they should write about and other things they shouldn’t.\n\nMy dream is for poetry to be freeing, and if a community should be a space for free poetry, it needs to evolve into that place where poets are free to explore the different parts of themselves, where no topic is out of the conversation and no form is out of experimentation. Of course, there are intricacies of this and we shouldn’t expect any community of poets to immediately be like this. But it’s a nice dream.\n\nI also think that this should be one of the main goals of any critique of traditional poetry. To be truly an alternative way, alternative poetry has to be freeing. It should, as much as possible, prevent creating rules on what should be and what shouldn’t be explored. It would be nice to see that each poet of such a group is exploring their own topics and their own structures and there should be a venue for them in the community to show their work. They should be given the time to share during gatherings or they should be given a platform where they can share their discoveries. They should be given a voice and there shouldn’t be censorship at all.\n\n## A Solo Act\n\nAll of these ties well with the general subject of the tension between an individual’s need for community and his need for authenticity. Here is an interesting quote from the article that jumps into this:\n\n\u003e For me poetry was always a solo act. A romantic idea maybe, but I thought that poetry was something you did in solitude, and the idea of sharing your work with anybody was completely antithetical to what I thought poetry was all about.\n\nI think the challenge for any community of blissful poets is how it can be a place where camaraderie does not muddle with the solitude that poetry requires. How can poets be \"alone together\"? How can the community be a space where an individual’s need for community and the need for authenticity is both fulfilled?\n\n## Keep Your Center\n\nIn ending, I think I want to highlight again this tension between the poet as the Self and the poet as a member of a group. In the article, Billy Collins sees this tension:\n\n\u003e The image one has to present as a performer, as an interviewee and whatnot, is a very different self from the sensibility that actually creates the poems. You need to keep your center, the part that writes the poems, and not spin off into popularity.\n\nI have been meditating on this for a very long time. Every time I show up to the world, a part of me is lost. This is expected. But what I wish to have is a community, a space where the potential damages of sharing my work with others are lessened or minimized, a sort of creative insurance.\n\nBuilding a new culture and community of poets in the Philippines who believe that creativity does not have to always be competitive and harsh is hard. Any such endeavor needs to prioritize the maintenance of a safe space where every individual member is an asset. What I shared above are my thoughts on how this might be done.\n\nMy friend Rem plans to reopen his poetry course and community of blissful poets, “Tungko ng Tula”, by January 2021. If you want to discover a different kind of poetry or just curious about anything I shared in this article, I encourage you to visit Rem’s IG page [@ditomuna](https://www.instagram.com/ditomuna/). Read his beautiful _tanaga_ poems (four lines, seven syllables) and while you’re at it, send him a message.\n\nThe course and community also have a website at [tungkongtula.com](https://tungkongtula.com/), which is currently only written in Filipino.\n",

Eric Hoffer is called the \"longshoreman philosopher\" because he writes philosophy during breaks when he isn't lifting heavy boxes to make a living as a longshoreman (a person employed in a port to load and unload ships). Despite not being schooled, Eric's mind was sharp and his thinking was recognized by many authors during his time.\n\nHe has this to say about intellectuals:\n\n\u003e What the intellectual craves in his innermost being is to turn the whole globe into a classroom and the world's population into a class of docile pupils hanging onto the words of the chosen teacher.\n\nHe defined an intellectual as:\n\n\u003e one who saw himself as born to teach, lead and command\n\nand\n\n\u003e a literate person who feels himself a member of … an intellectual elite.\n\nOn his book _The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements_, Hoffer famously said:\n\n\u003e Scratch an intellectual, and you find a would-be aristocrat who loathes the sight, the sound and the smell of common folk.\n\nWhat Hoffer did was philosophy. But he didn't have to be an intellectual—an academic, someone with a degree—to do philosophy. Philosophy was as accessible as the air he breathe. At its essence, philosophy is simply \"engaging with knowledge.\" You _know_ something by means of your bodily functions. You engage with the knowledge in whatever means—sometimes you use it as a form of consolation, sometimes as a form of entertainment, inspiration, or practical know-how. The motivations to engage with knowledge can vary but it is what it is_—engaging with knowledge_.\n\nNow, intellectuals see philosophy differently. They can't be satisfied with seeing philosophy as something as simple as this. Rather, they see it as a sacred relic in need of protection. And to protect it, they divided it into individual disciplines, expanded each, and appointed guardians to these disciplines. But they weren't satisfied. They caged the disciplines into the institutions of universities, created expensive programs that people could only access by paying, and appointed _experts_ to lead these programs.\n\nIf someone comes along wanting to _engage with knowledge_ but chooses to do so outside these caged programs, he is looked down upon by these _experts_. Even if he produces good work, he won't be recognized for it. Instead, he will be judged based on whether or not he has a Ph.D. If he doesn't, he is not a \"professional philosopher.\" If he is not recognized by his _peers_, he is a quack.\n\nEric Hoffer was an outlier and working with knowledge has become a tribal ritual and a competitive sport.\n\nThe \"professional philosopher,\" having lived inside the cage for so long will brand any work happening outside the academe as subpar, mediocre, hoax, and \"not philosophy.\"\n\nAn ordinary fisherman is unlettered, uneducated, and incapable of doing philosophy. To even think that he could _engage with knowledge_ is ludicrous. To call him a philosopher is blasphemy.\n\nAnd yet, knowledge is so powerful a force to be confined within the stalwart walls of academia. The more you protect knowledge—by hiding it inside jargon—the more it leaks out. When knowledge leaks out, it becomes potent and lethal. Put it on the hands of the wrong people and you've started a wildfire.\n\nWhy can't we work from a place of truth that knowledge is more democratic than intellectuals assume? Knowledge permeates in the crevices of the societal stonewall. It creeps inside the heads of the unlettered, the disabled, the poor, the inarticulate, the ordinary folk.\n\nI refuse to use the word philosophy in such a narrow sense—because it has been very clear to me that what we do when we are philosophizing is not at all narrow. To call oneself a \"professional philosopher\" is to not understand one's discipline.\n\nYou can cage medicine, nursing, engineering, or computer science into disciplines—but never philosophy. It's a vibrant animated force that escapes every attempt to capture it.\n\nProbably, the most accurate description of how we should think of philosophy was captured by Thoreau in his journal entry dated December 15, 1859:\n\n\u003e Philosophy is a Greek word by good rights, and it stands almost for a Greek thing. Yet some rumor of it has reached the commonest mind. M. Miles, who came to collect his wood bill today, said, when I objected to the small size of his wood, that it was necessary to split wood fine in order to cure it well, that he had found that wood that was more than four inches in diameter would not dry, and moreover a good deal depended on the manner in which it was corded up in the woods. He piled his high and tightly. If this were not well done the stakes would spread and the wood lie loosely, and so the rain and snow find their way into it. And he added, \"I have handled a good deal of wood, and I think that I understand the _philosophy_ of it.\n",

    "content": "\nYesterday, I had a very beautiful walk. I biked the same route I walked the other day (the night before). It was past 5 pm, still some sunlight but no longer as bright. The road was filled with vehicles. But I know the dirt road will be empty. It always is. I first noticed an ant hill—or was it a termite hill? I took a photo of it while two teenagers rode their bikes passed my back. I don't think they have biked this dirt road before as they returned immediately to the main road after just a few seconds.\n\nI then noticed some irrigation machine and paraphernalia, which are gallons and plastic bottles of different sizes. I think these containers used to hold the fuel that ran the machine. But why leave it here rather than bring it home so you have somewhere to put your fuel next time? I struggled to take a photo, moving closer to the machine and gallon then moving farther to include the alolong. I saw mounds of calamansi.\n\nAlas, I moved on and now saw a fresh green bed of what was perhaps rice seedlings. They were neatly arranged, all eight rows of them. I rested my eyes on the green color for a while. Around here is where I realized that these dirt roads, these abodes of silence, are the organic materials that draw me into walking. They are my kissas. If I am looking for what feels natural then they are it. I am drawn towards the silence they bring, the transcendental experience of being in them, the surprises from the natural world, and the thinking and reflection I get from being alone in them.\n\nThis made me realize that the mentors I want to learn from are the Thoreauvian writers—writers who walk for self-mastery, to understand how to live well. So Thoreau, Dillard, the Japanese Thoreau, and the philosophers who walked (perhaps even Thich Nhat Hanh). My process would be fieldworks in the afternoon and writing, reading, and thinking in the morning. The gamble is that this interplay between thought and experience in a way that is uniquely me, will make it easier to integrate and be well with all the other areas of my life.\n\nSince I was a child, I already knew about this—my purpose was to be with myself most of the time, to listen to this beautiful mind, to put myself in environments that make it a lot easier to thrive in my mind. This has always been who I am. I do not have to be who I am not. I do not have to write about what others are writing about. I commit to being in love with my mind and my life and my experience—not because I think they are special but because I think they bring me joy.\n\nI saw a large mound, a dig. Are they building a house at the middle of the field? Is there treasure? I walked further and saw a kuliglig wagon and shot it with perfect focus. I reached the last leg of the trail, but the grass was too thick at the end so I stopped where the grass was too lengthy, in front of an open alolong with the farmer's clothes and pillows and sat on the side of the pilapil. It was 6:45. I sat there for 15 minutes. Then I went home.",

One of them was [[Dave Ursillo]]. His writing really resonated to me and did something I didn't expect. He woke up my “spiritual” side.\n\nBecause Dave was a yogi and he shared some of his favorite books about yoga, I got acquainted first with [[Hinduism]]. With his suggestion, I read the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], and [[The Heart of Yoga]] by Desikachar). I also met the works on [[Spiritual humanism]] by [[Jay Lakhani]]. Even at this point, I was still trying to connect secular knowledge with religious wisdom.\n\nThrough Dave’s suggestion, I also encountered and read the [[Tao Te Ching]].\n\nI also started reading [[New Age]] philosophy.\n\nI also started reading contemporary spiritual teachers like [[Eckhart Tolle]].\n\nI devoured [[Nonduality]], [[Advaita Vedanta]], read [[Jeff Foster]]. I never really understood the teachings logically but I really felt good, felt like I found something in me that was always there. I saw that I don't have to be a radical and angry atheist like [[Richard Dawkins]] or the people at the [[Philippine Atheism, Agnosticism, and Secularism Incorporated (PATAS)]] to be truthful. I can be truthful and compassionate. I can have truth and beauty.\n\nI tried doing meditation but still struggled. I was finally able to build a yoga plus meditation routine. I felt inner changes. I became less angry.\n\nMy exposure to Eastern thought made me a believer of [[Nonviolence]]. Not that I ever believed in violence. But I was given a logical reinforcement of what I know deep inside was true for me by a tradition that goes ages.\n\nA natural extension of nonviolence is nonviolence on non-human beings. Thus my exposure to [[Economics]] and [[Environmentalism]].\n\nTo do\n\n- This note is too long. First, go even more extensive in the events. Then, divide the note into smaller notes. For example, a note about what happened before Dave Ursillo, during Dave, then after Dave, then my exploration of Environmentalism.\n\n# References\n",

    "title": "The First 20 Hours — Kaufman",
    "content": "\n**Chapter 1**\n\n- [[Acquire a skill or knowledge rapidly by being specific, prioritizing the most relevant parts, and deliberately practicing]]\n- [[Acquire just enough learning to deliberately practice and self-correct]]\n- [[Practice is necessary in acquiring skill and knowledge]]\n- [[Credentialing can hurt rapid skill acquisition]]\n- [[Three-stage model of skill acquisition]]\n\n**Chapter 2**\n\n**You learn something rapidly if you are curious enough about it**\n[[Use curiosity to guide your thinking]]\n\n\u003eI find it useful to think of these principles as ways to cultivate a “temporary obsession.” Rapid skill acquisition happens naturally when you become so curious and interested in something that other concerns fall away, at least temporarily.\n\n**Ten major principles of skill acquisition**\n\nKaufman is a bit redundant. You can integrate these principles into the steps (?)\n\n\u003eThink of these principles as ways to identify a skill worthy of temporary obsession, focus on it, and remove distractions or barriers that distract you from effective practice. Here are the ten major principles of rapid skill acquisition:\n\u003e\n\u003e1. Choose a lovable project.\n\u003e2. Focus your energy on one skill at a time.\n\u003e3. Define your target performance level.\n\u003e4. Deconstruct the skill into subskills.\n\u003e5. Obtain critical tools.\n\u003e6. Eliminate barriers to practice.\n\u003e7. Make dedicated time for practice.\n\u003e8. Create fast feedback loops.\n\u003e9. Practice by the clock in short bursts.\n\u003e10. Emphasize quantity and speed.\n\n**Choose a lovable project.**\n\n“The best thing that can happen to a human being is to find a problem, to fall in love with that problem, and to live trying to solve that problem, unless another problem even more lovable appears.”\n\nRapid skill acquisition requires choosing a lovable problem or project. The more excited you are about the skill you want to acquire, the more quickly you’ll acquire it.\n\nIn practice, finding a lovable project is a very individual matter.\n\nIf you focus on acquiring your prime skill (that is, your most lovable project) before anything else, you’ll acquire it in far less time.\n\n**Focus your energy on one skill at a time.**\n\nacquiring new skills requires a critical mass of concentrated time and focused attention. If you only have an hour or two each day to devote to practice and learning, and you spread that time and energy across twenty different skills, no individual skill is going to receive enough time and energy to generate noticeable improvement.\n\nWhen I try to learn everything at once, however, I don’t really learn anything. Instead of making progress, I spend too much time switching between different skills, getting frustrated, and moving on to something else. That’s a recipe for extremely slow skill acquisition.\n\nPick one, and only one, new skill you wish to acquire. Put all of your spare focus and energy into acquiring that skill, and place other skills on temporary hold.\n\n**Define your target performance level.**\n\nA target performance level is a simple sentence that defines what “good enough” looks like. How well would you like to be able to perform the skill you’re acquiring?\n\nYour target performance level is a brief statement of what your desired level of skill looks like. Think of it as a single sentence description of what you’re trying to achieve, and what you’ll be able to do when you’re done. The more specific your target performance level is, the better.\n\nDefining your target performance level helps you imagine what it looks like to perform in a certain way. Once you determine exactly how good you want or need to be, it’s easier to figure out how to get there.\n\nHow you define your target performance level depends on why you chose to acquire the skill in the first place.\n\nOnce you reach your initial target performance level, you can always choose to keep going if you wish. The best target performance levels seem just out of reach, not out of the realm of possibility.\n\nAs a rule, the more relaxed your target performance level, the more rapidly you can acquire the associated skill.\n\n**Deconstruct the skill into subskills.**\n\nMost of the things we think of as skills are actually bundles of smaller subskills. Once you’ve identified a skill to focus on, the next step is to deconstruct it—to break it down into the smallest possible parts.\n\nOnce the skill is deconstructed sufficiently, it’s much easier to identify which subskills appear to be most important. By focusing on the critical subskills first, you’ll make more progress with less effort.\n\nDeconstructing a skill also makes it easier to avoid feeling overwhelmed. You don’t have to practice all parts of a skill at the same time. Instead, it’s more effective to focus on the subskills that promise the most dramatic overall returns.\n\nDeconstructing the skill before you begin also allows you to identify the parts of the skill that aren’t important for beginning practitioners. By eliminating the noncritical subskills or techniques early in the process, you’ll be able to invest more of your time and energy mastering the critical subskills first.\n\n**Obtain critical tools.**\n\nMost skills have prerequisites to practice and performance.\n\nWhat tools, components, and environments do you need to have access to before you can practice efficiently? How can you obtain the very best tools you can find and afford?\n\nTaking a moment to identify critical tools before you start practicing saves precious time. By ensuring you have the resources you need before you begin, you maximize your practice time.\n\n**Eliminate barriers to practice.**\n\n**Significant prepractice effort.** Such as misplacing your tools, not acquiring the correct tools before practicing, or skipping setup requirements.\n\n**Intermittent resource availability.** Such as using borrowed equipment or relying on a resource that has limited operating hours.\n\n**Environmental distractions.** Such as television, ringing phones, and incoming e-mail.\n\n**Emotional blocks.** Such as fear, doubt, and embarrassment.\n\nEvery single one of these elements makes it harder to start practicing, and therefore decreases your acquisition speed.\n\nRelying on willpower to consistently overcome these barriers is a losing strategy. We only have so much willpower at our disposal each day, and it’s best to use that willpower wisely.\n\nThe best way to invest willpower in support of skill acquisition is to use it to remove these soft barriers to practice. By rearranging your environment to make it as easy as possible to start practicing, you’ll acquire the skill in far less time.\n\n**Make dedicated time for practice.**\n\nIf you rely on finding time to do something, it will never be done. If you want to find time, you must make time.\n\nYou have 24 hours to invest each day: 1,440 minutes, no more or less. You will never have more time. If you sleep approximately 8 hours a day, you have 16 hours at your disposal. Some of those hours will be used to take care of yourself and your loved ones. Others will be used for work.\n\nWhatever you have left over is the time you have for skill acquisition. If you want to improve your skills as quickly as possible, the larger the dedicated blocks of time you can set aside, the better.\n\nThe best approach to making time for skill acquisition is to identify low-value uses of time, then choose to eliminate them. As an experiment, I recommend keeping a simple log of how you spend your time for a few days. All you need is a notebook.\n\nThe results of this time log will surprise you: if you make a few tough choices to cut low-value uses of time, you’ll have much more time for skill acquisition. The more time you have to devote each day, the less total time it will take to acquire new skills. I recommend making time for at least ninety minutes of practice each day by cutting low-value activities as much as possible.\n\nI also recommend precommitting to completing at least twenty hours of practice. Once you start, you must keep practicing until you hit the twenty-hour mark. If you get stuck, keep pushing: you can’t stop until you reach your target performance level or invest twenty hours. If you’re not willing to invest at least twenty hours up front, choose another skill to acquire.\n\nThe reason for this is simple: the early parts of the skill acquisition process usually feel harder than they really are. You’re often confused, and you’ll run into unexpected problems and barriers. Instead of giving up when you experience the slightest difficulty, precommitting to twenty hours makes it easier to persist.\n\nThink of this approach as an exercise in grit: you’re not going to let some silly little issue stop you from doing what you’ve decided you really want to do. You’ll either solve the problem, or do your best until you reach the twenty-hour mark. At that point, you’ll be in a better position to decide how to proceed.\n\n**Create fast feedback loops.**\n\n“Fast feedback” means getting accurate information about how well you’re performing as quickly as possible. The longer it takes to get accurate feedback, the longer it will take to acquire the skill.\n\nFast feedback naturally leads to rapid skill acquisition. If feedback arrives immediately, or with a very short delay, it’s much easier to connect that information to your actions and make the appropriate adjustments.\n\nThe best forms of feedback are near instantaneous.\n\nCoaches aren’t the only source of fast feedback. Capture devices, like video cameras, can help you watch yourself as you perform. Tools like computer programs, training aides, and other devices can immediately indicate when you make a mistake or something is amiss.\n\nThe more sources of fast feedback you integrate into your practice, the faster you’ll acquire the skill.\n\n**Practice by the clock in short bursts.**\n\nThe solution for this is to practice by the clock. Buy a decent countdown timer3 and set it for twenty minutes. There’s only one rule: once you start the timer, you must practice until it goes off. No exceptions. This simple technique will make it easier to complete longer periods of sustained practice, even when you get tired or frustrated.\n\nThe more periods of sustained practice you complete, the faster your skill acquisition. Set aside time for three to five practice sessions a day, and you’ll see major progress in a very short period.\n\n**Emphasize quantity and speed.**\n\nWhen you begin to acquire a new skill, it’s tempting to focus on practicing perfectly—a recipe for frustration. Your performance, of course, won’t be anywhere close to perfection.\n\nInstead of trying to be perfect, focus on practicing as much as you can as quickly as you can, while maintaining “good enough” form.\n\nSkill is the result of deliberate, consistent practice, and in early-stage practice, quantity and speed trump absolute quality. The faster and more often you practice, the more rapidly you’ll acquire the skill.\n\nThat’s not to say that you should ignore good form while practicing. Some skills, particularly skills that require physical actions or motions, require a certain quality of form to perform well.\n\nTechnique matters.\n\nFirst, ensure you’re practicing using form that’s good enough to satisfy your target performance level. Once you’re practicing in good form at least 80 to 90 percent of the time, crank up the speed for faster skill acquisition.\n\n**So Does It Work?**\n\nWhen you start, you’re horrible, but you improve very quickly as you learn the most important parts of the skill. After reaching a certain level of skill very quickly, your rate of improvement declines, and subsequent improvement becomes much slower.\n\nThe trick is to start practicing as quickly as possible. Not thinking about practicing or worrying about practicing, but actually practicing.\n\nThe more time and energy you spend moving through the first two phases of the skill acquisition process and the less time you spend doing things that don’t help you, the more quickly you’ll acquire the skill.\n\n**What About Immersion?**\n\nThe downside of immersion is that it usually requires making the skill your primary focus for an extended period of time.\n\nUnfortunately, most of us have commitments we can’t (or don’t want to) walk away from: family, work, mortgage payments, et cetera. In these cases, immersion can be difficult or impossible.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the idea of immersion becomes an active barrier: if you keep waiting for an immersion opportunity before committing to acquiring a new skill, you can waste years of valuable time.\n\nTake the immersion opportunities as they come, but don’t count on them. These techniques are designed to help you acquire new skills even if you only have an hour or two to spare each day.\n\n**Well Begun Is Half Done**\n\nYou won’t need to use every one of these principles for every skill you acquire, but you’ll always find at least a handful of them essential.\n\nI find it’s useful to think of these principles as a checklist. Whenever you decide to learn something new, just go though the checklist and decide which principles apply to your particular project.\n\n**Chapter 3**\n\nDoing a bit of research before you jump into practice can save you precious time, energy, and emotional fortitude.\n\nLearning makes your practice more efficient, which lets you spend more of your practice time working on the most important subskills first.\n\n1. Research the skill and related topics.\n2. Jump in over your head.\n3. Identify mental models and mental hooks.\n4. Imagine the opposite of what you want.\n5. Talk to practitioners to set expectations.\n6. Eliminate distractions in your environment.\n7. Use spaced repetition and reinforcement for memorization.\n8. Create scaffolds and checklists.\n9. Make and test predictions.\n10. Honor your biology.\n\n**Research the skill and related topics.**\n\nSpend twenty minutes searching the web, browsing a bookstore, or scanning the stacks at your local library for books and resources related to the skill. The goal is to identify at least three books, instructional DVDs, courses, or other resources that appear to be connected to the skill you’re trying to acquire.\n\nThe intent of this early research is to identify the most important subskills, critical components, and required tools for practice as quickly as possible. The more you know in advance about the skill, the more intelligently you can prepare. The goal is to collect a wide body of knowledge about the skill as quickly as possible, creating an accurate overview of what the skill acquisition process will look like.\n\nFor rapid skill acquisition, skimming is better than deep reading. By noticing ideas and tools that come up over and over again in different texts, you can trust the accuracy of the patterns you notice and prepare your practice accordingly\n\nInstead of reinventing the process, you’ll find existing techniques that have been perfected over many years by the masters of the field. If you see the same technique or process described in multiple resources, chances are good it’s important to know.\n\nOnce you’ve found what appear to be the most useful techniques, you can experiment with them\n\n**Jump in over your head**\n\nEarly research is one of the best ways to identify critical subskills and ideas, but it’s also very likely you won’t know what they mean yet. The meaning comes later, once you’ve started practicing.\n\ncomprehensible input. By default, the new information you’re consuming isn’t very comprehensible, since it’s not connected to anything you know or have experienced.\n\nOver time, the same information will become comprehensible once you have some experience under your belt.\n\nNoticing you’re confused is valuable. Recognizing confusion can help you define exactly what you’re confused about, which helps you figure out what you’ll need to research or do next to resolve that confusion.\n\nIf you’re not confused by at least half of your early research, you’re not learning as quickly as you’re capable of learning. If you start to feel intimidated or hesitant about the pace you’re attempting, you’re on the right track. Provided you’re working on a lovable problem or project, the more confused you are at the outset, the more internal pressure you’ll feel to figure things out, and the faster you’ll learn.\n\nNot being willing to jump in over your head is the single biggest emotional barrier to rapid skill acquisition. Feeling stupid isn’t fun, but reminding yourself that you will understand with practice will help you move from confusion to clarity as quickly as possible.\n\n**Identify mental models and mental hooks.**\n\nAs you conduct your research, you’ll naturally begin to notice patterns: ideas and techniques that come up over and over again.\n\nThese concepts are called mental models, and they’re very important. Mental models are the most basic unit of learning: a way of understanding and labeling an object or relationship that exists in the world. As you collect accurate mental models, it becomes easier to anticipate what will happen when you take a specific action. Mental models also make it much easier to discuss your experiences with others.\n\nYou’ll also notice a few things that look like something you’re already familiar with. These are mental hooks: analogies and metaphors you can use to remember new concepts.\n\nThe more mental models and mental hooks you can identify in your early research, the easier it will be to use them while you’re practicing.\n\n**Imagine the opposite of what you want.**\n\nA counterintuitive way to gain insight into a new skill is to contemplate disaster, not perfection.\n\nWhat if you did everything wrong? What if you got the worst possible outcome?\n\nThis is a problem-solving technique called inversion, and it’s helpful in learning the essentials of almost anything. By studying the opposite of what you want, you can identify important elements that aren’t immediately obvious.\n\n**Talk to practitioners to set expectations.**\n\nEarly learning helps you set appropriate expectations: What does reasonable performance for a beginner actually look like?\n\nWhen you jump into acquiring a new skill, it’s very common to underestimate the complexity of the task, or the number of elements involved that are required to perform well. If the skill involves the possibility of social prestige, the associated mystique can also cloud early expectations.\n\nTalking to people who have acquired the skill before you will help dispel myths and misconceptions before you invest your time and energy. By knowing what you can expect to see as you progress, you’ll find it much easier to sustain your interest in practice, and avoid becoming discouraged early in the process.\n\n**Eliminate distractions in your environment.**\n\nDistractions are enemy number one of rapid skill acquisition. Distractions kill focused practice, and lack of focused practice leads to slow (or nonexistent) skill acquisition. You can preempt this by taking a few minutes to anticipate and eliminate (or reduce) as many distractions as possible before you start practicing.\n\nThe most significant sources of distraction come in two forms: electronic and biological.”\n\nYour television, phone, and Internet are electronic distractions. Turn them off, unplug them, block them, or otherwise remove them from your environment while you’re practicing unless they’re absolutely necessary for the practice itself.\n\nThe fewer distractions you have while practicing, the more quickly you’ll acquire the skill.\n\n**Use spaced repetition and reinforcement for memorization.**\n\nHere’s the catch: your memory isn’t perfect. Whenever you learn something new, you’ll probably forget it unless you review the concept within a certain period of time. This repetition reinforces the idea, and helps your brain consolidate it into long-term memory.\n\nResearchers have found that memory follows a decay curve: new concepts need to be reinforced regularly, but the longer you’ve known a concept, the less regularly you need to review it to maintain accurate recall.\n\nSpaced repetition and reinforcement is a memorization technique that helps you systematically review important concepts and information on a regular basis. Ideas that are difficult to remember are reviewed often, while easier and older concepts are reviewed less often.\n\nBy creating flash cards as you’re deconstructing the skill, you’re killing two birds with one stone.\n\nOnce you’ve created your flash cards, it only takes a few minutes each day to review them. By systematizing the review process and tracking recall, these systems can help you learn new ideas, techniques, and processes in record time. If you review the decks consistently, you’ll memorize necessary concepts and ideas extremely quickly.\n\nIt’s important to note that skill acquisition is usually much more involved than academic learning.\n\nThe best use of this technique is in instances where fast recall of information is essential. If you’re learning common vocabulary words in order to acquire a new language, spaced repetition and reinforcement is valuable. In instances where fast recall isn’t crucial, you’re usually better off skipping the flash cards in favor of maximizing practice and experimentation time.\n\n**Create scaffolds and checklists.**\n\nCreating a simple system is the best way to ensure these important elements happen with as little additional effort as possible.\n\nChecklists are handy for remembering things that must be done every time you practice. They’re a way to systematize the process, which frees your attention to focus on more important matters.\n\nScaffolds are structures that ensure you approach the skill the same way every time.\n\nCreating scaffolds and checklists makes your practice more efficient. They also make your practice easier to visualize, which helps you take advantage of mental rehearsal, which can help with some forms of physical practice.\n\n**Make and test predictions.**\n\nBased on what you know, can you guess how a change or experiment will turn out before you do it?\n\nGetting into the habit of making and testing predictions will help you acquire skills more rapidly. It’s a variation on the scientific method, with four key elements:\n\n- Observations—what are you currently observing\n- Knowns—what do you know about the topic already?\n- Hypotheses—what do you think will improve your performance?\n- Tests—what are you going to try next?\n\nI recommend using a notebook or other reference tool to track your experiments and form hypotheses as you practice. By keeping track of your predictions and generating new ideas, you’ll have more fruitful experiments to test.\n\n**Honor your biology.**\n\nthe optimal learning cycle appears to be approximately ninety minutes of focused concentration. Any more, and your mind and body will naturally need a break. Use that opportunity to exercise, rest, have a meal or snack, take a nap, or do something else.\n\nThis principle dovetails very nicely with practicing by the clock. By setting your timer for sixty to ninety minutes before you start practicing or researching, it will be easier to remember to take a break when you’re done.\n\nYou can also split your practice into several smaller parts, with a short break in the middle if needed: twenty minutes of practice, ten-minute break, twenty minutes of practice, ten-minute break, et cetera.\n\n**Stacking the Deck**\n\nYou won’t need to use all of these principles for every skill you acquire, but you’ll always find at least a few of them essential.\n\nI find it’s useful to think of these principles as a secondary checklist. Whenever you decide to acquire a new skill, just review this checklist and decide which principles apply to your project.\n\n**Putting Theory into Practice**\n\nI have no experience with any of these skills. Using the techniques and methods I just described, my goal is to acquire each of them in thirty days or less. My estimated time of acquiring each of these skills is approximately twenty hours, averaging sixty to ninety minutes of practice each day.\n\n**Afterword**\n\n**Practice an hour a day for one month until you reach the 20-hour mark.**\n\n\u003ePrecommit to practicing that skill for an hour or so a day for the next month. Once you actually start practicing, you’ll always pick it up more quickly than you expect. Break it down, make the time, try new things, and your brain will begin picking up the technique automatically: that’s what brains do. When you get stuck or confused, test a new approach.\n\u003e\n\u003eRemember: once you start, you can’t stop until you reach your target performance level or the twenty-hour mark. Struggle if you must, but don’t stop. Show your grit, and keep pushing forward. You’ll get there: all it takes is practice.\n\n# References\n\nKaufman, J.

    "title": "The Free Agent Ecosystem",
    "content": "\nAs attractive and compelling as it is to be a full-stack freelancer, there are three significant downsides that can’t be addressed without collaboration:\n\n-   It is very solitary, even lonely work\n-   It is difficult to find mentors and peers to learn from and to learn from you\n-   You have to not only do the work itself, you have to market and sell it\n\nFree Agent Ecosystem (FAE), a framework that describes a “sustainable, commercial ecosystem among collaborating professional services free agents.”\n\nFree agents often don’t know how to structure deals with each other, making it difficult for them to take on projects that are too large and complex for an individual to handle alone. They also fear losing control of the customer relationship that is their lifeblood, and potentially not being compensated for their intellectual property. Not to mention legal and tax liabilities involved in hiring and paying others to deliver services.\n\nFAE proposes that an effective framework for effectively building coalitions of free agents must include three things:\n\n1.  An understanding of the “value chain” of professional services transactions\n2.  A way to deliberately cultivate the relationships and behavior of the ecosystem members\n3.  Agreement templates to structure service delivery and intellectual property transactions\n\nThese three components provide mechanisms and incentives for collaborating on all parts of project delivery. It allows small groups of decentralized free agents to serve more and larger clients without the overhead of large consulting firms. It offers a “relationship infrastructure” to bring just the right talent to each project – no more and no less.\n\n#1 – The Value Chain\n\nThe “value chain” for professional services includes a series of stages through which a project moves, with value added at each step along the way. The Prime Contractor (PC or Prime) is the primary person responsible for the project, and hires subcontractors to perform certain functions.\n\nWith the trends mentioned above, these stages are increasingly being completed by different people and even companies. FAE identifies the following four stages in its model:\n\nLead generation (5%)\n\nThe first stage is the generation of qualified leads, which is separated out from the next step of closing the sale. It basically serves as a referral fee.\n\nThis arrangement allows some free agents to specialize more in generating leads, while others specialize in delivering the main service. It permeates the ecosystem with an open-ended reward for everyone to remain vigilant for sales opportunities, not only for themselves, but for anyone they might refer a client to.\n\nSales and contract administration (30%)\n\nThe second stage includes closing the sale, through administering the execution of the contract. It serves as an affiliate fee, separating the sales activity from service delivery. The same person could potentially complete the first two stages, earning a 35% share of the contract.\n\nBy raising or lowering this percentage, the Prime Contractor can signal how much they are willing to “pay” to not have to handle sales. The PC could even set the rate to favor certain kinds of projects or clients over others.\n\nDelivery of Services (60%)\n\nThe actual delivery of the main service is allocated a 60% share, reflecting the fact that the activities before and after are together almost as valuable as the service itself. This fixed percentage allows the Prime Contractor to know more accurately how much they have to work with, and to pass along those clearer expectations to subcontractors.\n\nCustomer follow-up (5%)\n\nThe fourth and last stage is to wrap up the project, including quality assurance, customer service, collecting feedback and ideas for improvement, and up-selling or cross-selling the client on other projects.\n\nThis final stage is often overlooked or minimized, but is crucial to customer satisfaction. This share provides an incentive to extend current contracts, or ask for referrals to other clients. The final 5% for customer follow-up could lead directly to a 5% share for the next lead, representing an “investment” by the current project into the next one.\n\nThese percentages are not fixed, but can increase or decrease depending on the needs of a given value chain. They can be thought of as mid-points in a negotiable range. Their purpose is to ensure that the value attributed to each stage feels equitable, neither underappreciated nor overcompensated, regardless of which role a person plays in a given project.\n\nFAE’s 7 simple rules are:\n\n1.  Reward sales behavior\n2.  Honor the Prime, the Sub, and the Client\n3.  Honor your own identity (whether you are the Prime or the Sub)\n4.  Reveal the network to the client\n5.  Manage and share your knowledge (client and transactional info)\n6.  Show up and add value\n7.  Do the right thing – choose win-win-win outcomes\n\nReward sales behavior\n\nThe referral fee is only paid if the contract is signed somewhere down the line, so the incentive is for the referrer to position the Prime Contractor in the most positive light possible.\n\n“No amount of money will buy this from any marketing consultant or ad agency over the long haul.” The referral fee is thus low enough to discourage bad faith referrals, yet high enough to reward behavior that might happen in the course of existing relationships.\n\nHonor the Prime, the Sub, and the Client\n\nA common problem, the authors note, is that free agents rarely have clear agreements between them about roles. Prime Contractors need assurance that all communication will be shared with them and that their client relationships will be preserved.\n\nFrom the point of view of the Prime Contractor, the cost of landing an engagement is highest in the beginning, when they may do extra work or discount their fee to win the deal. This sometimes leads them to jealously guard the client, knowing that they will only become profitable with subsequent contracts.\n\nThe second rule promotes honoring all parties, keeping in mind that one’s reputation is all-important. At the same time, because any person can fulfill any role, if a Prime Contractor consistently shirks their duties, there is a mechanism in place for a client to hire a subcontractor directly. In this case, the subcontractor and Prime Contractor switch roles, which is reflected in their earnings.\n\nHonor your own identity (whether you are the Prime or the Sub)\n\nThe third rule acknowledges that constantly switching one’s identity is a hard thing to do, and therefore advises against it. Instead, each subcontractor should use their own name, their own business card, and their own identity in most cases.\n\nReveal the network to the client\n\nBuilding on the previous rule, FAE advises revealing the free agent network to the client, instead of keeping it a secret or pretending to be a bigger company. By disclosing upfront to the client the source of the labor being performed, any future confusion or embarrassment can be avoided.\n\nThis rule assumes a somewhat open-minded and progressive working relationship with the client. But for those clients willing to try this new way of working, the network standing behind the Prime can even be framed as a competitive advantage: lower transaction costs, lower coordination costs, better match between talent and the project, more flexibility, and lower overhead to pay for.\n\nManage and share your knowledge (client and transactional info)\n\nWith so many links in the value chain, knowledge management becomes even more critical than it already is. All the “nodes in the network” have to make their knowledge of the client’s needs and background more explicit and tangible, to be shared with their collaborators.\n\nRule #5 reflects that the value of a lead is increased with every detail about the prospect’s needs, decision makers, and history. The more past proposals, notes, contracts, and document examples available to the ecosystem, the more effective every link in the chain can become. This should incentivize everything from good note-taking, to improving templates, to maintaining CRMs, to making warm introductions.\n\nFree agents can also use copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property agreements to reward each other for producing valuable documents and products. The entire ecosystem benefits when one of its members has authored or created concrete “knowledge products” such as books, videos, courses, or blog posts, and could reward the leads generated by this content accordingly.\n\nShow up and add value\n\nAlthough this responsibility is clearly assigned to the Prime Contractor, rule #6 reminds everyone that it is their job to self-manage, find direction, and position themselves to deliver value. They have to use their own senses and energy, not a boss or manager, to figure out what needs doing, and to do it.\n\nThe purpose of this rule is to encourage a new version of leadership that focuses far more on developing visions of a bright future, and less time on motivating people to do what needs to be done.\n\nDo the right thing – choose win-win-win outcomes\n\nSince a Prime today could be a subcontractor tomorrow, it becomes important to accrue “goodwill points” from everyone you work with, not just your superiors. You never know from where the next opportunity will come.\n\nFAE effectively creates a marketplace of buyers and sellers, bringing fairness and transparency to the world of high-end professional services that has for so long been cloaked in secrecy.\n\nOn the upside, good choices and generous actions spread just as fast, allowing people who do good, quiet work to shine just as brightly as those who more naturally seek the spotlight.\n\nThe templates provided in the FAE framework include:\n\n1.  Subcontractor or Independent Contractor Agreement\n2.  Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement\n3.  Intellectual Property Compensation Agreements (royalties, use agreements, licensing)\n4.  Work Order (for each project including fees, logistics, etc.)\n\nFor example, a typical Subcontractor Agreement might include the following sections:\n\n1.  Statement Of Work\n2.  Compensation\n3.  Progress Reporting And Payment\n4.  Term and Termination\n5.  Independent Contractor Status\n6.  Confidential Information\n7.  Intellectual Property\n8.  Warranties and Representations\n9.  Restrictive Covenant\n10.  Insurance\n11.  Trademark and Trade Name\n12.  Indemnification\n13.  General Provisions\n14.  Dispute Resolution Procedures\n\nA standard Work Order might include:\n\n-   Specific statement of work including **desired outcomes and timeline of the work**\n-   Compensation, including the Prime’s **policy for reimbursable expenses**\n-   **Client contact information** (names, titles, phone numbers, emails, websites, mailing addresses) including short descriptions or notes on key engagement sponsors\n-   **Contact information and roles regarding other Subcontractors** involved in the engagement\n-   **Logistics** including location of event or consulting venues and client offices, travel arrangements, catering arrangements, and necessary equipment and furnishings\n-   **Sources for various intellectual property/materials** (workbooks, event designs, articles, software, assessments, etc.), especially when they are being sourced from a third party not involved in the delivery of the engagement\n-   **Any specific performance expectations** (length of work day, dress code, requirements for message response cycle time, etc.)\n\nGood agreements tend to make the involved parties more thoughtful about engaging with one another, surface innocently hidden assumptions, and increase specificity around money. These agreements form specific boundaries around each transaction, set out timing for certain activities, and define roles and responsibilities clearly. Their purpose is to create a safe environment for sharing ideas and derivative products, and make clear how money will be exchanged for services and products.\n\nBut once we have modular projects among otherwise unassociated contractors, the game changes. When you are _billed_ for accessing a collaborator’s time, the priorities shift. Suddenly, you might be willing to pay them to document their knowledge. You might be willing to spend some time beforehand reviewing their public work, before getting on that phone call.\n\nAs the price of their time goes up, new possibilities emerge. You may be willing to license their intellectual property, because it’s cheaper than their time. If we put a proper price on the terribly inefficient methods we use today for sharing what we know, knowledge management might actually become a central part of how we do our work.\n\n## References\n\nForte, T.

    "content": "\n![Helen Keller and teacher](Helen-Keller.jpg)\n\n\u003e There is joy in self-forgetfulness. So I try to make the light in others' eyes my sun, the music in others' ears my symphony, the smile on others' lips my happiness.\n\n\\- Helen Keller\n\nHelen Keller was born deaf and blind. Her condition forced her to think about herself most of the time. It took longer for her to accomplish things that most people do pretty fast—like reading. She spent more time taking care of herself and nurturing her own growth. And this is why she became the great Helen Keller—the most educated deaf and blind girl in her time.\n\nBecause she had to work hard for her education, she was left in the comforts of herself most of the time. In her autobiography, she admitted that books, rather than people, were her constant companion. They were like a little \"society\" of hers.\n\nThis is typical for people with disabilities, chronic illnesses, or other afflictions. They tend to focus on themselves a lot. I noticed this on others when I was a sign language interpreter with the Deaf and also on myself when I was recovering from depression. But this tendency to be self-absorbed when under such circumstances should be understandable. How and why would people with disabilities and chronic illnesses think of other people first when they have their very own \"unfair\" share of obstacles?\n\nInterestingly, Helen Keller's story later in her life sheds a different light on this question. While she spent most of her time alone with her books as a child, she started to see the beauty in thinking about other people as she got older, as the quote which began this essay suggests. Her care for others even went as far as her adopting a radical communist political ideology later in her life.\n\nHelen Keller's story suggests that while disability or life issues will keep us from thinking about others, we are so hardwired to be social beings that it is so difficult to escape this desire to help others, be part of a community, and contribute to the growth of people we care about.\n\n\u003e All of us are born to connect, hardwired to live in the company of those who know and love us. When we draw from deep wells of social support—the care and concern of close friends, family, and community—we’re more resilient to the slings and arrows of fortune, and we’re considerably less vulnerable to depression. Social connection helps push the brain in an antidepressant direction, turning down activity in stress circuitry, and boosting the activity of feel-good brain chemicals like dopamine and serotonin. That’s why it makes sense to swim hard against the tide of our “culture of isolation” and to place our relationships at the very top of the priority list. Truly, nothing in life matters more.\n\n\\- Stephen S. Ilardi\n\nThere is happiness in forgetting about ourselves and giving our attention to someone in need of it.\n\nBut which of these two provides the most happiness?\n\nI propose that there is no one answer to this question but rather a myriad of possible answers. Happiness is subjective as it is unquantifiable by standard measurements.\n\nI can only speak for myself, and what I would say is that we will be more fulfilled if we find the convergence between our personal desires and that of the others. **_Thinking about ourselves can help us find direction in a rather directionless life while thinking about others and serving them can provide meaning in a rather meaningless existence._**\n\nDoes this mean that both thinking about oneself and thinking about other people serve the egotistic desire of self-actualization? Not really. This is simply the fact of life.\n\nWe give and the universe is generous enough to give back. Not because it knows we want something in return but simply because people resonate with the kindness in us, and like us, most people are filled with more positive emotions than we might expect.\n\nThere is happiness in self-forgetfulness because it stops the mind from thinking about questions that will take decades to answer: Who am I? What am I here for?\n\nSelf-forgetfulness shifts our focus from endless thoughts we could ponder about to concrete actions we could take—actions that, hopefully, touch the lives of so many others who are waiting for what we can offer.\n",

    "content": "\n# Foreword\n\nWhat is essential in the practice of yoga is the breath because each pose, each movement, originates from there. This balanced union brings harmony and order to our bodies and minds.\n\n# The Life and Yoga of Sri T. Krishnamacharya\n\nOn studying yoga, attend to your uniqueness as an individual.\n\nStart where you are.\n\nStart on what you need.\n\nYour approach will be and should be different from that of others.\n\nThe yoga practice must be tailored to fit each person.\n\nYou must find your own structure.\n\nYoga serves the individual through inviting transformation rather than by giving information.\n\nImportant questions to ask in beginning a practice:\n\n1. Who should teach whom?\n2. When?\n3. What?\n4. How can the power of the breath be utilized? (most important)\n\nBefore you begin, be clear about the various aspects of the asana you wish to practice.\n\nPrepare to reduce or negate undesired effects.\n\nWork towards your goal step by step.\n\nYoga is not just a physical practice.\n\nYoga is about reaching God.\n\nYoga is about taking steps that would lead to God in order to become one with God.\n\nA strong will, trust, and ability to keep up one’s efforts constantly is needed.\n\nIllness can distract the attention towards this goal.\n\nBe devoted to God not to our physical pains.\n\nThe body is not the centre of all activities.\n\nYoga is primarily a practice intended to make someone wiser, more able to understand things than they were before.\n\nThe goal is always bhakti or to approach the highest intelligence, namely, God.\n\nBooks on Yoga\n\n- Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra\n- Nathamuni’s Yoga Rahasya\n- Bhagavad Gita\n- Hatha Yoga Pradipika\n\nUnderstanding the Yoga Sutra is a lifelong task. Each time you read it you can see something more, something different.\n\nSannyasin\n\n- Give yourself totally to a higher power, to God.\n- To lay all that you do at the feet of your teacher or God.\n\nInvolve yourself in life while doing yoga. No need for seclusion.\n\nStudying texts provide the content of your practice and make what you are doing comprehensible.\n\nWork in your own environment and then meet with a teacher from time to time.\n\nThere has to be a relationship with a teacher based on trust.\n\nAdvaita\n\n- a- and dvaita\n- Advaita = nondualism\n- Dvaita = dualism\n- To realize advaita, one must first realize dvaita.\n- To realize nondualism, one must first realize dualism.\n- We must start with the reality of our situation.\n- Accept duality. Start from duality.\n- Yoga links dualism and nondualism.\n- Yoga is the step toward advaita.\n- Dvaita -\u003e Yoga -\u003e Advaita.\n- Dvaita and advaita must be recognised then brought together.\n- Your goal is nondualism and use yoga to achieve that.\n\nYoga is not fixed. It’s okay if different people have different perspectives on yoga.\n\nThe purpose of yoga is to bring some change.\n\nThe teacher is the reference point.\n\nYoga is intimate.\n\nYoga is between two - the teacher and the student.\n\nThere has to be an intimate relationship between you and your teacher.\n\nDo yoga step by step and you will not have problems.\n\nEnjoy each step.\n\nDo not try to leap many steps at once.\n\nYou cannot practice every kind of yoga.\n\nPractice the yoga that is right for you.\n\nMeet with your teacher and decide on a program that suits you.\n\nYour guru simply shows you the way.\n\nBut you go your own way.\n\nYou do not need to follow your guru’s destination.\n\nFollowing your guru’s destination is a way of loosing yourself.\n\nSvadharma - “your own dharma” or “your own way\"\n\nIf you try to do somebody else’s dharma, trouble happens.\n\nBe humble.\n\nAs a wise person, you don’t need to say “I am clear. I am wise.\"\n\nHumility is one of the qualities of a clear person.\n\nThere is nothing to prove to anybody.\n\n# Chapter 1 - Yoga: Concept and Meaning\n\n**Darsana**\n\n- [ ] Six fundamental systems of Indian thought.\n- [ ] Lit. means sight, view, point of view, or certain way of seeing.\n- [ ] A mirror which we can look inside ourselves\n1.

Deep within us, free from avidya\n2. Superficial and obscured with avidya.\n\nThe goal of yoga is to reduce the film of avidya in order to act correctly.\n\nAvidya is hidden from us.\n\nIts branches are easier to identify.\n\n**4 Branches of Avidya**\n\n1. Ego (Asmita)\n2. Raga - making demands. Wanting things we do not have. What we have is not enough. We want more. We want to keep things we are asked to give away.\n3. Dvesa - opposite of Raga. Rejecting things. Rejecting people, thoughts, and settings related to a past difficult experience. Rejecting unfamiliar things.\n4. Abhinivesa - fear. Most secret. Found in many levels of every day life. Uncertainty. Doubts.\n\nThese 4 branches cloud our perceptions.\n\nThey result to a feeling of dissatisfaction.\n\nComparison leads to satisfaction based on a sense of superiority or dissatisfaction based on a sense of inferiority.\n\nYoga decreases the effects of avidya so that true understanding can take place.\n\nWhat does it feel like when avidya is absent?\n\n- Profound peace inside us.\n- No tension.\n- No unrest.\n- No agitation.\n- Quietness and calmness deep within us.\n\n**Satvada**\n\nEverything we see, experience, and feel is not illusion.\n\nEverything is real (dreams, ideas, fantasies, avidya).\n\n**Parinamavada**\n\nAll form and content are in a constant state of flux.\n\nContinual change.\n\nWe do not need to be discouraged with the presence of avidya.\n\nBad can be better (or worse).\n\nWe never know what will happen in life so we must be attentive.\n\nWe must practice yoga regularly so we can stay present and attentive.\n\n**Purusa or Drastr**\n\nLit. means “that which sees” or “that which can see correctly\"\n\nDeep within us is something that is very real.\n\nIt is not subject to change.\n\nThe power within us that enables us to perceive with accuracy.\n\nRecognising our mind’s shift from cloudiness to clarity is a good way to measure our progress.\n\nIs it an expression of asmita (the ego) when someone begins yoga because he or she wants to be better?\n\nWanting to be better is based on asmita (the ego).\n\nBut it is still a right step because it brings us to yoga.\n\nSelf-improvement may be our initial goal but it is not a permanent goal.\n\nThe recognition and conquest of avidya is the only ladder by which we can climb upward.\n\nBy practicing yoga we improve:\n\n- our ability to concentrate\n- our ability to be independent\n- our health\n- our relationships\n- everything we do\n\n**How can we climb the ladder?**\n\n**Kriya Yoga (The Yoga of Action)**\n\n- [ ] Kr = “to do\"\n- [ ] The means by which we achieve yoga as a state of being.\n- [ ] The practical branch of yoga.\n- [ ] Leads to change for the better in all aspects of our life.\n- [ ] Three parts: health, inquiry, and quality of action\n\n***Tapas (Health)***\n\n- [ ] Tap\n- [ ] To heat or cleanse\n- [ ] A means by which we can keep ourselves healthy and cleanse ourselves inwardly\n- [ ] Penance, mortification, and strict diet\n- [ ] The practice of asanas (physical) and pranayama (breathing) exercises of yoga.\n- [ ] These practices get rid of blocks and impurities in our system.\n- [ ] Heating gold to purify it.\n\n***Svadhyaya (Inquiry)***\n\n- [ ] Sva = self\n- [ ] Adhyaya = study or investigation\n- [ ] Knowing ourselves\n- [ ] Who are we?

Sukha - ability to remain comfortable in a posture.\n\nBoth should be present to the same degree when practicing any posture.\n\nWithout both these qualities there is no asana.\n\nPractice a particular asana until you feel alert and unstressed as you do it.\n\n**How to achieve Sthira and Sukha?**\n\n***Begin from where you are***\n\n- [ ] Practice something easier, something we can do at this point in time.\n- [ ] Accept ourselves as who we are.\n- [ ] Recognise our starting point and accept it.\n\n***Join breath with movement***\n\n- [ ] The quality of breath expresses our inner feelings.\n- [ ] The breath is the link between the inner and outer body.\n- [ ] Bring body, breath, and mind into unison.\n- [ ] Explore the breath: make the inhalation as long as possible.\n- [ ] Explore the body: raise arms on and inhale and lower arms on an exhale.\n- [ ] First step of yoga practice: consciously link breath and body.\n- [ ] Allow every movement to be led by the breath as we practice asanas.\n- [ ] For breath and movement to be coordinated, our mind must attentively follow their union.\n- [ ] Inhalation and exhalation become a conscious process (rather than automatic).\n- [ ] Determine whether it is the inhalation or the exhalation that is amplified or made easier by a certain movement. Combine that breathe to the movement we are focusing.\n- [ ] Be fully involved with our actions.\n- [ ] The consciously directed breath supports and strengthen the natural coordination of breath and movement.\n- [ ] Contract body = exhale\n- [ ] Expand body = inhale\n- [ ] Let the breathing initiate the movement\n- [ ] The length of the breath determines the speed of the movement\n- [ ] Avoid mindless repetition\n- [ ] Avoid mechanical practice\n- [ ] How? Introduce a short pause at the end of every movement.\n\n***The Fullness of Breath***\n\n- [ ] Aim to make both inhalation and exhalation fuller and deeper than it normally is.\n- [ ] Technique: consciously expand the chest and abdomen on inhalation and consciously contract the abdomen on exhalation.\n- [ ] Technique + Breath + Movement = Deep Yoga Practice\n- [ ] Inhale = fill the chest and then fill the abdomen. Exhale = release the abdomen then finally empty the upper lobes of the lungs in the chest region.\n- [ ] This stretches the spine and straightens the back.\n- [ ] Aim for breathing that assists the movements of the body and does not hinder the extension of the spine.\n\n***The Breath is the Intelligence of the Body***\n\n- [ ] When practicing an asana, our attention should be directed toward the central point of the movement of breath.\n- [ ] Inhale = upper chest to the navel; Exhale = abdomen\n- [ ] Consciously following the breath is a form of meditation in which we try to become completely one with the movement.\n\n**2 Techniques**\n\n***Ujjayi***\n\n- [ ] Narrow the flow of breath in the throat\n- [ ] Produce a gentle breathing sound\n- [ ] Gentle, should not require any effort or create tension\n- [ ] Hear and feel the breath deeper and longer\n- [ ] If you do not succeed in maintaining a gentle, even, quiet sound, then you have gone beyond the limits of your practice.\n- [ ] The quality of breath is the clearest indication of the quality of an asana practice.\n\n***Lengthen the natural pause between exhalation and inhalation and vice versa.***\n\n- [ ] Breathe out -\u003e Hold breath + Stop moving -\u003e Breathe in\n- [ ] Breathe in -\u003e Hold breath + Stop moving -\u003e Breathe out\n- [ ] Holding the breath should not disturb the inhalation and exhalation\n- [ ] Be certain you are ready for this technique before using it.\n\n***Steps***\n\n1. Breathe comfortably for 5 secs.\n2. Breathe our for 5 secs.\n3. Hold breath for 5 secs.\n4. Observe if you need to draw the breath in more rapidly than before.\n\n**Yoga**\n\n- [ ] experienced inside\n- [ ] not external\n- [ ] be attentive to everything we do\n- [ ] we do yoga for ourselves not for other people\n- [ ] we are both observer and observed\n\n**Asanas to Practice**\n\n***Exhalation***\n\n1. Uttanasana (standing forward bend)\n2. Variation of Cakravakasana (cat pose)\n3. Beginning matsyendrasana (half spinal twist)\n\n***Inhalation***\n\n1. Dvipada pitham (table pose)\n2. Bhujangasana (cobra pose)\n\n# Chapter 4 - The Careful Construction of a Yoga Practice\n\n[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6\u0026q=16.056731,120.453676)\n\n**Sthirasukha**\n\n- [ ] Develop gentleness and steadiness.\n- [ ] Exert progressively less effort in developing them.\n\nPractice has to be sensible and well structured.\n\nStarting point - condition of our entire being at that present moment.\n\nKnow as much as possible about our constitution.\n\nPractice according with our abilities.\n\n**Vinyasa Krama**\n\n- [ ] Krama = step\n- [ ] Nyasa = to place\n- [ ] Vi = in a special way\n- [ ] To place a step in a special way\n- [ ] It is not enough to simply take a step. That step needs to take us in the right direction and be made in the right way.\n- [ ] Correctly organised yoga practice.\n- [ ] Construct a gradual and intelligent course for your practice (asana, pranayama, or other aspect of yoga).\n- [ ] Start where you are.\n- [ ] Look toward a certain goal.\n- [ ] Choose the steps that will lead you toward realising that goal.\n- [ ] Choose the steps that will gradually bring you back into your everyday life.\n- [ ] Apply vinyasa krama in every day life.\n- [ ] Gain an understanding of the steps necessary for preparing your body, your breath, and your attention for the asana you have chosen to practice.\n- [ ] Consider immediate or long-term danger of problems arising from the practice of this asana.\n- [ ] Determine the poses necessary to bring balance to the breath and body.\n\n**Pratikriyasana**\n\n- [ ] Every action has two effects: negative and positive.\n- [ ] Be attentive to our actions.\n- [ ] Identify which are positive and which are negative.\n- [ ] Emphasise the positive.\n- [ ] Neutralise the negative.\n- [ ] Use neutralizing postures or counterposes (pratikriyasana) to balance the possibly negative effects of certain strenuous asanas.\n- [ ] Prati = against; counter\n- [ ] Kr = to do\n\nProper asana practice is not just a matter of advancing step by step to a certain goal; we also have to come back into a position from which we can comfortably resume our everyday activities without experiencing any harmful effects from our practice.\n\nIt is not enough to climb the tree; we must be able to get down too.\n\nWhenever we feel excessive tension in any area of the body after a posture, we must try to alleviate it with a counterpose; that is, the simplest asana that relieves the tension.\n\nBring vinyasa krama into your asana practice by observing the principle of dual effects in determining the sequence of asanas in your session.\n\nIn practicing your asana, be aware of vinyasa krama every step of the way.\n\n**Examples of Counterposes**\n\n1. Headstand (sirsasana) = shoulderstand (sarvangasana)\n2. Powerful forward bend = gentle back bend\n3. Powerful back bend = simple forward bend\n\n**How to Design a Session**\n\nThe way we develop our session will depend on:\n\n- [ ] our immediate needs\n- [ ] our long-term goals\n- [ ] what activities are going to follow our practice\n\nIt is entirely up to the student, in light of both his lifestyles and goals, to determine whether it makes sense to practice many or only a few asanas and to determine which ones are worthwhile.\n\nFind a direction for your practice.\n\nDraw up a sequence of asanas that meets your needs.\n\nConsider the qualities that are to be found in the asana.\n\nA teacher is an important resource in helping you make these choices.\n\nOur point of departure for practice will be different every day.\n\nPractice observing yourself so you can find your own starting point each time.\n\nThe situation from which you begin your practice is constantly changing.\n\nExamine your condition before starting and continually throughout our practice.\n\nBefore doing an asana be sure that the body is ready for it.\n\nDo gentle warm-up exercises.\n\nBegin your practice with the simplest poses.\n\nBend the body forward naturally.\n\nRaise your arms or legs.\n\nBegin with the simplest postures.\n\nGradually progress toward more difficult ones.\n\n**Asanas to Begin a Practice**\n\n1. Tadasana (Mountain Pose)\n2. Uttanasana (Forward Bend)\n3. Apanasana (Wind-relieving Pose)\n4. Raised Vajrasana (Thunderbolt Pose)\n\n**Asanas to Avoid when Just Beginning**\n\n1. Sirsasana (Headstand)\n2. Trikonasana (Triangle Pose)\n3. Dhanurasana (Bow Pose)\n4. Halasana (Plow Pose)\n\n**2 Ways of Practicing an Asana**\n\n*Dynamic Practice*\n\n- [ ] Repeat movement in the asana.\n- [ ] Out again in rhythm with the breath.\n- [ ] Continual movement with the breath.\n- [ ] Allows the body to get used to the position gradually and gently.\n- [ ] Start with dynamic practice first.\n- [ ] Prepares us for difficult static postures.\n- [ ] Brings breath to body parts and heightens the intensity of the effect.\n- [ ] Must always be part of a yoga session.\n\n*Static Practice*\n\n- [ ] Similar to dynamic. Move in and out of the pose.\n- [ ] Hold the pose for a certain number of breath cycles.\n- [ ] Direct attention to breath, to a body part, or both.\n\nExplore the possibilities of the asana instead of focusing on fixing the posture.\n\n**Asanas to Practice (dynamically)**\n\n1. Pascimatanasana (seated forward bend)\n2. Parsva Uttanasana (standing forward bend)\n\n**On Repetitions**\n\nStop repetitions when:\n\n- Tiredness is felt.\n- Muscle strain.\n- Breath\n\nThe moment we have to draw a rapid breath through the nose or mouth without maintaining the gentle, even sound in the throat, we must stop practicing the sequence.\n\nGradually build stamina.\n\nPractice dynamic variations of a particular long-term asana goal.\n\nPractice counterposes dynamically.\n\n**Counterposes**\n\nCreate and practice sequences in which poses and counterposes follow each other.\n\n*Counterposes for Headstand*\n\n1. Apanasana (Wind-relieving Pose) - for sway back\n2. Sarvangasana (Shoulderstand) - relieves pressure on the neck. Counterpose it with Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose).\n\n*Counterposes for Uttanasana*\n\n1. Utkatasana (Squatting Pose) - tension on legs after uttanasana.\n2. Cakravakasana (Cat Pose) - sore back after uttanasana.\n3. Savasana (Corpse Pose) - rest back\n\n**Principles of a Good Yoga Practice**\n\n- Begin where you are\n- Warm up and loosen the whole body at the start of a session\n- Before you perform an asana, make sure you know and can perform an appropriate counterpose\n- Practice an asana dynamically before holding it\n- Practice the counterpose immediately following the main asana\n- Make sure the counterpose is simpler than the main asana\n\n**Breath**\n\n*4 Parts*\n\n1. The inhalation\n2. The exhalation\n3. The retention after inhalation\n4. The retention after exhalation\n\nBreath retention intensify the effects of a posture.\n\n*Principles*\n\n*1. Langhana (meaning to fast or to reduce)*\n\n- [ ] Long exhalation + holding the breath after exhalation = intensified effects of posture in abdominal area\n- [ ] Supports the elimination process\n- [ ] Cleansing effect on the body\n- [ ] Enlivens the organs especially in the abdominal region\n\n*2. Brmhana (meaning to expand)*\n\n- [ ] Long inhalation + holding the breath after inhalation = intensified effects of posture on chest area\n- [ ] Energizes and heats the body\n- [ ] Good for someone who lacks energy\n- [ ] Langhana should be achieved first before Brmhana\n- [ ] Too much fire without elimination can create disturbing patterns of energy\n- [ ] To receive that which is new (fresh energy), we must first release what is old and no longer benefits us\n\n*Asanas to Practice*\n\n*1. Virabhadrasana (Warrior Pose)*\n\n- [ ] Works with Brmhana way\n- [ ] Practice with a long inhalation\n- [ ] Followed by short breath retention\n\n*2. Seated Forward Bend*\n\n- [ ] Works with Langhana\n- [ ] Practice with a seliberate and slow exhalation\n- [ ] Followed by holding the breath\n\n*Rules*\n\nIf holding the breath reduces the duration of your next inhale or exhale, stop.\n\nYou are not ready for this practice.\n\nWork up to it instead.\n\nThe breath should never be held if there is a sudden increase in the pulse rate.\n\nIf the breathing is poor, the pulse increases.\n\nHolding the breath should never make us uneasy.\n\nWe should be able to quietly observe the quality of our breathing.\n\n**Resting**\n\nRest between asanas.\n\nRest when we become out of breath.\n\nRest when we are no longer able to control our breath.\n\nCertain parts of the body may become tired or sore and we must rest them.\n\nIf we need rest, we take one.\n\nRest to make a transition between one kind of asana and another.\n\nWe must rest even if we don not feel the need for it.\n\nRest gives us the opportunity to feel the effects of the posture.\n\nRest allows the muscles time to return to their balanced tone.\n\nRest and observe the reaction of our muscles and whole body.\n\nRest is needed when practicing pranayama.\n\nAsana -\u003e body\n\nPranayama -\u003e breath\n\nRest after Asana and before Pranayama\n\n15 mins. asanas = 2-3 minutes rest -\u003e Pranayama\n\n1+ hour asanas = 5 minutes rest -\u003e Pranayama\n\n**Seek Teacher Advice**\n\nYoga = practice of self-examination\n\nAsanas + Pranayama = self-discovery\n\nBut\n\n- [ ] We cannot always trust our own perceptions.\n- [ ] Our habitual way of seeing limits our self-understanding\n\nA teacher is not limited by our unique conditioning.\n\nHe can see what capacities lie hidden in us.\n\nA good teacher is important for finding out which postures are most useful, and on which ones the student needs guidance.\n\n**Asana Sequences**\n\n*General Asana Sequence*\n\n1. Standing exercises to warm up with - (5-10 minutes) Experience and observe the state of our body and breath. Find out about our physical and mental states.\n2. Exercises lying on the back - Preparation for inverted postures.\n3. Inverted postures - Allow us to discover new previously unknown aspects of ourselves.\n4. Exercises lying on the belly - All back bends.\n5. Exercises in a sitting or kneeling position\n6. Rest lying on the back\n7. Breathing exercises\n\n*Minimum Pranayama Preparation Sequence*\n\n1. Uttanasana - forward bend for warm up\n2. Dvipada pitham - table pose, prepare the back and neck + experience the quality of our breath\n3. Cakravakasana - cat pose, opens the chest and back\n4. Savasana - corpse pose, rest lying on the back - concludes asana practice\n5. Sukhasana - cross-legged position to practice pranayama.\n6. Sit on a chair\n\n**Time and Day of Practice**\n\nWait 2 or 3 hours following a meal to begin yoga practice.\n\nPractice on an empty stomach.\n\nBest time for practice is before breakfast.\n\nPractice daily.\n\nSession should always be made up of a balanced group of exercises.\n\nPlan short asana sequences for days with little time.\n\nAlways adhere to the principle of vinyasa krama.\n\nConstruct a gradual and intelligent course for your yoga practice that helps you meet your goals.\n\n# Chapter 5 - Asana Variations\n\nReasons why asanas should be practiced in various ways\n\n1. To extend our physical capabilities.\n2. To encourage attentiveness by breaking routine.\n\nWays of varying an asana\n\n1. Alter its form.\n2. Vary the breath.\n3. Vary the rhythm.\n4. Vary the preparation.\n5. Vary the sphere of attention.\n\nIn every yoga posture lies a principle.\n\nUnderstand the principle to perform the asana or variation of it in the proper way.\n\nWhat does this asana mean?\n\nWhat is its purpose?\n\nWhat does it demand of us?\n\n“The feeling of the breath” = feeling of energy or prank moving in the body.\n\nMaintain the link between breath and body.\n\nBreath - be with the whole body + observe the asana.\n\nMonitor the asana with the number of breaths and the breath ratio (inhale-pause-exhale-pause) that is appropriate for us.\n\nBreath must be smooth and has continuity.\n\nBreath and body = one movement, one process -\u003e powerful yoga\n\nThe breath is one of the best means for observing yourself in your yoga practice.\n\nHow does the body respond to the breath, and how does the breath respond to the movement of the body?\n\n# Chapter 6 - Pranayama\n\n[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6\u0026q=16.056843,120.453695)\n\n## References",

This should be philosophy then, according to Bugbee.\n\nHe differentiates this from usual \"research,\" which involves a lot of ''tilling.'' This \"tilling\" may actually bury that which wants to come out.[^1] What wants to come out is insight and insight comes out suddenly ([[Insight cannot be predetermined]]). Bugbee speaks of insight as having a life of its own. It has to be allowed to grow organically. When one moulds it into theory or makes it public, one starts to lose it.\n\nTherefore, Bugbee's admonition is just to write everything down. When they come, write them down without thinking about how they will add up. Just flow. Like a poem, move from one perception to another. And this reminds me a lot of [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]]. This is also how he saw insights and perhaps why he valued his journal because it is there where the first development or capture of insight comes from. \n\nThis makes me think about the [[Seeds]] (i.e., field notes I take while walking and fleeting notes I take when reading). I need to publish and share them too, but I don't want to share my daily notes. So what I might try to do is to create separate notes for them. Connect them in the daily note but separate them. These will be the seeds collected on a specific tag.\n\n[^1]: This reminds me of the metaphor I am using for my entire philosophical journey: [[thoughts/forest garden of the mind]]\n\n# References\n\nBugbee, H.

The right response to something like this is just to let it [[Flow]]. If we let it flow, one after the other, they will reveal themselves. This process, however, isn't [[Analytic philosophy]]. This is a release of \"truth\" that we have within us. Since philosophical truth comes from the depth, it is expected that it isn't clear and it doesn't know where it is going.\n\nTherefore, [[Certainty]] to truth claims shouldn't be what we must aspire to, but \"certainty of [[thoughts/action]].\" If an action is sound, we may be certain of it. And we may not articulate the reason for an action clearly. We simply do it. Here, certainty is akin to faith and hope.\n\nI do not know if I am ready to agree with Bugbee here, particularly with the last part. But I understand what he is saying. If certainty is tied to action, it is impossible to be totally certain about the repercussions of action. [[We learn to live while we are living]]. We learn as we go. The questions that make us \"uncertain\" are only answered when we take action. Here, certainty is achieving decisiveness even when one is unsure. Certainty is faith.\n\n# References\n\nBugbee, H.

    "content": "\n## Thursday, August 28, 1952\n\n[[thoughts/henry bugbee]] expands his conception of \"[[Certainty]].\" He repeats that certainty is a \"basis for [[thoughts/action]].\" Therefore, it is the trigger to a beginning rather than a landmark for arrival. Certainty is not the closure of an endeavor. It is the beginning of action.\n\nEvery situation is absolute. This moment is itself. It will never change. According to Bugbee, when we realize this absolute nature of every moment, when we become sensitive to it, we start interpreting each moment, each action deeply—we start to live in \"the depth of our experience.\"\n\nCertainty is the simplicity—or the \"being used to\"—this state of being. You are so used to this realization that each moment is absolute that it is who you are. You don't think about it. Certainty then cannot be \"attained,\" Bugbee says. Given this, we have to confront the question: If certainty cannot be \"attained,\" the what use is reflection? Is reflection detrimental or supportive to certainty? Bugbee posits that [[thoughts/meditation]] or reflection is harmonious with the absoluteness of our situation. If that is the case, then reflection or meditation enhances certainty.\n\nAt this point, I am reminded of his argument yesterday that \"certainty is faith.\" The moment an individual thrown into this world realizes his throwness, he is confronted by the question of how to respond to this throwness. Should he respond with aggression? Should he kill himself? Or should he befriend this world? At this time, he doesn't know anything or almost know nothing that will help him make a decision. He is just at the beginning of his journey. But at that moment, he needs to make a decision. It is impossible to \"research\" the situation. The moment he doesn't kill himself, he automatically chooses to befriend his situation and the world (but is he doing this just according to instinct or to preserve himself?). If he is doing this consciously then, yes, he has \"chosen\" friendship. And if he did this in the depth of his experience (i.e., realizing that each moment is absolute), then he did this decision based on \"faith\" alone. No evidence was gathered.\n\nThis faith is faith that there is smething worthwhile to be had by attempting a friendship with the world. The only things I am bothered about Bugbee's idea about certainty is this rejection that it is something one can attain. I think if one continues to realize the absoluteness of each moment and one couples this with meditation and reflection, these are things that could enhance one's friendship with certainty. In this sense, certainty can be \"achieved\" and maintained through continuous practice.\n\n# References\n\nBugbee, H. (1999). _The Inward Morning: A Philosophical Exploration in Journal Form_.

    "content": "\n## Friday, August 29, 1952\n\nI am starting to fear that the more I immerse myself into [[thoughts/henry bugbee]]'s philosophy, the more I need to embrace irrationality and related concepts. I hope not. It seems that this is inevitatable as I set myself to study a different brand of [[thoughts/philosophy]]—one that isn't analytical but lyrical ([[thoughts/lyrical philosophy]]).\n\nIn August 29, Bugbee shifts his discussion from [[Certainty]] to [[thoughts/wonder]] (later, he returns to certainty). He agrees with [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] that \"wonder marks the inception of philosphy.\" However, he felt like Aristotle, in particular, failed to elaborate this notion in a manner it deserves. Bugbee seems to propose that wonder and [[Curiosity]] are opposites, which I think makes sense. When you wonder, you may continue to question but you become contented with basking in those questions. When you are curious, you are propelled to answer the question; you believe that there is an answer and you don't stop until you get it.\n\nAristotle thinks differently. He sees wonder as what we experience when we feel we cannot articulate why we are moved to research something (?). He also thinks that philosophizing diminishes the initial wonder that started it in the first place. And so, once we begin to articulate the reason for our curiosity, wonder starts to fade away. Once we realize that the object of our wonder is in fact explicable, our wonder diminishes.\n\nThere are objects of wonder however that cannot be explained, and in these we experience the \"ultimate occasion for incorrigible wonder\" and the \"irrelevance of explanation.\" Bugbee uses the example of Aristotle's [[unmoved mover]].\n\nThis unmoved mover has no beginning or end. It is unchanging and immovable. This unmoved mover, which Aristotle is prepared to call God, Bugbee argues, would make reflection eventuate into endless wonder. For the unmoved mover, explanation becomes irrelevant. Bugbee also calls the unmoved mover as \"self-caused.\"\n\nThis notion works perfectly well with a finitist view of the world ([[Infinity cannot exist]]). I get it now. We cannot explain where this unmoved mover came from. We only know that for everything to move, for logic to make sense, this unmove mover must exist.\n\nAnd since it is probably platonic or in a completely different realm, we have to surrender to the truth that we cannot completely grasp it. So we can explain all we want but when we reach that point—the unmoved mover—explanation becomes irrelevant, mystery takes over, and we are just let in wonder.\n\n# References\n\nBugbee, H.

    "content": "\nAfter expressing his thoughts about explanation ([[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-08-30]]), [[thoughts/henry bugbee]] returns to discussing [[thoughts/wonder]] as he did before ([[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-08-29]]). Wonder, he says, occurs during presence. This presence allows us to experience \"an intimation of reality\" that cannot be understood through explanation alone.\n\nThe presence that exudes wonder then makes us realize that our minds are naturally wanderers, dependent and inclined to thinking and explanation. Based on personal experience, [[Meditation makes us realize we do not control the influx of our thoughts]]. Our mind just walks around, jumps around from one thought to another. It is not difficult to realize this; one almost realizes it the moment meditation begins.\n\nBugbee calls this inclination of our minds to wander a manifestation of its homeless nature. We are exiles. We can deny this nature or we can embrace it and patiently wait for \"that which can make us at home in this condition.\"\n\nIs wonder that thing which makes us experience it, that which makes us at home? I believe so. As he said in [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-08-29]], an \"ultimate occasion for incorrigible wonder\" begins when explanation becomes irrelevant, as is the case with Aristotle's [[unmoved mover]]. Therefore, wonder is what makes the mind rest. In some way, it does what [[thoughts/meditation]] does but in a more natural and spontaneous manner, unlike meditation that requires discipline.\n\nBugbee ends his entry by connecting wonder with what he calls the \"openness on the part of a person in his entirety.\" He says that if wonder should be treated not just a prompt for reflection but also as a source of fundamental truth, a notion he introduced in [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-08-29]], it has to involve this openness.\n\nThis openness is more than openness of the mind for it occurs spontaneously. Although Bugbee is not very explicit about what this openness is, he does compares it with the words \"rigidity,\" \"contraction,\" and \"deadness of spirit,\" words easily associated with [[Analytic philosophy]]. This helps us understand that, perhaps, what Bugbee refers to as openness is openness to one's choice of form and disposition when philosophizing. Bugbee wants the philospher to be free, to let wonder captivate him and let it lead him to where it needs to go. He confidently suggests that if this openness is a prerequisite to philosophical truth, then failure to embody it in one's philosophizing should be considered equivalent to committing logical contradictions.\n\n# References\n\nBugbee, H.

    "content": "\nIn his September 5 entry, [[thoughts/henry bugbee]] demonstrates perhaps one of his cryptic writings, an illustration of why he can be difficult to read. Bugbee interestingly connects [[thoughts/wonder]][^1] with [[Certainty]][^2]. Presence, which makes wonder possible bears fruit into certainty. But then he introduces a new concept: [[Experience]]. He said that knowing that wonder leads to certainty \"must be continuous with the experience in which it is confirmed.\" In other words, an experience leads to wonder, which leads to certainy. This thread should be established. Seen this way, experience can be used as a \"proving ground of philosophic thought.\" How? He introduces another concept: the [[Day]]. He calls a day \"the place of meeting with the lives of persons, yes, even with one's own life.\" Combine a series of days and you can give birth to philosophic thought. This reminds me of what I am already doing with [[Uman]]. I write [[Daily review]] reports then consolidate them at the end of the month (interestingly, that is exactly what I am about to do this morning).\n\nBugbee raises a new criticism to [[Analytic philosophy]], which removes intimacy of experience to theorize about them. He says that most philosophers \"think of experience in the image of objects.\" But this is not how we should look at experience. \"Experience is a tissue of meaning,\" Bugbee says. What most philosophers do is use past experiences to create statements about objects. In doing so, the assumption is that experience is a possession of the mind. We accumulate it and use it when needed. But experience according to Bugbee is a tissue of meaning to be understood \"not from behind but before our attention.\" Experience is not an object that we observe objectively. \"Experience is our underdoing, our involvement in the world, our lending or witholding of ourselves.\" Bugbee's understanding of [[thoughts/meaning]] seems to go against mine. I understood fairly recently that writing about my experience is a way to create more meaning about it. Doing it this way, am I treating my experience as a possession, an object of study? Bugbee says, we do this thinking that we can be masters of our lives. Am I guilty of this? \"We are not masters of the import of our deeds,\" Bugbee says. Meaning, Bugbee seems to suggest, must be created simultaneously with the experience. We realize or gail to realize meaning as the experience is ongoing. He says that we desire to objectify experience so we can uncover and implement empirical knowledge and techniques. We want to predict and control. If Bugbee believes in [[Moral realism]], then this statment makes sense: the experiences themselves, not us, brings with them their meaning. I disagree with this.\n\nI am also confused. Despite suggesting that an experience's meaning is created simultaneously with it, Bugbee also says \"we understand our experience at our own time.\" So is meaning different from understanding? This part of Bugbee's entry isn't clear to me.\n\n# References\n\nBugbee, H. (1999). _The Inward Morning: A Philosophical Exploration in Journal Form_.

    "content": "\nIn his September 23 entry, [[thoughts/henry bugbee]] begins his explanation of the two concepts her claimed to have illustrated in his previous entry[^1]: immersion and commitment. Bugbee defines immersion as \"living in the present with complete absorption.\" This absorption he says is not the \"congeal attention,\" wich one might experience in zen meditation, where one focuses on one's breathing.\n\nThe \"present\" where absorption happens is not \"a discrete moment in a series\"; it expands \"extensively into temporal and spatial distances.\" This is definitely not the present that I have been familiar with in zen. It is not the \"here, now\" if it transcends it. Does Bugbee mean that the mind is absorbed into wandering? Into mental excursions? Into walks? And that the time and space covered by such mental walks is what he refers to as \"present\"?\n\nDuring immersion, Bugbee explains that one perceives everything \"in alignment with a center.\" One moves from this center to greet everything. When one moves from thing to thing, they exhibit \"sameness as continuing of meaning.\" This seems to be related to what Bugbee calls \"universal meaning.\"\n\nBugbee then proceeds by dropping a quote, which I find baffling but which I cannot fully grasp for now:\n\n\u003eMetaphysical thinking must rise with the earliest dawn, the very dawn of things themselves. And this is the dawn in which basic action, too, comes into being. It is earlier than the day of morality and immorality.\n\nAlthough not fully clear to me, Bugbee seems to establish a close connection between metaphysics (thinking about things) and basic actions. Both of them, he seems to suggest, are more funndamental than ethical talk. He proceeds by talking about commitment. We are used to thinkigng that all actions have a reason behind them. However, Bugbee seems to suggest that reason is not always necessary for actions. He introduced the concept of \"true affirmation.\" He says that we are able to commit to actions without always articulating our reasons. Sometimes, the most important action we take eludes \"discursive articulation.\" We can manifest responsibility even \"in depth,\" even without words.\n\nBugbee does not support a complete rejection of the articulation of goals and reasons for acting. He simply wants us to be cautious in using them. Commitment in depth happens when one acts \"consciously with the felt universe\" and when universal meaning is collapsed in actions. In such cases, the action itself does the explanation.\n\n# References\n\nBugbee, H. (1999). _The Inward Morning: A Philosophical Exploration in Journal Form_.

    "content": "\n[[thoughts/henry bugbee]] starts talking about [[Ethics]]. At this time, he was teaching a course in ethics and this preoccuppied his thinking until October 18, 1952 in his journal. Bugbee claims that ethical inquiry (define) is difficult. This difficulty is due to an issue central to ethical reflection (define). The issue is how can we understand attitudes during ethical reflection or the situation that moves us to action? Usually, when faced with situations requiring action, we summon knowledge we possess to use to inform our action. Bugbee asks whether we do the same thing to the pursuit of the meaning of life. When we inquire about human well-being, can we summon the experience to help us answer our inquiry? If such experience is immediately acessible, shouldn we not use it to ensure our own well-being?\n\nBugbee proposes that two questions come together:\n- What are the conditions of our acting as we ought?\n- How is it possible to establish intimacy with these conditions in our concern to understand them reflectively?\n\nSince justified action does not occur by following correct procedures, we cannot understand it by following a proper method of inquiry. Bugbee argues that we cannot treat them like objects and think about them as such. He calls them meta-technical and meta-objective.\n\nHere, I am exposed to the difficulties that preoccupy those who adhere to [[Moral realism]] like Bugbee. In [[Error theory]], what Bugbee describes is a component of what makes the claimed metaphysical status of morality \"weird.\" If they resist representation and control and they are different from what our minds typically comprehend, do we even have access to them? I am perhaps getting ahead of myself, but I have a gut feel that this is when I'll eventually end up in commenting on what Bugbee will be talking about in the upcoming days.\n\n# References",

    "content": "\nAs I read this entry and recall my readings of [[thoughts/edward mooney]]'s blog and books, I notice a similarity. This [[thoughts/lyrical philosophy]] is writing beautifully about things these philosophers are reading—books, ideas written by their heroes. [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]] would be apalled! (See [[Words written outdoors vs indoors]].) But why can't we do both—a philosophical life that consists of reading a lot and writing about what onne reads and writing outdoors to open oneself to direct revelation?\n\nIn this entry, [[thoughts/henry bugbee]] directly responds to [[Gabriel Marcel]]. He returns to the subject of [[Faith]].[^1] He begins by stating that faith (i.e., openness or trustingness) is as important in ethical reflection as in action. Philosophical truth, he claims, arrives to the present from the past via reflection. But this arrival requires faith on the possibility of realization because philosophical truth, the meaning of one's past experiences, comes involuntarily like insight ([[Insight cannot be predetermined]]). We do not control its arrival artificially. We can only wait and trust (i.e., have faith) that it will arrive.\n\nWe become more open to its arrival if we keep ourselves in our \"true mode of being,\" which resides in the present moment.[^2] The more present we are, the more chance of recollection and the better our odds of capturing meaning. The arrival of such meaning—what is essential in our lives—come when we have already given up, surrendered, and have returned to our normal routines. It is in the middle of mundane life when the most essential realizations arrive, unanticipated and involuntary. Interestingly, when we recollect the meaning of past experiences, we also realize our deepest reality—that of being an existent  in the present moment. In his entry, Bugbee repeatedly mentions Marcel, in conversation with him, reacting to his texts. It is the same thing I find in Mooney.\n\n# References\n\n[^1]: [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-08-27]]\n[^2]: [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-08-28]]",

    "content": "\nIn September 28, [[thoughts/henry bugbee]] writes what is probably his most difficult to comprehend entry so far. It is an entry about the possibility of using belief (or [[Faith]])[^1] as a tool for understanding. He first acknowledges that the statement \"believe in order to understand\" is unclear and invites dishonesty. The statement presupposes that we can believe on something we do not understand.\n\nBugbee proposes that to make sense of the statement, we must let go of our preoccupation of forms of knowledge and the methods of yielding them. Instead, we must shift our attention to the \"inner activity\" of the person yielding the knowledge. This consideration of the thinker's inner activity is something the West is devoid of, especially in disciplines like science and mathematics where the subject-matter is not experience but those abstracted from concrete experience. However, Bugbee suggests that when analyzing the epistemological basis of scientific and mathematical knowledge, the experience of the scientist or mathematician cannot be completely removed from the equation, otherwise, they are not revealing what they presupposed, suggesting they are believing to understand.\n\nBugbee then turns to the question of philosophy's subject matter. Philosophy seems to be strictly devoid of one, forcing it to have a parasitical status, borrowing subject-matters from other disciplines or becoming an arbitter or systematizer of methods and results produced by other disciplines with their own subject-matters. But philosophical reflection is bound with human experience, and experience is not susceptible to objective representation or control. To make sense of the statement \"believing to understand,\" one may need to let go of the supposition that believing is something we do to attain a result (understanding). Treating belief this way is objectionable because it seems to suggest that it has to be done for the sake of a result which is necessarily obscure. In Bugbee's words, \"Believing itself must be answerable to something more authoritative than someone's say-so if it is to be a condition of understanding.\" Bugbee warns us that if belief is a condition for understanding, we must not treat the connection as causal. Faith is not arbitrary. For Bugbee, it is abhorrent to agree with the idea that faith is favoring a set of beliefs that can neither be established nor disapproved because we have nothing to lose and everything to gain if they are true (by belief) and if we believe them to be true even if they are not.\n\nFor faith to be a condition for understanding, it must be as authentic and non-arbitrary as the understanding it yields. \"Faith cannot be recommended; it can only be called upon.\" In conclusion, Bugbee suggests that the nature of faith can be clarified by thinking throug the idea of responsibility.\n\n[[2022-10-12 seeds]]: Now I get what bugbee is saying. You can't use faith for a practical purpose. You arrive into it. You cant recommend it. Its like when you arrived at the unmoving mover. Faith is the end. You can no longer use reason. But there is nothing beyond faith. There is no understanding after it. Faith is the end.\n\n# References\n\n[^1]: [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-08-28]]",

He mentioned there that the realization of what is essential to us comes unexpectedly in the middle of our normal routines.\n\nBugbee extends his discussion of this concept by saying that we cannot determine what its most essential to our lives without facing a few other problems. The most important of these problems is universality. Bugbee makes the case that what is essential for one human being may not be what is essential to another.\n\nBugbee recognizes that every individual can attain insight on what could be essential to them. This ability, however, opens up the possibility of sympathy. Since we can have access to what is essential to us, we could appreciate another person who has a similar essential.\n\nHowever, Bugbee points out that we can sympathize with a person without standing by them. That said, the more that which is essential to another person is \"focalized\" in our experience, the more we commit to stand by them. This focalization becomes possible by concentrating on our communion with others.\n\nAll of these can only happen if we find a real reason for communing with others. Bugbee raises the issue that the basis for communing with others should be universal.\n\nBugbee then turns his attention to [[Imannuel Kant]], whose ethical theory he criticizes as not grasping the connection of individuality with universality. In responding to Kant, Bugbee claims that the relevance of universality to action can only be determined through a clear understanding of individuality. For him, \"we are only truly individual in so far as we are able to acknowledge and act upon a universal significance in our lives.\" We understand such universal significance in our individual way. This makes us irreplaceable. The universal may bind all of us, but our expression of it is what makes us unique.\n\nThis reminds me of [[Scott Barry Kaufman]] and [[Transcend — Kaufman]]. [[Maslow’s heirarchy of needs]] has a claim to universality. Transcendence happens anywhere. Self-actualization happens everywhere. But each of us self-actualize and transcend in our own unique ways.\n\nAfter discussing this, Bugbee returns yet again to the subject of [[Faith]].[^2] He says, \"the believing conditional to basic understanding is a matter of response to the intimations we receive of an absolute stake in life.\" I currently have a difficulty understanding what he means here.\n\n# References\n\n[^1]: [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-09-27]]\n[^2]: [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-08-27]]",

    "content": "\nOn October 2, [[thoughts/henry bugbee]] began an intellectual excursion on [[Socrates]], which continued until October 10, 1952. Bugbee begins by the claim that focusing on Socrates' contributions on induction could cloud the real force of his thought. According to Bugbee, Socrates was primarily concerned with an \"examined life.\" In this examination, man was the focus and self-knowledge was the goal. A pursuit of knowledge outside of man should serve the pursuit of understanding oneself. Socrates was never after a system of thought. Bugbee argues that Socrates' questions and themes led us back to ourselves and our capacity for reflection. His own life was the testimony to all these.\n\nBugbee then shifts by thinking about one of the themes that Socrates brought up: the examined life and is value. Any man, whether his vocation is intellectual or manual, should claim that a life worth living involves his vocation. A life worth living must include a vocation no matter what it is.\n\nOne's choice of vocation depends on one's view of what is essential to himself.[^1] Is the examination of life what is essential to all? For Socrates, it is, because of two reasons. First, man needs knowledge to excel. Second, man consciously avoids the worse course.\n\nSocrates' conception of the examined life and how much we agree with it, Bugbee claims, are great guiding issues for ethical reflection. This actually reminds me of something I wrote in the past: [[An unexamined life can still be a good life]]. We can continue living without answering the deepest questions. And even so, we can say that that life was a good life. But I also remember something [[contacts/rem tanauan]] mentioned a while back. He argued that we were created with creative abilities, therefore, we need to be capitalizing on these abilities and getting out there. The same thing can be said with our intellectual abilities. We were gifted with these. Making the most of them would mean that we are living a life as full as possible. It also means we are capable of deepening and increasing the meaning of our own lives.\n\n# References\n\n[^1]: [[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-09-29]]",

This was a new habit I was building, and I thought it was bad to miss two days in a row. I wasn’t able to do it yesterday because I slept at Kuya Al and Ate Sarah’s place. She was there too.\n\nI wanted to start taking care more of my body. So I have to do this. But I regret not going back to sleep. I should’ve gotten back.\n\nThere was nothing unusual with this morning. I stood up and switched the lights on, illuminating the windowless room, which was terribly dark just a second ago. My notebook, the daily devotional, and the Bible all piled together gleamed on top of the Monobloc that I used as a table when I’m sitting on my bed.\n\nI kept the pants that I was already wearing when I slept and just put on my blue sweater. It was one of those sweaters that has a zipper that ran only from the neck to the chest. It has no pockets and it was collared like a polo shirt.\n\nI walked out of the room and closed it. My sister was still sleeping in the other room across the dining table and the vacant space that was supposed to be the living room. Behind the curtains, tiny white and yellow lights flickered. They were from the fields that grew flowers over the hills of Ambiong. They were the only lights outside, aside from the few street lights here and there. The sun won’t show up until about another 30 minutes.\n\nI wasn’t particularly noisy, but I wasn’t careful either. I started putting on my rubber shoes. When I was finished, I opened the wooden door then the steel and screened door behind it. It’s weird, but those two doors separated me from what will be an entirely different life.\n\nAn unusual change of air came to me as I started walking the steep road that led to the main road. From afar, the main road was still very silent except one or two jeepneys that were already starting their day. Upon reaching the main road, the path started to go downhill. I walked down the road, crossed the street, then stood in front of the opened gate of the enclosed hill that they call Bayan Park.\n\nI climbed up the hill then started jogging. I was alone. The air was still cold. A few weeks from now, Baguio’s temperature will start going up. But today, the cold that filled all our Decembers was still here. It was so difficult to break a sweat.\n\nJust a few minutes of doing this and I stopped.\n\nI should feel good, but I didn’t.\n\nI started walking slowly.\n\nI can still hear her words. I can still hear my words. I can still feel the pain of realizing how young I was, how vulnerable to the weaknesses of the soul. I wasn’t aware until then that I was absorbed in my own thoughts the entire time I was walking and jogging. I knew I should be sad, and I thought I was sad. What I didn’t know then was that it wasn’t sadness that I was starting to feel.\n\nIt was something more.\n\nSomething that could last for weeks, months, years.\n\nThe only thing I knew then was that it was unusually dark. The sun wasn’t around. It won’t come until about 30 more minutes. And it was cold. Too cold. The beginning of a long, long cold.",

    "content": "\n![Sunset on a beach at Ilocos](sunset_beach_ilocos.jpg)\n\nThe main thesis of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), an established method used to treat mental and emotional problems, is that there are two realities: (1) what exists out there (fact) and (2) what exists in a person's mind.\n\nCBT argues that what often occurs in the mind of a person suffering from a mental issue is a distortion of factual events happening in his life. This distortion is created by his mind's skewed interpretation of reality.\n\nSay, his friend went pass him without saying \"hi.\" He'll interpret this as \"My friend ignored me because I'm too insignificant\" when the fact is that his friend was running to a job interview and so was preoccupied.\n\nDistorted, almost automatic, interpretation of reality produces negative emotions and a conscious correction of one's thought patterns, which CBT does, alleviates the suffering.\n\nI find a resemblance between CBT's main thesis and what I see is true with what exists in the world.\n\nThere are things that exist independent of our minds and a truth statement about them are \"facts.\"\n\nOn the other hand, there is another level of reality which is entirely dependent on our minds - thoughts, emotions, interpretations, experiences. A truth statement based on one's emotions and interpretations are \"values.\"\n\nIn the search for meaning and truth, a meaningful distinction between these two has to be recognized. Not everything that is different is bad. They are just what they are.\n\nMuch like depression or psychosis, a distortion of truth happens when we let our values meddle or dictate how we see \"facts.\" Facts are discovered by logic alone.\n\nWe might be motivated by values in our search for facts but that's just it. They motivate us but they are not tools to uncover facts.\n\nWorking on values is a completely different ball game, simply because it has a different form of existence.\n\nThis is just how things are. And not respecting their nature leads to a life soaked in lies.\n",

    "content": "\nstrong discipline is required to avoid the easiest, most comfortable narrative, and to reconcile in my writing competing visions of the “good society.”\n\nOnly a quiet mind can remain intellectually humble. Intellectual humility involves recognizing the limits of ideas and drawing on multiple perspective. This can only be done if we turn off the noise and find ways to listen to ourselves.\n\nTo encourage better introspection, you can try the following:\n\n- minimize social media use\n- minimize screen time\n- read mostly on print\n- dedicate portions of your day to introspection and contemplation\n\nIntellectual problems especially those that engage with social problems require constant updating of assumptions and beliefs. This updating can only be done through contemplation and engagement with different voices—not advocacy.\n\nWe need to resist the urge to quickly choose between two opposing stands. Quickly choosing between two perspectives is easy but not the best approach. A better approach is to:\n\n- spend more time wrestling on the tensions and uncertainties of the opposing perspectives.\n- look for something in both perspectives that offers something valuable\n- Embrace uncertainty, because certainty breeds pride. When one is certain, one stops listening to others. When one is certain, one stops to doubt, stops to grow. Certainty is okay and understandable only if there was enough thinking done to evaluate ideas.\n- aspire for moderation, pragmatism, and skepticism that is only possible through deep reading and contemplation\n\nTo really contemplate well, avoid spending hours looking and responding to other people’s thoughts.\n\nSocial media platforms AI are designed to feed us with content that simply reflects our existing biases rather than content that challenge them.\n\nWhen a major event occurs, our first thought about it is not our own idea but the opinion of a popular commenter or group that appeals to our worse biases. Matthew Nisbet calls this the “social media outrage machine”. This, he said, is the reason why we can’t think independently and discuss productively with people who have a different opinion from ours.\n\nUsing fear can draw people’s attention to a particular issue, but it leaves them powerless and in denial, and so they don’t take real action.\n\nDiscourses among opposite views are often reduced into a Manichean storyline where good fights evil. This demonization of the other prevents what Nisbet hopes to happen—drawing best ideas from all factions (center-right, center-left, and left). This is particularly the tendency of progressives. Progressives see a problem as a battle to prevent disaster and transform the world into their version of an ideal society.\n\nNormally, we should be able to rely on news organizations and journalists to scrutinize bad thinking and political maneuvering among opposing sides of an issue. This is increasingly impossible as media organizations and journalists take sides and even help a specific advocacy.\n\nActivists, academics, and journalists protect their narratives vehemently that they discredit experts who question these narratives as deniers, delayers, contrarians, confusionists, lukewarmers, inactivists, and non-solutionists. (Source: [https://issues.org/the-science-police/](https://issues.org/the-science-police/)). The purpose of this strategy is to control who has the authority on a particular subject. The use of these labels cultivates a discourse culture where tribalism is more important than \"constructive consideration of knowledge and evidence.”\n\nOnline immersion is the death of the moderate-minded intellectual. It disrupts our ability to think critically and empathize with others. Nicholas Carr argued that when screen-based text with images and video replaced linear printed books, concentration, disciplined thought, and deeper understanding was replaced by skimming, multitasking, superficial thinking, and short-term memory. Being used to the Internet made reading deeply more difficult.\n\n[Reader, Come Home: The Reading Brain in a Digital World](https://www.amazon.com/Reader-Come-Home-Reading-Digital/dp/0062388789)\n\n[Andrew Sullivan: My Distraction Sickness — and Yours](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/09/andrew-sullivan-my-distraction-sickness-and-yours.html)\n\nWhat can you do to minimize the time you spend online?\n\n- Log on Twitter or Facebook only with a very specific intention and purpose.\n- Pare down your list of friends.\n- Social media is a battle we are all losing. Deleting your accounts in social media might be the best thing to do.\n- Shift your reading back to print.\n- Plan several hours of solitude.\n- Write using pen and paper.\n\nMatt’s process\n\n- Reads and takes note.\n- Takes a break to walk or practice yoga.\n\n—\n\nWe cannot come up with a picture of a “good society” without first describing what a “good individual” is.\n\n## References\n\n",

    "title": "The One Thing — Keller and Papasan (Book Summary)",
    "content": "\nIn _The One Thing_, Gary Keller and Jay Papasan explore how the Pareto principle could be applied in the accomplishment of tasks. Their main thesis is this: identify the most important thing (\"the ONE THING\") in your life in general and in every specific area of your life and put your best efforts into that.\n\n### Chapter One: The One Thing\n\n**Main point: What's the ONE THING you can do this week such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?**\n\n### Chapter Two: The Domino Effect\n\n**Main point: Extraordinary success is built sequentially, one thing at a time, not simultaneously.**\n\nDo the following every day:\n\n1. Every day, line up your priorities anew.\n2. Find your most important domino.\n3. Whack away at it until it falls.\n\n### Chapter Three: Success Leaves Clues\n\n**Main point: While you may have many passions and skills, what is that one passion or skill that gives you an intense emotion, that defines you, or drives you more than anything else? Focus on that.**\n\n## Part 1: The Lies\n\n6 Lies\n\n1. Everything matters equally\n2. Multitasking\n3. A disciplined life\n4. Willpower is always on will-call\n5. A balanced life\n6. Big is bad\n\n### Chapter Four: Everything Matters Equally\n\n**Main point: Prioritize your most important tasks every day and every time you need to do so.**\n\n- Instead of a To-Do List, use a Success List—a list that is purposefully created around extraordinary results.\n- Extraordinary results are disproportionately created by fewer actions than most realize.\n\nExtreme Pareto\n\n1. Start with a large list.\n2. Whittle your way from there to the critical few.\n3. Do not stop until you end with the essential ONE.\n\n### Chapter Five: Multitasking\n\n**Main point: When doing your most important work, don't multitask.**\n\nThe costs of juggling:\n\n- It takes some time to start a new task.\n- It takes some time to restart a task you quit.\n- There’s no guarantee that you’ll ever pick up exactly where you left off.\n\n### Chapter Six: A Disciplined Life\n\n**Main point: Discipline is just a habit. Choose a habit and establish it with a little discipline until it gets easier.**\n\nHow to form habits\n\n1. Choose one habit.\n2. Stick to it long enough to be a habit.\n3. Watch how it becomes easier.\n4. Do the most important thing and all others become easier.\n5. Build on the newly established habit or build another one.\n\n### Chapter Seven: Willpower is Always on Will-Call\n\n**Main point: Do your most important tasks at the time of the day when your willpower is high.**\n\nHow to manage willpower\n\n- Reserve it for the things that matter most.\n- Replenish it when it's low.\n- Eat right and regularly.\n\n### Chapter Eight: A Balanced Life\n\n**Main point: Be clear about your priority at work so you can get it done. Then be clear about your priorities in other areas of your life so you can get them done and go back to work.**\n\n- Extraordinary results require focused attention and time. Time on one thing means time away from another.\n- Magic never happens in the middle; magic happens at the extremes.\n- Instead of balancing, use counterbalancing\n\nHow to counterbalance your work and life\n\n- Accept that you will have to spend more time at one to achieve extraordinary results.\n- But don't spend too much time on one that there is nothing waiting for you on the other when you return.\n- Separate your work life and personal life into two distinct buckets. Then within each bucket, also use counterbalancing to manage various goals and responsibilities.\n\n### Chapter Nine: Big is Bad\n\nMain point: Thinking big is good because it frees you to ask different questions, follow different paths, and try new things.\n\n- The only actions that become springboards to succeeding big are those informedly big thinking to begin with.\n- Think as big as you possibly can and base what you do, how you do it, and who you do it with on succeeding at that level.\n- As we approach Big, we realize that things are easier than we imagine.\n- The journey to achieving big makes you bigger.\n\n## Part Two: The Truth\n\n- The key to success isn’t in all the things we do but in the handful of things we do well.\n- Success comes down to this: being appropriate in the moments of your life.\n- Success is being able to say: \"This is where I’m meant to be right now, doing exactly what I’m doing.\"\n\n### Chapter Ten: The Focusing Question\n\n**Main point: \"What's the ONE THING I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?\" This is the focusing question. Use it all the time****.**\n\n- The first step is important, and the focusing question helps keep the first step from being a misstep.\n- The focusing question is both a map for the big picture and a compass for the smallest next move.\n- Using the focusing question, you’re setting yourself up to accomplish one task on top of another.\n\n### Chapter Eleven: The Success Habit\n\n**Main point: Use the Focusing Question as a habit when starting your day and when finding what matters most in your life areas.**\n\n- Continue to ask the question until you can see the connection and all your dominoes are lined up.\n\nHow to use the focusing question in your life areas\n\n1. Arrange your life areas according to priority.\n2. Find what matters most in each area (the ONE THING) and focus on doing them. View them as the cornerstones that when done makes everything else easier.\n3. Reframe the question by inserting your area of focus.\n4. You can also include a time frame like “right now” or “this year” to give your answer the appropriate level of immediacy.\n5. You can also include a time frame like “in five years” or “someday” to find a big-picture answer that points you at outcomes to aim for.\n6. Say the category first, then state the question, add a time frame, and end by adding “such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?\n\n### Chapter Twelve: The Path to Great Answers\n\n**Main point: For extraordinary results, (1) ask a great question and (2) seek out a great answer.**\n\nHow to ask a great question\n\n1. Ask a question that is big enough that it pushes you and stretches you.\n2. Ask a question that aims towards a specific answer.\n3. To make a big, specific question even more powerful, convert it to the focusing question. This forces you to identify what absolutely matters most and start there.\n\nHow to find a great answer\n\n1. Benchmark. Uncover the best research and study the highest achievers. Search for clues and role models to point you in the right direction.\n2. Trend. Use your benchmark as your minimum, a launchpad to see what might come next in the same direction as the best performers or in an entirely new direction.\n\n## Part Three: Extraordinary Results\n\nThe three elements in implementing the ONE THING\n\n1. Purpose\n2. Priority\n3. Productivity\n\n- Use your purpose as a guiding force in determining the priority that drives your actions.\n- The more productive people become the more purpose and priority push and drive them.\n- Profit, the result of productivity, is also driven by purpose and priority.\n\n### Chapter Thirteen: Live With Purpose\n\n**Main point: Who we are and where we want to go (purpose) determine what we do (priority) and what we accomplish (productivity).**\n\n- No matter our motivations, most of what we do in life is ultimately meant to make us happy.\n- Becoming more engaged in what we do by finding ways to make our life more meaningful is the surest way of finding lasting happiness.\n- Know what matters to you then take daily doses of actions in alignment with it.\n- To find your purpose, ask: \"What’s the ONE THING I can do in my life that would mean the most to me and the world, such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?\"\n\n### Chapter Fourteen: Live By Priority\n\nMain point: Set your present priority based on your future priority.\n\n- Purpose without priority is powerless.\n- Priority, not priorities.\n- We have goals and plans for only one reason—to be appropriate in the moments of our lives that matter.\n- Your priority in the now determines your present now and future now.\n\nHow to do goal setting for the Now\n\n1. Set a future goal.\n2. Methodically drill down to what you should be doing right now.\n3. Rest your ONE THING right now to your ONE THING today.\n4. Rest your ONE THING today to your ONE THING this week.\n5. Rest your ONE THING this week to your ONE THING this month.\n6. Connect today to all your tomorrows.\n7. Write down your answers.\n\n### Chapter Fifteen: Live for Productivity\n\n**Main point: Block time for your ONE THING. Then protect that time block.**\n\n- For onetime ONE THING, block off the appropriate hours and days.\n- For habits, block off the appropriate time every day.\n- If your ONE THING creates disproportionate results, then give it disproportionate time.\n- Put up a sheet of paper that said, “Until My ONE Thing Is Done—Everything Else Is A Distraction!”\n\nHow to time block effectively\n\n1. Time block your time off (vacation).\n2. Time block your ONE THING.\n3. Time block your planning time.\n\nTime block your time off.\n\n- See yourself as working between vacations.\n- Manage your work time around your downtime.\n\nTime block your ONE THING.\n\n- Design your days around your one thing.\n- Block 4 hours a day (minimum, if you can do more, do it).\n- Be a maker in the morning and a manager in the afternoon.\n\nTime block your planning time.\n\n- Reflect on where you are and where you want to go.\n- Do this annually and weekly.\n\n### Chapter Sixteen: The Three Commitments\n\n**Main point: Commit to (1) adopting the mindset of someone seeking mastery, (2) continually seeking the very best ways of doing things, and (3) doing everything you can to achieve your ONE THING.**\n\nAdopt the mindset of someone seeking mastery.\n\n- Mastering the right thing will make everything else you do easier or no longer necessary.\n- Give the best you have to become the best you can be at your most important work.\n- Be a master of what you know, apprentice of what you don’t.\n\nContinually seek the very best ways of doing things.\n\n- Look for new models and systems of doing things.\n- Use the Focusing Question to narrow your choices down to the next thing you should do.\n\nLive the accountability cycle.\n\n- Accountability is the most important of the three commitments.\n- Look at outcomes as the information you can use to frame better actions to get better outcomes.\n- Sharing your progress towards your goals with someone regularly makes you almost twice as effective.\n\n### Chapter Seventeen: The Four Thieves\n\nMain point: Avoid the Four Thieves.\n\nThe four thieves\n\n1. Inability to say NO\n2. Fear of chaos\n3. Poor health habits\n4. The environment doesn’t support your goals\n\nInability to say NO\n\n- The way to protect what you’ve said yes to and stay productive is to say no to anyone or anything that could derail you.\n- When you say yes to something, it’s imperative that you understand what you’re saying no to.\n- Practice the Three-Foot Rule: A request must be connected to my ONE Thing for me to consider it. If not, then I either say no to it or use any of the approaches I shared above to deflect it elsewhere.\n\nFear of chaos\n\n- Accept that when you focus on your ONE THING, chaos will accumulate around you. Don't fight this.\n- Trust that your work on your ONE THING will help you manage the chaos later on.\n\nPoor health habits\n\n- High achievement and extraordinary results require big energy. The trick is learning how to get it and keep it.\n- Focus on having an energized start to each day. Starting each day this way makes the rest of the day easier.\n\nThe environment doesn’t support your goals\n\n- Environment = who you see + what you experience every day\n- The people surrounding you and the physical environment surrounding you must support your goals.\n\n### Chapter Eighteen: The Journey\n\n**Main point: Live a life of no regrets by putting your ONE THING at the top of your mind and at the top of your schedule.**\n\n- At any moment in time, there can be only ONE THING, and when that ONE THING is in line with your purpose and sits atop your priorities, it will be the most productive thing you can do.\n\nHow to go small to get big\n\n1. Survey your choices.\n2. Narrow your options.\n3. Line up your priorities.\n4. Do what matters most.\n5. Go small by finding your ONE THING.\n",

    "title": "The Philosophy of Spirituality",
    "content": "\nRobert Fuller generalizes that those who claim to be spiritual believe in a Higher Power and aspire to “enter into a more intense relationship with this Higher Power”. However, including a Higher Power in understanding spirituality is not necessary.\n\nReference\n\nFuller, RC. 2001. Spiritual but not religious: Understanding unchurched Amarica. New York: Oxford University Press, 7.\n\n---\n\nHow do we judge that a certain practice is indeed a spiritual practice?\n\nWe interview subjects and then accurately reflect on their characterizations of the practice.\n\nWe need a neutral taxonomy to process what subjects say about them and their practice.\n\n---\n\n**Evaluating certain practices as spiritual seems to be problematic since many of these practices can be simply described as aesthetic, ethical, physical, or psychological practices.**\n\n---\n\nWade Clark Roof offers an interesting understanding of what spirituality is. Spirituality is simply the process through which individuals tap into a diverse “spiritual marketplace” and choose certain practices that they customize for their own life to create an “inner feeling” that lifts and moves them.\n\nReferences\n\nRoof, WC. 1999. Spiritual marketplace: Baby boomers and the remaking of American religion. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 137.\n\n---\n\nTaylor argues two important claims:\n\n1. Spiritual problems are distinguishable from ethical problems.\n2. Spirituality is normatively contained by religion.\n\nThe first claim encourages the development of a philosophy of spirituality. The second claim encourages an examination of spirituality independent of religion.\n\nReferences\n\nTaylor, CT. 2007. A secular age. Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press.\n\n---\n\n**Taylor argues that all cultures have a conception of “human flourishing”. However, many of them offer another thing: an indespensable element that is independent of human flourishing.**\n\n**This indespensable element is related to transcendence. Transcendence can be theoretically articulated in different ways. But many religious and spiritual seekers agree that transcendent experiences are moments when the aspiration to a truly flourishing life is achieved.**\n\n---\n\nThere might be a need for spirituality if Mark Johnston is correct when he said that, “there are certain large-scale structural defects in human life that no amount of psychological adjustment or practical success can free us from.”\n\nReferences\n\nJohnston, M. 2011. Saving God: Religion after idolatry. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University.\n\n---\n\nAn argument against the necessity of spiritual or religious attributes\n\nThis is the line of thinking of Nicholls and Salazar:\n\nLarge-scale structural defects exist.\n\nIf these defects can be addressed by the most robust for of ethics, then there is no need to speak about spiritual or religous attributes.\n\nAristotle’s argument:\n\nAristotle argued that the best and most complete form of human life is a life that has achieved eudaimonia. However, even a person who has achieved eudaimonia is not immune to misfortune. At first glance, this could mean that eudaimonia seems to not be the final completion. However, Aristotle posits that once a person has achieved eudaimonia, it is impossible for him to be dettered of misfortune as he is able to integrate the misfortune into his wisdom and continue living.\n\nIf this main problem is easily solved this way, then there is no need for spiritual or religious attributes. However, if indeed responding to misfortune and the large-scale structural defects is a problem that is distinctively spiritual, then spirituality and flourishing should not be put together on one conceptual space.\n\n---\n\nTaylor argues that the spirituality of Buddha and Jesus consisted of a radical change of identity that does not negate eudamonia or flourishing but makes a profound inner break from its goals.\n\n---\n\nWhat is preventing spirituality from being taken seriously:\n\n- Its vocabulary intersects with the core concepts of religion and ethics.\n- Its vocabularly further intersects with aesthetics, science, and the like.\n- The populist tendency to constantly expand its conceptual reach without proposing normative limiting criteria\n\n---\n\nChapter 1\n\nUnderstanding Spirituality\n\nHeather Salazar and Roderick Nicholls\n\n# References\n\nSalazar, H., \u0026 Nicholls, R.

  "/The-Rise-of-the-Full-Stack-Freelancer-by-Tiago-Forte": {
    "title": "The Rise of the Full-Stack Freelancer by Tiago Forte",
    "content": "\nFull-Stack Freelancers respond to technology as an opportunity, not a threat. They leverage software-as-a-service and online platforms to vertically integrate a “full stack” of capabilities, instead of focusing on one narrow function. This allows them to capture a much greater percentage of the value they create, instead of giving it away to gatekeepers and distribution bottlenecks.\n\nFull-Stack Freelancers are responding to a series of technology-driven trends — contingent employment, intensifying globalization, and automation — by taking advantage of the other side of the coin: technology finally becoming powerful enough, cheap enough, and user-friendly enough to be deployed productively by a single individual.\n\nThey borrow freely — from tech startups, digital nomads, lifestyle designers, independent contractors, the sharing and peer-to-peer economies\n\nFull-Stack Freelancers manage a _portfolio of income streams_, not a _job based on one set of skills_.\n\nThese potentially include both products and services, online and offline businesses, digital and physical products, active and passive income sources, in-person and remote interaction, individual contribution and group collaboration, and offerings that are low margin and high margin, mass-produced and customizable, high risk and low risk, monetized directly or indirectly, short-term and long-term, or any combination of the above.\n\nit requires a skill that virtually none of us are educated for: _portfolio thinking._\n\n[In reference to \"deep work\"] If, on the other hand, you want to be a manager, run a business, develop side projects, or collaborate with others, it is terrible advice. It gives you no portfolio to work with.\n\nPortfolio thinking recognizes that having multiple parallel projects provides many opportunities for synergy. They don’t have to interfere with and impede each other — they can actually combine into something greater than the sum of its parts. Each one can make the others easier, more fun, and more profitable.\n\nMy freelancing business, Forte Labs, turned 4 years old this month, and I’ll use it as an example. My portfolio contains (in the order they were added) public workshops, self-paced online courses, corporate trainings, consulting on various topics, 1-on-1 performance coaching, and a membership subscription for my blog.\n\nthe great majority of my income comes from two sources, corporate trainings and online courses. They are both services — training and teaching — that I’ve productized using digital platforms, to make them more scalable and automated. They are, obviously, essential to my continued survival, as they allow me to make money semi-passively (in the case of online courses) and without having to start from scratch each time (in the case of corporate trainings).\n\nThe two sources that make up 81% of my income take up only 34% of my time. My third biggest source of income, consulting, produces 13% of revenue but takes up 24% of my time. And the least profitable sources — public workshops, membership subscriptions, coaching, and other — contribute 6% to the top line, but consume a whopping 42% of my time.\n\ntechnology helps me produce enough leverage for 3 days of the week, that I can invest 2 whole days in activities with no immediate return.\n\nPortfolio thinking takes advantage of the principle of **opportunistic addition**: there are many things you can spend time on that add value when done in moderation, but whose returns quickly diminish the more of it you do.\n\nI want to convince you that such opportunities are totally pervasive, low-hanging fruit available to anyone willing to diversify their portfolio.\n\nI’ve found that pure consulting is extremely difficult for me to do profitably. Starting each project with a new client and a blank slate means there are huge startup costs, long periods of exploration and experimentation with no corresponding compensation, and lingering projects that never quite seem to finish. Selling my time directly, it is too easy to get nickel-and-dimed with small asks. Not to mention the difficulty of bringing my very best creative thinking to the table every single day.\n\nBut when done in moderation, say once per quarter, consulting jobs are an incredible source of exploration and learning. The best, most original ideas simply can’t be found by reading blog posts and books. They are emerging from the chaotic process of conceiving, designing, producing, and selling real products in the real world. Getting access to this messy, but priceless learning requires some level of engagement with makers. If I can do that while being paid, all the better!\n\nThe same goes for coaching. If I had to make a full-time living as a performance coach, I’d have to lower my per-hour rate until my schedule was full, leaving me no time for other projects. But doing it only occasionally, it provides a valuable opportunity to look deep inside someone’s productivity systems.\n\nThe key is to understand that premium products and services, like corporate trainings and high-end online courses, require _long_ sales cycles. They are not something one buys on impulse. The customer has to know you, understand where you’re coming from, and trust you. This requires a rich, interactive process of reading your writing, watching your videos, seeing your social media posts, perusing your email newsletter, and trying out your more affordable offerings.\n\nAs a Full-Stack Freelancer, you have to _monetize this sales process yourself_. You can call it a “relationship builder sequence” if that makes you more comfortable. You can’t put in a ton of work upfront only hoping it will someday pay off. Some of what you put out should be free, of course. But the sooner you start charging, even if it’s $5, the faster you’ll start learning. The words of a paying customer are worth far more than a spectator’s.\n\nThe different ways you monetize and derive value from your sales process are the items in your portfolio:\n\nSocial media shares and free blog posts are your lead capture, bringing people into your audience. They also keep you exposed to the wider world beyond your niche.\n\nYour introductory offerings are your qualification and filtering system, helping you identify not only the people who are most committed to your message, but also the best ideas and formats to help carry that message.\n\nPremium offerings are the cash cows, allowing you to provide the most value with your time, and be compensated accordingly.\n\nWhat may not be immediately obvious is that the model above is not just a one-way funnel — it is a network. A given customer can follow multiple possible paths through my network of offerings. Each additional offering provides another entry point into the network, which increases the number and diversity of people I can serve.\n\nBut it isn’t just customers that traverse the network in all directions. Information and value do too.\n\nI often learn about a new topic or trend from a consulting job that fuels my writing for months, adding value to memberships. Facilitation skills learned in public workshops make me comfortable offering a live online bootcamp, combining the best of online and offline formats. Nearly every coaching client shows me a new tactic I’ve never thought of, which I can then package up and share in corporate trainings as real-world implementation advice. And of course, all sorts of “unpaid” activities suddenly become worthwhile when I know that every conversation is an opportunity to bring someone into my network, where I often can’t even predict the value they’ll contribute.\n\n**multifinality** — accomplishing multiple ends with a single means.\n\nSince my portfolio is a network, it exhibits **network effects**: each offering added increases the value of all the others.\n\nI build trust by interacting with them in different environments with different goals. This trust in turn makes it easier to launch new offerings, as more people are willing to give new products a chance.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling aspect of Full-Stack Freelancing is that it offers a middle ground, with potentially the best of both worlds. It is pragmatic, recognizing that most people are generalists who want to pursue diverse interests. But it is also aspirational, recognizing that you need the flexibility to take advantage of unexpected opportunities.\n\nA Full-Stack Freelancer does not see a black-and-white world of free agents vs. wage slaves. They are more than willing to incorporate full-time employment as one item in their portfolio, temporarily or long-term, knowing that it neither defines them nor limits them. Breaking down this barrier, we see that the full stack is available to everyone. It requires only a level of engagement with technology as producers, not just consumers. More fundamentally, it requires a willingness to grow your portfolio toward areas of uncertainty and discomfort, instead of only toward existing strengths.\n\nChanging direction is just a matter of adding or removing an item from your portfolio, not making a dramatic, wrenching career change.\n\n## References\n\nForte, T.

    "content": "I pressed the left brake to help me turn right. A single person was outside the house that sits beside the entry to the farm-to-market road—a young woman, probably in her 30s, just standing up in front of the house. Usually, there would be four or more gathered outside. But today, only dogs, some tied while others let loose, filled the sides of the road. I pressed on.\n\nIt was past six and the sun has already completed its descent. Only a glitter of orange marked its trail on the blue sky. From afar, I saw Tito Jess. While he held chalk and eraser two weeks ago, today, he holds dried grass and crumpled leaves between his hands. He dumps them on a pile. \"Tito Jess!\" I cried as I passed by. \"Vince!\" he replied. There was light to run after. So I pressed on.\n\nOn the final stretch of cement, before my bike wheels hit rocks and stones and dust, I saw the small girl again. Today, she is dragging the ropes of two goats, leading them out of the cement and down into the soil beside her family's house—the same soil her father probably tills and plants on for cash. She squatted, picked up the nearest rock, and hit the bamboo stick at the end of the first goat's rope down into the ground. She raised her head up when she was finished, saw me, and threw a smile. I reciprocated with a nod.\n\nI reached the small cemented house that keeps the motor that sucks water from the springs deep below the ground and pumps it out into the irrigation canals. There were three cows standing around the house: a mother, a little calf, and a bull. The adults were fastened, away from each other, while the little boy was let loose.\n\nThe little calf had a brown skin over his head. It looked like he was wearing a hat. As I sat down, he walked slowly away from his mother. At first, I thought he was walking towards me. But then he galloped towards the bull and started licking his horns. The bull stood still, head bowed down for the little calf to reach. He might be his father. Or I just hoped he was.\n\nA swarm of dark, winged creatures flew around me—too near one of them almost hit my face. They were bats circling around the irrigation canal below me and my bike. Perhaps, they spotted some prey. Perhaps, they're just annoyed that a bipedal was still around their turf at this hour. Whatever their reason, I decided to leave them in peace.\n\nI pulled my bike and dragged it beside me as I walked the road of rocks and stones and dust.\n",

Our greatest gift to children, concerning their education, is free time to discover and pursue their own interests.\n\n---\n\nOPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITH THE TOOLS OF THE CULTURE\n\n---\n\nACCESS TO A VARIETY OF CARING ADULTS, WHO ARE HELPERS, NOT JUDGES\n\n---\n\nNone of us, regardless of age, can be fully honest with–fully willing to show our vulnerability to and ask for help from–people whose business it is to evaluate us. When we think we are being evaluated, we go into impression-management mode, in which we show off what we know and can do well and avoid what we don’t know or can’t do well. Evaluation also induces anxiety, which interferes with learning. Impression management and anxiety are antithetical to education, yet they are characteristics that our standard schools are well designed to promote.\n\n---\n\nFREE AGE MIXING AMONG CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS\n\n---\n\nIMMERSION IN A STABLE, SUPPORTIVE, RESPECTFUL COMMUNITY\n\n---\n\nChildren attending a school or learning center for Self-Directed Education are integral, full members of the school community. They learn to care for one another within the community and for the community itself. They are involved, democratically, in making and upholding the community rules. In that process they hear all sides of every disagreement and the moral and logical arguments related to it. Their own views are taken seriously by others and influence the community’s decisions, which motivates them to think more deeply about those views than they otherwise might.\n\n---\n\nFamilies, in successful home-based Self-Directed Education, likewise respect and value their children’s ideas and concerns and allow those to play a role in family decisions.\n\n---\n\n2020-11-10T02:58:39.000Z  · This note was created with LINER By Vince Imbat\n\nHighlighted Source : [https://share.getliner.com/mftWx](https://share.getliner.com/mftWx)\n\nOriginal Source : [https://www.self-directed.org/sde/conditions/](https://www.self-directed.org/sde/conditions/)\n\n## References",

It is simply faith, that whatever the outcome of my actions, I am strong enough to face them.\n\nI turned 27 last February. I am still young in the eyes of most people. But deep inside, I feel very, very old. Having gone through a lot of suffering and going through them with a very sensitive mind and body, there are times when I honestly feel like I had it.\n\nI feel like I’m no longer ready to take on another fight.\n\nI’m no longer putting myself in places where I might be hurt.\n\nI’m staying put.\n\nHere.\n\nIn this hole I’m digging.\n\nIn oblivion.\n\nWhen I am in this space, of lifelessness, days seem to be so long. Routines are shattered. And escape is the most logical thing to do.\n\nIt is a place of weakness.\n\nOf numbness.\n\nOf an inability to trust, to have faith, to be courageous, and, therefore, to continue.\n\nLife becomes simply a quick detour towards death.\n\nIn this circumstance, the body and mind slows down.\n\nAnd this is when something radical happens.\n\nWhen all is done.\n\nWhen all that makes sense is to live within the cold confines of disbelief.\n\nWhen the body and the mind refuses to respond to any form of stimulation.\n\nA “deep rest” ensues.\n\nA humble return down to earth. To _humus_.\n\nDeep down to that which resides within.\n\nA mysterious calm visits.\n\nMost people miss this inner miracle.\n\nBefore they see this happen within them, they have already thrown the towel.\n\nBut it is a place where a complete reversal of the dark descent begins to occur.\n\nIt is a fertile soil where new seeds of faith, of trust, and of courage germinate.\n\nFor me, such miraculous moments take the form of a beautiful sunset, a quiet morning, a delicious meal, or a rejuvenating conversation with a dear friend.\n\nSometimes, they even take the form of written words, of captivating artworks, of soothing melodies.\n\nWhatever form they take, they bring peace, stability, and calm.\n\nCalm enough for one to see possibilities.\n\nCalm enough for one to see that one can still move through life.\n\nI am old enough to understand that life is nothing but a game of acquisition and loss. We gain things, but we also lose them. Thus, to live is almost always to bring one’s full presence on moments of joy, when one has things, and to bring that same full presence when one loses them.\n\nOne’s learned capacity to go through this ebb and flow of life is what saves our lives from self-annihilation. It is what brings hope. It is strength.\n",

    "content": "\n![The Tea House Zendo at Baguio](tea_house_zendo_baguio.jpg)\n\nThis is the tea house zendo at Baguio where I try to visit every week to practice meditation.\n\nThe tea house is surrounded by flowering shrubs and a little forest of seemingly old pine trees. There is a mysterious difficulty in describing the ambiance inside the zendo, much like the difficulty of putting meditative trance into words.\n\nI once experienced writing inside the zendo, sitting on a short chair while looking outside the window. That writing session, I'm afraid, brought me deeper into my consciousness more than all the sitting meditations I did inside the zendo. But that is perhaps because writing comes more natural to me than sitting down and counting my breath.\n\nMeditation is one of the hardest things that ever happened to me, and mind you, I went through a lot in this young body of mine. But it also was the single thing that made the biggest difference in my life after 2011.\n\nIf there is one practice, dare I say \"skill,\" that one could cultivate and affect every area of one's life, it's mindfulness. And it doesn't really matter what kind of mindful practice one uses to cultivate mindfulness, as long as one does so.\n\nThe Pareto principle says that 80% of results come from just 20% of the effort. For me, mindfulness is the 20% factor that makes the most difference in all aspects of my life. And that is why I cultivate it, both when it's easy and when it's hard.\n",

    "title": "The Value of Time - How Much is Your Time Really Worth? by James Clear",
    "content": "\nUnderstanding how to get the most out of your time starts with knowing—in exact terms—what your time is worth.\n\nAt some level, we all have an internal gauge for how much our time is worth.\n\nOn extreme ends of the spectrum, it is easy to know if a task is worth your time. As you move toward the middle of the time-value spectrum, however, it becomes less clear if a particular task is worth your time or not. And this is the problem: most of life is lived in the gray zone of the time-value spectrum.\n\nEveryone has an hourly value, but very few people can actually tell you what that number is.\n\nUnless you are getting paid your hourly rate every hour of every day, then the value of your time is not the same as your hourly rate.”\n\n## Part I: Realized Income Methods\n\nWe will start by using Realized Income Methods to calculate the value of your time. These calculations are based only on income you have actually received (or realized), hence the name Realized Income Methods.\n\nTo get started, you need two numbers:\n\n1.  The amount of time you spend to earn money.\n2.  The amount of money you earn during that time.\n\n## Step 1: How to Track Your Time\n\nThe first step is to measure the total amount of time you invest to earn money, not just the hours you are physically at work.\n\nIf you’re unsure how much time you spend working, I recommend using 2,500 hours per year as a starting point.\n\n## Step 2: How to Track How Much Money You Earn\n\nThe number we are trying to calculate is your take-home pay. This is the amount of money you have left after deducting taxes.\n\nIf you are also an entrepreneur, I recommend using yearly earnings for these calculations because small business income can fluctuate (sometimes drastically) from month to month. Looking at your earnings over a longer time period helps to smooth out these inconsistencies and provide a more realistic value of your time.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the Value of Your Time\n\ndivide your total money earned (Step 2) by your total time spent (Step 1)\n\nalthough we might know what we would charge per hour, we rarely calculate how much time goes into earning money outside of our working hours. By accounting for all of the time we invest to earn money, we get a clearer picture of what our time is actually worth—and it is usually much less than what you would charge for an hour of work on your job.\n\n## References\n\nClear, J.

I remember calling you Doctor, after a game I just learned to play the day before. I was little, sitting on that short bicycle I am not sure existed. I was in awe of the house you were building with my grandfather, and I hid under the gumamela shrubs and the large kamansi tree in terrible fear. What came before this memory, I am not sure of.

I approached my religion with a perspective of a scholar especially during the last year of high school and first year of college.

I read how [[Karl Marx]] labelled religion as the opium of the people, how religion only exists because of this opiate function, and that it is a social construct created by humans not by God. Despite bombardment of radical views, I remained faithful to my beliefs and grew deeper in my religious devotion. I volunteered in the Deaf ministry, a challenging ministry that not many JWs were willing to take, and quite honestly we in the Deaf ministry were discriminated even by our fellow JWs.\n- In 2011, I went through a spiralling depression, which led me to want to die and attempt vengeance against God.\n- I read the book [[Bondage of the Mind]] and [[The Bible as History]], and never looked at the Old Testament the same way again.\n- I started being interested in [[Humanism]].\n- I went back to school and joined a political party.

    "content": "\nBased on the [[Etymology of the word religion]], the meaning of the word has changed in multiple ways that definitions now abound and are incoherent. Some entities considered a religion in one definition is excluded in another. This incoherence is due to the fact that the concept religion involves both an aspect of society and the structure of human subjectivity (See [[The true, the beautiful, and the good]]).\n\nBecause of the incoherent way the concept of religion is used today, we need to establish whether it even has an essence. In addition, because the concept of religion arose from a specific place and time, changed throughout history, and used to discriminate other cultures, we need to establish whether it even corresponds to something real in the universe or should we just stop using it.\n\n# References\n\nSchilbrack, K.

To a great extent, however, this is because these arguments have not simply been about a particular aspect of society but rather have served as proxy in a debate about the structure of human subjectivity.\n\u003e\n\u003eFirst, the disparate variety of practices now said to fall within this category raises a question of whether one can understand this social taxon in terms of necessary and sufficient properties or whether instead one should instead treat it as a family resemblance concept. Here, the question is whether the concept religion can be said to have an essence.\n\u003e\n\u003e Second, the recognition that the concept has shifted its meanings, that it arose at a particular time and place but was unknown elsewhere, and that it has so often been used to denigrate certain cultures, raises the question whether the concept corresponds to any kind of entity in the world at all or whether, instead, it is simply a rhetorical device that should be retired.\n\u003e \n\u003e A concept used for scrupulous devotion was retooled to refer to a particular type of social practice. But the question—what type?—is now convoluted. The cosmic version of the concept is broader than the polytheistic version, which is in turn broader than the theistic version, and the functional definitions shift the sense of the term into a completely different register. What is counted as religion by one definition is often not counted by others.\n\n",

Protecting our attention is protecting our freedom.\n\nBecause this is the only thing we can control, we could conclude that everything is ultimately a mental game ([[Life is almost all about subjective experiences]]). The quality of our lives is directly proportional with the quality of our emotions, which is to say, the quality of our mental states ([[The quality of my entire life is the quality of my habitual emotions - Tony Robbins]]; [[To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts - Thoreau]]).

    "title": "The philosophical method of Henry Bugbee",
    "content": "\nIn the Preface of [[thoughts/the inward morning by bugbee]], Henry Bugbee presents his method. Here are some interesting points.\n\n- He prefers to use the journal form to present his philosophical exploration to maintain emotion in his work. This intention confirms that his work is an example of [[thoughts/lyrical philosophy]]. The journal form allows the presentation of the history of the ideas as they arrived to the subject, which is what poetry and narrative does ([[Poetry and narrative trace their history so readers can re-enact them]]).\n- He describes the arrival of his ideas as [[thoughts/meditation]]. When they come throughout \"the very rhythm of daily life,\" he allows them to come and direct where they wanted to go. He lets them flow. He does not prevent them from departing, and does not make more of them as they presently are. (To do: Thoreau has a similar approach. Include that here.)\n- He uses the day as a form of constraint to his work. His work starts and ends within the day. Again, this is very Thoreauvian not just because Thoreau contemplated about [[The day as a context for one's work]], but also because the cyclical nature of the day is mimicked by [[thoughts/walking]]; it is leaving and returning, a romantic excursion ([[Thoreau and the literary excursion — Buell]]).\n- Bugbee sees philosophy's goal as to uncover the \"truth underlying human decision.\" We meditate because we are uncertain. We do not know what to do. We are unsure. In this sense, this uncertainty is a form of bondage that prevents us from achieving true freedom. Meditative thought is what helps us to confront the uncertainties and to push the will towards clarity and decision-making. The uncovering of such truth is necessary to achieve certainty, for man to know how to act and act appropriately at any given moment. Once certainty is achieved, and one acts wholeheartedly, true freedom is achieved. This is finality. This happens in a daily basis (\"Meditation is of the day precisely as the human will is\"). Every day is a battle between the will and bondage.\n- As it is in finality of action, finality in word spoken can also be achieved. Every word you speak or write now or today is \"final\" in the sense that it represents where you are now. Even if the ultimate understanding is unrealized and you are still bondaged by uncertainty, the word you write or speak today, which itseld represents uncertainty, is final. Saying it as it is even if you are still uncertain signifies that the will has won. It is as if you are declaring \"I am certain of my uncertainty.\"\n- I find that this issue of finality, certainty, and freedom is very much connected to an insight I had before that learning how to live is difficult because [[We learn to live while we are living]]\n\n# References\n\nBugbee, H. (1999). _The Inward Morning: A Philosophical Exploration in Journal Form_. The University of Georgia Press.\n\n\u003eAnd since the themes which occupied me in these pages undergo as much reflective analysis as they do, why not organize at least some of the ideas which are recurrently developed into a more systematic form? Why not cut free from the bad days and supply a better substitute for the continuity of those days in the overall task? Over and over I tried to act on such considerations as these. And each time the heart went out of the ideas themselves. They lost their actual exploratory cast. I found I was in danger of betraying the very undertaking in which experience yielded them their measure of meaning and support.\n\u003e\n\u003eAs I would put it now, the guidance of meditation, of the themes received in meditation, is the fundamental feature of the work; and the themes of meditation live a life of their own, perhaps wiser than one knows in their advent and departure, in the things they gather to themselves as relevant to their formation, in the memories with which they visit one and establish their own concrete meaning. It was my work to attend upon such themes, in the very rhythm of daily life; to follow them where they might lead; not to put them off when they came to me, not to bid them stay beyond their actual departure; and not to try to make more of them than I presently could.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe present day—that is the dwelling of meditative thought. Consequently this work is in journal form. Not because it is a philosophical notebook or diary; it is neither of these. It is basically a work which required to be done within the day, from the actual human stance which the day might afford, whatever that day might bring.\n\u003e\n\u003eMeditation is of the day precisely as the human will is. For meditation is the thoughtful reckoning of the will with its own life: Its concern is that of truth underlying human decision. Cut off from the central nerve of responsible being, the themes of meditation fall dead. My task has been that of overcoming such abstraction, to ac- comodate the life of spirit with all the mind. These pages may serve as a record of such a tendency of thought, and they may testify with some accuracy to the unpredictable alternation between bondage and freedom in which the ambiguity of the human condition is lived, but now and again resolved.\n\u003e\n\u003eWhat I have called finality proves to be the unifying theme of the work. By finality I intend the meaning of reality as realized in true decision. The vein in which it comes to us is the vein of wonder, of faith, of certainty. It is the ground of ultimate human concern with which the will is informed. It comes clearest in every unique deed of purest generosity, in which a man gives of himself without stint and with all care. In this disclipined liberality is true freedom.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe term 'finality' seems to me just: It stands for what is first and last with us. It is redolent of all first and last words—words in which human destiny comes to ultimate articulation\n\u003e\n\u003eThe tone of a final word is the tone of reality as definitively given. Accordingly finality must harbor all that requires expression as genuine in human life, including all man- ner of contraries, such as those our evaluations so often express, as in speaking of good days and bad days. That meaning of reality which is final and decisive comes to us as redeeming, authoritatively demanding, and promising. A final word cannot be the mere con- trary and correlative of others. It must be a word in which all words come to a unity of affirmation. It must be found anew, again and again, as just that word which a man can give now, steeped in all that is unknown and cannot be known in our lives. It cannot be made captive in terms themselves, or in any of the cumulative resources at our disposal. It comes to meet us in our acceptance of the frontier of our daily lives.\n\u003e\n\u003eThus the meaning of a final word is universal; it is uniquely spoken, or not at all; and it is never said once for all. For the meaning of reality is not independent of the life of the will. In this life we all move from day to day. The more faithfully we do so, the more ours is an eternal present, and the more we can share in testifying that this is indeed _our_ life.",

Regarding aspiration, I want to be a philosopher who wants to live deliberately through an existential quest that inspires intentional living. I want to write about this quest beautifully and poetically, ideally with images. I want to make philosophy as intimate as possible. These are his aspirations too. But this is where our similarity ends. In terms of philosophical content, we are very different.\n\nThoreau is a metaphysical idealist ([[Idealism]]). He is also a nondualist ([[Nonduality]]). In addition, he believes that value arises from nature [[Moral realism]]. Meanwhile I am a dualist and an amoralist.\n\nThoreau's idealism flows naturally into his poetry, walking, journal entries, etc. Idealism seems to have a clear connection with art and the appreciation of beauty. The challenge to me then is how can I reconcile the affection I feel from nature while maintaining what I know is true—that nature is value-free.\n\nThoreau developed his own flavor of transcendentalism.\n\nQuestion to myself: [[How can I combine truth and beauty in one philosophical practice?]]",

Zalta (Ed.), The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2022). Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University. https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2022/entries/concept-religion/\n\n\u003eChristian theologians traditionally analyzed the anatomy of their way of life as simultaneously fides, fiducia, and fidelitas. Each of these terms might be translated into English as “faith”, but each actually corresponds to a different dimension of a social practice. Fides refers to a cognitive state, one in which a person assents to a certain proposition and takes it as true. It could be translated as “belief” or “intellectual commitment”. Beliefs or intellectual commitments distinctive to participation in the group will be present whether or not a religious form of life has developed any authoritative doctrines. In contrast, fiducia refers to an affective state in which a person is moved by a feeling or experience that is so positive that it bonds the recipient to its source. It could be translated as “trust” or “emotional commitment”. Trust or emotional commitment will be present whether or not a religious form of life teaches that participation in their practices aims at some particular experience of liberation, enlightenment, or salvation. And fidelitas refers to a conative state in which a person commits themselves to a path of action, a path that typically involves emulating certain role models and inculcating the dispositions that the group considers virtuous. It could be translated as “loyalty” or “submission”. Loyalty or submission will be present whether or not a religious form of life is theistic or teaches moral rules. By the time of Martin Luther, Christian catechisms organized these aspects of religious life in terms of the “three C’s”: the creed one believed, the cult or worship one offered, and the code one followed.\n\u003e \n\u003e These three dimensions of religious practices—symbolically, the head, the heart, and the hand—are not necessarily Christian. In fact, until one adds a delimiting criterion like those discussed above, these dimensions are not even distinctively religious. Creed, cult, and code correspond to any pursuit of what a people considers true, beautiful, and good, respectively, and they will be found in any collective movement or cultural tradition. As Melford Spiro says, any human institution will involve a belief system, a value system, and an action system (Spiro 1966: 98).\n\u003e \n\u003e Many have complained that arguments about how religion should be defined seem unresolvable. To a great extent, however, this is because these arguments have not simply been about a particular aspect of society but rather have served as proxy in a debate about the structure of human subjectivity. There is deep agreement among the rival positions insofar as they presuppose the cognitive-affective-conative model of being human.\n\u003e \n\u003e what we might call a “Cartesian” cohort argues that cognition is the root of religious emotions and actions. This cohort includes the “intellectualists”\n\u003e \n\u003e A “Humean” cohort disagrees, arguing that affect is what drives human behavior and that cognition serves merely to justify the values one has already adopted.\n\u003e \n\u003e A “Kantian” cohort treats beliefs and emotions regarding supernatural realities as relatively unimportant and argues instead that for religion the will is basic.[7] This approach treats a religion as at root a set of required actions (e.g., Vásquez 2011; C. Smith 2017). These different approaches disagree about the essence of religion, but all three camps operate within a shared account of the human.\n\u003e \n\u003e There have been some attempts to leave this three-part framework. For example, some in the Humean camp have suggested that religion is essentially a particular feeling with zero cognition. But that romantic suggestion collapses under the inability to articulate how an affective state can be noncognitive but still identifiable as a particular feeling (Proudfoot 1985).",

Instead, it spends most of its time providing an account of the universe as a whole from the perspective of the author.\n\nHis choice of this form may in part be due to the fact that it was a popular form in his time. Thoreau has read over 146 travel books.\n\nTravel literature could still be instructive while still being delightful. It was more literary than factual.\n\nAmong all of the travel books he read, William Gilpin's Remarks of Forest Scenery and Other Woodland Views was perhaps closest to Thoreau's taste.\n\n\u003eHis favorite form, as noted earlier, is the romantic excursion: a ramble (\" Walking\" )or trip (Cape Cod) or sojourn (Walden) which takes on overtones of a spiritual quest as the speaker proceeds.

This very transcendental mode of perception gives rise to what John Broderick rightly calls the fundamental movement of Thoreau's prose-from observation to speculation and back again-and to his breadth of allusion.\n\u003e\n\u003eThoreau began with his environment and tried to invest it with meaning. Temporal continuity in his writing is usualIy more important than the continuity of abstract ideas\n\n**Thoreau's travel writing**\n\n\u003eits attempt to intermix facts and entertainment, its academic wit, and its tendency to overrefine ideas.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe center of literary interest in such writing, Curtis goes on to say, is not what the traveler sees or the adventures he experiences, but the self-portrayal of the traveller himself.\n\u003e\n\u003estressing the importance of the individual mind over that of empirical fact.\n\u003e\n\u003ewhat \"we care to read about\" in travel books is not paintings and churches and rivers and mountains, \"but the reflection of these in genial and original minds.\"\n\u003e\n\u003eTrue travel is spiritual travel, an exploration of one's own higher latitudes.\n\u003e\n\u003eThey simply desired to make it spiritually valid, or, in Thoreau's case, to make the best of their inability to gratify it fully. Such motives reinforced their natural literary predilection for the abstract and subjective dimensions\n\u003e\n\u003eThoreau interspersed descriptive sketches with verse fragments, prose poetry, and quaint bits of historical lore\n\u003e\n\u003eIn all these cases one becomes conscious of an interplay between the sequence of actual observations and the interests of a subjectively imposed mood or design. Neither dominates to the exclusion of the other; rather, the works oscillate between the two structural principles.\n\u003e\n\u003eThoreau had but a limited interest in the purely picturesque; but his mode of writing does resemble Irving's in most of the ways listed here-in its descriptive, peripatetic, and miscellaneous or hybrid character: part sketch, part information, part narrative, part wit, part philosophy.\n\u003e\n\u003eThoreau demanded that the observer enter into a total relation with the thing observed.\n\u003e\n\u003eEven when considered as a travelogue, Walden emerges as Thoreau's masterpiece, of course, for not only does it carry the principle of significant travel as interior travel farther than any other Transcendentalist work, it is also more thorough and sophisticated on the level of observation than the rest of Thoreau's writing.\n\u003e\n\u003eOf all Thoreau's books, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers is probably most illuminated by an understanding of the travel-writing tradition, because it presents on the surface the most perplexing mixture of subject matters and levels of style.\n\nThoreau's travel writing was influenced by the trends of his day\n\u003emost travelogues used one of two models: the sequential, sometimes day-by-day (Tu- dor's \"A Tour,\" lrving's Tour, Brackenridge's Journal), or the topical (Mme de Stael's Germany, Tocqueville's Democracy in America, Emerson's English Traits). Thoreau preferred the former model in general, though he used the latter in Walden. A literary travel book was not expected to have a very coherent structure; one of its pleasures, indeed, as James Russell Lowell said in his review of Thoreau's A Week, was in its \" happy fortuity.\"\n\u003e\n\u003eA talent for observation and description was a sine qua non, but romantic travelers were expected to go beyond this and tell not simply \"what has happened to them,\" but \" how they have happened to the universe,\" in Thoreau's words\n\u003e\n\u003ethere were no special ground rules for the order in which a travel writer should proceed-that would depend on the order of observation or reflection, but there was an unspoken commitment to totality.\n\u003e\n\u003eIn the popular romantic excursions of the era there is, so to speak, a convention of levity, a tacit assumption that the prevailing atmosphere is going to be bucolic reverie or musing, which will furnish both author and reader an escape from business and the city into a pastoral dream-world.\n\nThoreau's writing, which follows the romantic excursion, exhibit that he was not immensely concerned with literary architectonics.\n\n\u003ethe prevailing critical approach to Thoreau carries with it the somewhat misleading implication that literary architectonics was (or should have been) of immense concern to him. In fact, none of his books, not even Walden) is very tightly unified, nor probably designed to be, for the romantic excursion is as much a record of events and impressions as it is a poem. Even in the course of so analytical a work as Walden there are all sorts of meanderings and digressions\n\nHis desire to prophecy made Thoreau different from other excurion writers\n\n\u003eThe difference between Whitman and Thoreau and the popular excursion, in addition to the fact that their writing is simply more difficult, is that they refuse to do no more than daydream; they must also prophesy, whereas Margaret Fuller is largely content to remain on the level of description and anecdote. This made Whitman and Thoreau less popular but truer to Transcendentalist ideals of art.\n\nThoreau was a stylist, but his choice of style was governed not by literary structure but by the demands of his vision.\n\n\u003eIt is not that these passages bear no relation to the over- all drift of the book, but that their charm lies more in their heterogeneity and unpredictableness than in their contribution to an overarching whole. Like a Whitman catalogue, Thoreau's writing is to be more appreciated as process than as product, more for its irregular flow than for any patterns which can be abstracted from it, although the awareness of such patterns naturally enhances one's pleasure in the work.\n\u003e\n\u003eLike all literary travel narratives, Walden is an aesthetic mongrel, a mixture of the actual and the fictive, a report of real occurrences which have been reshaped, in different degrees, by the processes of selection, reflection, ordering, heightening, and mythologizing.\n\nWhat the excursion meant to Thoreau in life\n\n\u003eThis gets at the heart of what the excursion meant for Thoreau, both in life and as a literary endeavor. It was a succession of confrontations with nature, from each of which the observer is expected to extract as much as he can, the mark of success being not so much in the planning of one's itinerary or imaginative rearrangement of events as in the way in which he runs the gamut of events as they occur.\n\nA Week is a narrative with philosophical interpolations\n\u003eA Week primarily as a narrative with philosophical interpolations which mar its unity, and those who see it as a thematic progression with certain unassimilable elements.\n\nTo Read\n\n- Broderick, \"The Movement of Thoreau's Prose,\" American Literature, 33 (1961), 133-142.\n- Christie, Thoreau as World Traveler (New York: Columbia University Press, 1965).\n\n# References\n",

This is why [[The magnum opus of Thoreau is his journal]].\n\nHis focus on content is perhaps the reason why he was never really a good poet.

He piled his high and tightly. If this were not well done the stakes would spread and the wood lie loosely, and so the rain and snow find their way into it. And he added, \"I have handled a good deal of wood, and I think that I understand the *philosophy* of it.\"\n\n(Journal, December 15, 1859)\n\nThis is an example of [[Lenient use of “philosophy”]].\n\n# References\n\nThoreau, H.

If Thoreau kept a journal through these years, it is lost; if he wrote letters home, they are gone; when he ventured into poetry, his verses mostly vanished.42 What survives are his essays for Channing.

To Brownson, education was the key to creating true equality, which meant the key to remedying all the evils of society.

Then talk to people in those career paths about their path to that job. How those people got to their position will help you craft a 1 month project where you build the skills that will help you follow the career path of the people that have the job you want.\n\nAnalyze the jobs you could work towards getting, pick one of these, talk to people who got this job about how they got that job. Use this specific info as a guide to work on a 1 month project where you get closer to this job.\n\n***\nCareer Capital Theory states that the traits for a fulfilling job are rare and valuable. Thus, basic economics says that to earn those, you have to have something to offer in return (rare and valuable skills).\n\nYou want great autonomy, impact, and connection to people. You focus on how to build up skills with unambiguous and desirable value in the marketplace.\n\nFocus on a few items that make the biggest impact.\n\nYou can’t just interview someone to get good advice. Need to ask the right questions. This fallacy applies to our internal thinking about how to improve our lives/career. It’s easy to come up with a plan of action that seems satisfying and seems plausible\n\nYou need difficult objectivity when thinking about how to improve. Athletes at the pro level don’t just come up with training regimes on their own. We have coaches who are experts with decades of experience studying, teaching, and training.\n\nIt’s much harder to come up with a system or plan that will actually work (and takes more work).\n\nif you are one of the few who has the objective mind to go through the difficult process of assessment, then you will reach a blue ocean where you are able to seek vast improvements to your desired skills.\n\nYou don’t need a large amount of passion to begin the process at getting good at something.\n\nHow do I make a decision about leaving job vs. doing more in existing job? People tend to think in terms of match philosophy — specific job match. A better match implies the more we will enjoy the job. You are always going to be able to come up with potential jobs that will be a better match. This is a recipe for anxiety. Traits to love your job are not connected to a specific match. It has to do with more general traits. The four most important traits are: **Autonomy, Mastery, Connection, Creativity**. These traits lead people to feel passion towards their work.\n\nWhat are your current career capital? Can you use that right now to reshape your position to have more of this in your work? Good opportunities in you current job to put in work and initiative to build up your career capital in current company? If there are good opportunities to do that and your current job will give you a lot of leeway to invest that into reshaping your working work, then stick with it. Making a shift really only makes sense if you think of your options. You may need to shift into another job or career that will pay off more. You can develop skills faster and put them to work to use them as leverage. This is one reason to switch. The other reasons to switch is because of deal breaker clauses. If the work is against your morals, switch. If the people are terrible, switch. If there are limits to your ability to acquire skill, switch.\n\nTake small steps to explore new ideas, to learn new skills. Build those skills, then from this vantage point, you can set a new vantage point going forward. I experienced an evolutionary process where I was examining the situation I was in and working on key skills — becoming a better writer, running an online business, building information products. This developed over time. From what I’ve seen, those who have a very successful career all have a similar philosophy. It’s not a rigid philosophy about doing exactly X. It’s also not the opposite of throwing your hands up in the air and having no clue what to do.\n\n# References",

This is like saying its function is to erase itself.\n\nPage 10\n\n**Self-actualization . . . paradoxically makes more possible the transcendence of self, and of self-consciousness and of selfishness.**\n\nself-actualization makes it easier to merge as a part of a larger whole.\n\nThe fully developed (and very fortunate) human being working under the best conditions tends to be motivated by values which transcend his self.\n\n**That’s weird—that I should be enabled to perceive, accept, \u0026 enjoy the eternity \u0026 preciousness of the non-me world just because I became aware of my own mortality. The “being able to enjoy” is puzzling.**\n\nthe awareness of his mortality actually heightened his own personal experience of transcendence\n\nDuring the last few years of his life, Maslow was working on a series of exercises to transcend the ego and live more regularly in the “B-realm”—the realm of “pure Being.” He was also working on a comprehensive psychology and philosophy of human nature and society.\n\nPage 11\n\nto help people reach their full potential, we need to take into account the whole person\n\nPage 12\n\nthe more we have limiting notions of potential that are dictated by others (schoolteachers, parents, managers, etc.), the more blind we become to the full potential of each and every unique individual and their own unique path to self-actualization and transcendence.\n\nwe all have extraordinary creative, humanitarian, and spiritual possibilities but are often alienated from them because we are so focused on a very narrow slice of who we are. As a result, we aren’t fulfilling our full potential. **We spend so much time looking outward for validation that we don’t develop the incredible strengths that already lie within, and we rarely take the time to fulfill our deepest needs in the most growth-oriented and integrated fashion.**\n\nso many people today are striving for “transcendence” without a healthy integration of their other needs—to the detriment of their full potential.\n\n**While there is a yearning to be part of a larger political or religious ideology, the realization of this yearning is often built on hate and hostility for the “other,” rather than on pride and deep commitment for a cause that can better humanity. In essence, there is a lot of pseudo-transcendence going on, resting on a “very shaky foundation.”**\n\nThe integration of a wide variety of perspectives is necessary for a more complete understanding of the full depths of human potential, as too much focus on a single perspective runs the risk of giving a distorted view of human nature.\n\n**the best way to move toward greater growth and transcendence is not by ignoring the inevitability of human suffering but by integrating everything that is within you. This requires penetrating the depths of your being with piercing awareness with the intent of experiencing the full richness of human existence.** This is very much in line with Maslow’s call for a “Being-Psychology,” which incorporates a full understanding of human needs that transcends the “psychopathology of the average” but also “incorporate[s] all its findings in a more inclusive and comprehensive structure which includes both the sick and the healthy, both deficiency, Becoming and Being.”\n\nthere is an art of being. But now there is also a science of being.\n\nPage 14\n\nthose who are reaching the full heights of their humanity tend to possess the characteristics most of us seek in life; they tend to be **altruistic, creative, open, authentic, accepting, independent, and brave**. However, Maslow did not prescribe that one must be this way. Instead, it was his belief that **if society can create the conditions to satisfy one’s basic needs—including the freedom to speak honestly and openly, to grow and develop one’s unique capacities and passions, and to live in societies with fairness and justice—what naturally and organically emerges tends to be the characteristics that resemble the best in humanity.**\n\nMaslow viewed the role of the teacher, therapist, and parent as horticulturists, whose task is to “**enable people to become healthy and effective in their own style.**”\n\n“we try to make a rose into a good rose, rather than seek to change roses into lilies. . . . It necessitates a **pleasure in the self-actualization of a person who may be quite different from yourself**. It even implies an **ultimate respect and acknowledgement of the sacredness and uniqueness of each kind of person**.”\n\n**“Being-Psychology”—a field that involves the systematic investigation of ends rather than means—end-experiences (such as wonder, laughter, and connection), end-values (such as beauty, truth, and justice), end-cognitions (such as efficient perception of reality and newness of appreciation), end-goals (such as having an ultimate concern or purpose), and with treating people as ends unto themselves, not means to an end (what Maslow referred to as “Being-Love,” or “B-Love” for short).**\n\n“positive psychology” or “orthopsychology”—was in response to a psychology focused more on “not-having rather than having,” “striving rather than fulfillment,” “frustration rather than gratification,” “seeking joy rather than having attained joy,” and “trying to get there rather than being there.”\n\nPage 15\n\nEventually, the Third Force psychologists became known as the “humanistic psychologists,” and the field was officially created when Maslow and Anthony Sutich launched The Journal of Humanistic Psychology in 1961. Today, there exist a number of psychotherapists and researchers explicitly working within the humanistic psychology tradition (many of them refer to themselves as “existential-humanistic” psychotherapists)\n\n**Within the humanistic psychology framework, the healthy personality is considered one that constantly moves toward freedom, responsibility, self-awareness, meaning, commitment, personal growth, maturity, integration, and change, rather than one that predominantly strives for status, achievement, or even happiness.**\n\nToday, humanistic psychologists and positive psychologists share a desire to understand and foster healthy motivation and healthy living\n\nThe following thirteen **sources of well-being** have been rigorously studied over the past forty years, and each one can be reached in your own style\n\n**More positive emotions**\n\n**Fewer negative emotions**\n\n**Vitality (a positive subjective sense of physical health and energy)**\n\n**Life satisfaction (a positive subjective evaluation of one’s life overall)**\n\n**Environmental mastery (the ability to shape environments to suit one’s needs and desires; to feel in control of one’s life; to not feel overwhelmed by the demands and responsibilities of everyday life)**\n\n**Positive relationships**\n\n**Self-acceptance**\n\n**Mastery (feelings of competence in accomplishing challenging tasks; a sense of effectiveness in accomplishing important goals one has set for oneself)**\n\n**Autonomy**\n\n**Personal growth**\n\n**Engagement in life**\n\n**Purpose and meaning in life (a sense that one’s life matters, is valuable, and is worth living; a clear sense of direction and meaning in one’s efforts; a connection to something greater than oneself)**\n\n**Transcendent experiences (experiences of awe, flow, inspiration, and gratitude in daily life)**\n\nNote that many of these sources of well-being go beyond stereotypical notions of happiness. **Becoming fully human is about living a full existence, not one that is continually happy. Being well is not always about feeling good; it also involves continually incorporating more meaning, engagement, and growth in one’s life**—key themes in humanistic psychology.\n\nI believe the new hierarchy of needs can serve as a useful organizing framework for the field of psychology as well as a useful guide for your own personal journey of health, growth, and transcendence.\n\nPage 16\n\nWhile rarely acknowledged as one, Maslow was actually a developmental psychologist at heart.\n\nMaslow emphasized that **we are always in a state of becoming and that one’s “inner core” consists merely of “potentialities, not final actualizations”**\n\nMaslow made it clear that **human maturation is an ongoing process and that growth is “not a sudden, salatory phenomenon” but is often two steps forward and one step back.**\n\nAn underdiscussed aspect of Maslow’s theory is that **his hierarchy of needs serves as an organizing framework for different states of mind—ways of looking at the world and at others.** Maslow argued that, **when deprived, each need is associated with its own distinctive world outlook, philosophy, and outlook on the future**\n\nAnother peculiar characteristic of the human organism **when it is dominated by a certain need is that the whole philosophy of the future tends also to change. For our chronically and extremely hungry man, Utopia can be defined simply as a place where there is plenty of food.**\n\nLife itself tends to be defined in terms of eating. Anything else will be defined as unimportant.\n\nmost people “are partially satisfied in all their basic needs and partially unsatisfied in all their basic needs at the same time.”\n\n**“any behavior tends to be determined by several or all of the basic needs simultaneously rather than by only one of them,” and that any one of us at any moment in time can return to a particular state of mind depending on the deprivation of the need.**\n\n[The human needs] are arranged in an integrated hierarchy rather than dichotomously, that is, they rest one upon another. . . . This means that **the process of regression to lower needs remains always as a possibility, and in this context must be seen not only as pathological or sick, but as absolutely necessary to the integrity of the whole organism, and as prerequisite to the existence and functioning of the ‘higher needs.**\n\nThe English humanistic psychotherapist John Rowan used the analogy of Russian nesting dolls to illustrate Maslow’s notion of an integrated hierarchy: **each larger doll includes all the smaller dolls but also transcends them.**\n\n**Once we are working on our highest purpose, for instance, our needs for safety, connection, or self-esteem don’t vanish; instead, they become integrated with our more transcendent purpose. When the whole person is well-integrated, all of their basic needs are not merely met but work together to facilitate growth toward realizing their highest goals and values.**\n\nAnother implication here is that **if you try to grow too soon without a healthy integration of your insecurities and deprivations, the growth is less likely to reach its full height.**\n\n**we are continually returning to our basic needs to draw strength**, learn from our hardships, and work toward greater integration of our whole being.\n\nPage 17\n\nMaslow never actually created a pyramid to represent his hierarchy of needs.\n\n“Maslow’s Pyramid” was actually created by a management consultant in the sixties. From there, it quickly became popular in the emerging field of organization behavior.\n\nthe pyramid resonated with the “prevailing [post-war] ideologies of individualism, nationalism and capitalism in America and justified a growing managerialism in bureaucratic (i.e., layered triangular) formats.\n\nUnfortunately, the continual reproduction of the pyramid in management textbooks had the unfortunate consequence of reducing Maslow’s rich and nuanced intellectual contributions to a parody and has betrayed the actual spirit of Maslow’s notion of **self-actualization as realizing one’s creative potential for humanitarian ends.**\n\nMaslow acknowledged that not only can **our basic needs ebb and flow in salience across a person’s lifetime**, but **there can also be significant cultural and individual differences in the order in which people satisfy their basic needs.**\n\n“People are ‘self-actualizing’ all over the place.”\n\n**Addressing real structural inequalities around the world is absolutely essential to giving everyone opportunities to self-actualize and transcend**, but **this does not mean that people must wait to work toward a deeper sense of fulfillment until more security-related needs are met. We can work on multiple needs simultaneously.**\n\nEven within a society, **people differ in what needs they are most motivated to pursue due to a combination of temperament and environmental experiences.**\n\nAnd even **within individuals, our needs are likely to change in importance as we mature and develop.** Again, the key here is change and growth.\n\nWhile the precise ordering of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs has shown to vary by culture, from person to person, and even within a person’s own lifetime, there is one core aspect of Maslow’s hierarchy that has stood up remarkably well to modern scientific scrutiny.\n\nMaslow argued that **all the needs can be grouped into two main classes of needs, which must be integrated for wholeness: deficiency and growth.**\n\n**Deficiency needs, which Maslow referred to as “D-needs,” are motivated by a lack of satisfaction**, whether it’s the lack of food, safety, affection, belonging, or self-esteem. **The “D-realm” of existence colors all of our perceptions and distorts reality, making demands on a person’s whole being**: “Feed me! Love me! Respect me!”\n\n**The greater the deficiency of these needs, the more we distort reality to fit our expectations and treat others in accordance with their usefulness in helping us satisfy our most deficient needs. In the D-realm, we are also more likely to use a variety of defense mechanisms to protect ourselves from the pain of having such deficiency in our lives.** Our defenses are quite “wise” in the sense that they can help us to avoid unbearable pain that can feel like too much to bear at the moment.\n\nPage 18\n\ngrowth needs—such as self-actualization and transcendence—have a very different sort of wisdom associated with them. Distinguishing between “defensive-wisdom” and “growth-wisdom,” Maslow argued that the Being-Realm of existence (or B-realm, for short) is like replacing a clouded lens with a clear one. **Instead of being driven by fears, anxieties, suspicions, and the constant need to make demands on reality, one is more accepting and loving of oneself and others. Seeing reality more clearly, growth-wisdom is more about “What choices will lead me to greater integration and wholeness?” rather than “How can I defend myself so that I can feel safe and secure?”**\n\nFrom an evolutionary point of view, it makes sense that our safety and security concerns, as well as our desires for short-lived hedonic pleasures, would make greater demands on our attention than our desire to grow as a whole person.\n\nAll that our genes “care” about is getting propagated into the next generation, no matter the cost to the development of the whole person. If this involves narrowing our worldview and causing us to have outsize reactions to the world that aren’t actually in line with reality, so be it.\n\nHowever, such a narrowing of worldview runs the risk of inhibiting a fuller understanding of the world and ourselves. Despite the many challenges to growth, Maslow believed we are all capable of self-actualization, even if most of us do not self-actualize because we spend most of our lives motivated by deficiency.\n\nThere is a general consensus that **optimal functioning of the whole system (whether humans, primates, or machines) requires both stability of goal pursuit in the face of distraction and disruption as well as the capacity for flexibility to adapt and explore the environment.**\n\nThe human condition isn’t a competition; it’s an experience. Life isn’t a trek up a summit but a journey to travel through—a vast blue ocean, full of new opportunities for meaning and discovery but also danger and uncertainty. In this choppy surf, a clunky pyramid is of little use. Instead, what is needed is something a bit more functional. We’ll need a sailboat.\n\nWhile even one plank is better than nothing, the bigger the boat, the more waves you can endure. Likewise in life, **while safety is an essential foundation for feeling secure, adding on strong connections with others and feelings of respect and worthiness will further allow you to weather the storms.**\n\nPage 19\n\nNote that you don’t “climb” a sailboat like you’d climb a mountain or a pyramid. Instead, you open your sail, just like you’d drop your defenses once you felt secure enough. This is an ongoing dynamic: you can be open and spontaneous one minute but can feel threatened enough to prepare for the storm by closing yourself to the world the next minute. **The more you continually open yourself to the world, however, the further your boat will go and the more you can benefit from the people and opportunities around you. And if you’re truly fortunate, you can even enter ecstatic moments of peak experience—where you are really catching the wind. In these moments, not only have you temporarily forgotten your insecurities, but you are growing so much that you are helping to raise the tide for all the other sailboats simply by making your way through the ocean. In this way, the sailboat isn’t a pinnacle but a whole vehicle, helping us to explore the world and people around us, growing and transcending as we do.**\n\nThe needs that comprise the boat itself are **safety, connection, and self-esteem. These three needs work as a whole dynamic system**, and the severe thwarting of any aspect of the whole can have profound effects on the rest of the system. **Under good conditions, the security needs work together to spiral upward toward greater security and stability, but under unfavorable conditions, they can lead to profound insecurity and instability—causing us to get stuck in our journey as we focus our attention on defending ourselves.** Unfortunately, too many people get caught up in insecurity throughout their lives, and stay there, missing out on the immense beauty in the world that is still left to explore and the possibilities for their own self-actualization and, ultimately, transcendence.\n\nThe sail represents growth.\n\n**exploration, love, and purpose. I believe that these three needs capture the essence of how Maslow really conceptualized self-actualization.** Further, I believe **these three needs cannot be reduced to the security needs, or completely reduced to one another (although they can build on one another). These three needs work together synergistically to help us grow as a whole person.** Under favorable conditions, the satisfaction of these needs helps us move toward greater health, wholeness, and transcendence. Under unfavorable conditions, we become preoccupied with safety and security and neglect our possibilities for growth.\n\nAt the base of growth is the spirit of exploration, the fundamental biological drive that all growth needs to have as its foundation. **Exploration is the desire to seek out and make sense of novel, challenging, and uncertain events.**\n\n**While security is primarily concerned with defense and protection, exploration is primarily motivated by curiosity, discovery, openness, expansion, understanding, and the creation of new opportunities for growth and development. The other needs that comprise growth—love and purpose—can build on the fundamental need for exploration to reach higher levels of integration within oneself and to contribute something meaningful to the world.**\n\nI believe **the drive for exploration is the core motive underlying self-actualization** and cannot be completely reduced to any of the other needs, including our evolved drives for affiliation, status, parenting, and mates.\n\nthe hierarchy of needs can be built on an evolutionary foundation, I believe the need for exploration deserves a place at the evolutionary table all on its own.\n\nat the top of the new hierarchy of needs is **the need for transcendence, which goes beyond individual growth (and even health and happiness) and allows for the highest levels of unity and harmony within oneself and with the world.** Transcendence, which rests on a secure foundation of both security and growth, is a perspective in which we can **view our whole being from a higher vantage point with acceptance, wisdom, and a sense of connectedness with the rest of humanity.**\n\nPage 20\n\nnot every goal that satisfies a human being has any direct connection to evolutionary fitness.\n\nThere is this freedom to select various goals and to invent new goals. We can certainly tie them back to certain evolved motives, but you can’t just list the individual’s evolved adaptations and from there be able to figure out what the range of human beings’ possible behaviors is going to be. We have to be able to **give people the freedom to choose from a very large menu of possible goals and pursuits and, even more than that, freedom to invent new ones.**\n\nIn The Sane Society, Erich Fromm argued that the human condition involves the fundamental tension between our common nature with other animals and our uniquely developed capacities for self-awareness, reason, and imagination.\n\nPage 21\n\n“Even though you’re alone in your boat, it’s always comforting to see the lights of the other boats bobbing nearby.”\n\n**four “givens of existence”** that Yalom argues all humans must reconcile\n\n**Death: the inherent tension between wanting to continue to exist and self-actualize and the inevitability of perishing,**\n\n**Freedom: the inherent conflict between the seeming randomness of the universe and the heavy burden of responsibility that comes with the freedom to choose one’s own destiny,**\n\n**Isolation: the inherent tension between, on the one hand, wanting to connect deeply and profoundly with other human beings and be part of a larger whole and, on the other hand, never fully being able to do so, always remaining existentially alone,** and\n\n**Meaninglessness: the tension between being thrown into an indifferent universe that often seems to have no inherent meaning and yet wanting to find some sort of purpose for our own individual existence in the incomprehensibly short time we live on the planet.**\n\nthe new hierarchy of needs is not only a theory of human nature but is ultimately a theory of human existence.\n\n**I do not accept any absolute formulas for living**. No preconceived code can see ahead to everything that can happen in a man’s life. **As we live, we grow and our beliefs change. They must change. So I think we should live with this constant discovery. We should be open to this adventure in heightened awareness of living. We should stake our whole existence on our willingness to explore and experience.**\n\n“No one can build you the bridge on which you, and only you, must cross the river of life. There may be countless trails and bridges and demigods who would gladly carry you across; but only at the price of pawning and forgoing yourself. There is one path in the world that none can walk but you. Where does it lead? Don’t ask, walk!” . . . It is . . . an agonizing, hazardous undertaking thus to dig into oneself, to climb down roughly and directly into the tunnels of one’s being.\n\nthe good life that I present, which is deeply grounded in the core principles of humanistic psychology and a realistic understanding of human needs, is about **the healthy expression of needs in the service of discovering and expressing a self that works best for you.**\n\nPage 22\n\nThe good life is not something you will ever achieve. It’s a way of living.\n\n**This process won’t always bring feelings of happiness, contentment, and bliss, and it may even sometimes cause pain and heartache.**\n\n**it requires continually stretching outside your comfort zone as you realize more and more of your potentialities and launch yourself “fully into the stream of life.”**\n\n**it takes a lot of courage to become the best version of yourself.**\n\n**grow in precisely the direction you truly want to grow, in your own style, and in such a way that allows you to show the universe that you really existed, and benefited others, while you were here.**\n\nPage 24\n\n“crystallizing experience”—a memorable, dramatic moment in which we make contact with stimuli that just clicks and makes us think “Aha—that’s me!\n\nFolkways inspired Maslow to have an appreciation for cultural influences on behavior. But it also inspired him to appreciate the potent driving force of human needs. **Because the pattern of environmental contingencies differs from one society to another, different societies develop different folkways for meeting the same fundamental needs.**\n\nEvery moment brings necessities which must be satisfied at once. Need was the first experience, and it was followed at once by a blundering effort to satisfy it. . . . The method is that of trial and failure, which produces repeated pain, loss, and disappointments. Nevertheless, it is a method of rude experience and selection. The earliest efforts of man were of this kind. Need was the impelling force.\n\nMaslow was particularly impressed with the general lack of crime, violence, jealousy, and greed among the Blackfoot, along with their high levels of emotional security, firm yet caring child-rearing practices, community feeling, egalitarianism, and generous spirit. In fact, Maslow believed that the Blackfoot Indians scored so high on his tests of emotional security precisely because of their societal structure and community spirit.\n\n“wealth was not important in terms of accumulating property and possessions: giving it away was what brought one the true status of prestige and security in the tribe.”\n\nhe learned quite a bit about the First Nations perspective, including the importance of **community, gratitude for what one has, and giving back to future generations.**\n\nPage 25\n\nIt would seem that **every human being comes at birth into society not as a lump of clay to be molded by society, but rather as a structure which society may warp or suppress or build upon**. My fundamental data supporting this feeling is that my Indians were first human beings and secondly Blackfoot Indians, and also that in their society I found almost the same range of personalities as I find in our society—with, however, very different modes in the distribution curves. . . . I am now struggling with a notion of a “fundamental” [or] “natural” personality structure.\n\nhuman beings are at birth and today deep down, secure and with good self-esteem, to be analogized with the Blackfoot Indian or the chimpanzee or the baby or the secure adult. And then societies do something to this Natural Personality, twist it, shape it, repress it\n\n**cultural folkways should not be evaluated as universally “good” or “bad” but should be understood based on their adaptive value—their effectiveness in satisfying an impelling need.** Likewise, Maslow believed that **humans are basically good but that life’s pressures and frustrations make them seem otherwise.**\n\n“People are all decent underneath. All that is necessary to prove this is to find out what the motives are for their superficial behavior—nasty, mean, or vicious though that behavior may be. Once these motives are understood, it is impossible to resent the behavior that follows.”\n\nMaslow argued that **everything that is “nasty, mean, or vicious” is an overcompensatory attempt to satisfy the basic needs of security, affection, and self-esteem.**\n\npeople are good, if only their fundamental wishes are satisfied, their wishes for affection and security. **Give people affection and security, and they will give affection and be secure in their feelings and behavior.**”\n\nThe common core of this cycle is fear. Whatever the particular form it takes, some sort of fear pervades the deprivation of each of the needs that comprise this cycle.\n\n**If you have too many psychological fears, this may be an indication that you may be too caught up in securing your boat, with potentially serious consequences to actually moving along the expansive ocean.**\n\n**curb your insecurities, so that you can stand on as secure a foundation as possible and really focus on the things that give you the greatest meaning, growth, and creativity in your life.**\n\nPage 26\n\nwe have created a societal narrative around health and wellness that essentially inverts Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, placing self-actualization as a viable alternative to these fundamentals, instead of something that is built on a strong foundation of safety and security.\n\n“We are focusing on the tip of Maslow’s pyramid at the clear expense of its base.”\n\nthe need for the most fundamental needs to be met in order for one to even have the opportunity to realize their full potential.\n\n**The need for safety, and its accompanying needs for stability, certainty, predictability, coherence, continuity, and trust in the environment, is the base upon which all the others are fulfilled.**\n\nHaving a safe base allows a person to take risks and explore new ideas and ways of being, while also allowing the opportunity to become who you truly want to become. In the absence of that base, people become overly dependent on the protection, love, affection, and esteem of others, which can compromise growth, development, and meaning in life.\n\nThe need for safety is tied to a particular form of meaning in life.\n\ncoherence, purpose, and mattering\n\nPurpose involves a motivation to realize future-oriented and valued life goals. Mattering consists of the extent to which people feel that their existence and actions in the world are significant, important, and valuable.\n\nThe need for coherence is the form of meaning that is most strongly tied to the need for safety. Does my immediate environment make sense? Is there any predictability and comprehensibility in my life? Coherence is necessary to even get a chance to pursue one’s larger purpose or pursue various ways that one can matter in this world.\n\n“We need something to anchor our values upon, and when our lives feel incomprehensible, finding the things that make our lives worth living might be hard if not impossible.”\n\nPage 27\n\nThere are constructive routes to coherence.\n\ncoherence is associated with greater religiosity, spirituality, and the ability to grow from trauma\n\nBut there are also more destructive routes to coherence, and the need to regain a sense of safety can lead to aggression and antagonism. Too much chaos and unpredictability pitches us into a state that psychologists call “psychological entropy.”\n\nAll biological organisms—including humans—survive insofar as they are able to effectively manage internal entropy.\n\nIn the state of psychological entropy, we experience uncomfortable feelings such as anxiety and distress.\n\nTo be sure, there will always be a certain amount of psychological entropy in our lives: we never achieve full mastery over our environment, and things we thought we could predict are constantly changing. A certain amount of stress and unpredictability is healthy and normal.\n\n“There is a contradiction in wanting to be perfectly secure in a universe whose very nature is momentariness and fluidity.”\n\n“Uncertainty is the only certainty there is, and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security.”\n\nThe ability to reduce, manage, and even embrace uncertainty is important for everyone seeking to develop the whole person. It is critical not only to health and wellness but also to survival.\n\nPersistent fear and anxiety can have serious consequences on learning, behavior, and health.\n\nRepeated exposure to discrimination, violence, neglect, or abuse can have lifelong consequences; they alter connections in areas of the developing brain that are particularly sensitive to stress.\n\nPage 28\n\nthe system can’t perform the work at full capacity—can’t use all of its energy—when there is too much psychological entropy.\n\nAt various levels of biological functioning, our bodies are constantly attempting to minimize surprise—the experience of entropy and unpredictability—by adjusting the response to environmental input. If internal entropy levels become too great, we are forced to develop alternative strategies to minimize entropy and satisfy our basic needs. If nothing works, over time, the system fails to adapt and eventually deteriorates.\n\nThe more uncertainty we perceive in our lives, the more metabolic resources we waste and the more stress we experience. When internal disorder becomes too great, we are at risk of resorting to strategies that are destructive to others, not to mention to our whole selves. Our sense of possibility shrinks, and we are dominated by an exquisitely narrow repertoire of emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, leaving us with diminished potential to become the person we truly want to become.\n\nour psychological processes are deeply intertwined with our physiology. For that reason, I feel comfortable combining the physiological and safety needs that Maslow proposed. When safety needs are severely thwarted, people react in quite specific ways to restore balance, or homeostasis. Looking at human behavior through such a lens allows us to see maladaptive behavior nonjudgmentally yet gain a good understanding of our fellow humans.\n\nAny person at any point in time could become dominated by safety needs and would likely act in a predictable fashion in accordance with fundamental principles of human nature. When safety needs are thwarted, we lose trust in others and regard people with suspicion. We can very easily turn to destructive routes in order to regain safety, such as involvement in gangs and organized crime.\n\nPage 29\n\nHunger increases the motivation to work or pay for food, while it decreases motivation to work or pay for any kind of non-food reward.\n\nBritish psychologist Daniel Nettle contends that some behaviors commonly seen among the economically deprived—such as impulsivity, aggression, and anxiety—result more from regular hunger deprivation than from any preexisting differences among social classes.\n\nLife is best organized as a series of daring ventures from a secure base.\n\nThe human infant starts life as a totally helpless creature, completely dependent on a caregiver to get basic physiological needs met. Through the responsiveness and reliability of the caregiver, the infant develops a sense of security that needs will be met. At the same time, the infant develops an emotional attachment to the caregiver, and that bond provides a secure base and safe haven for the ever-growing infant to survive, deploy curiosity, and explore the environment.\n\nBritish psychologist John Bowlby proposed the existence of an “attachment behavioral system” designed over the eons of human history to motivate the desire to increase proximity between caregivers and vulnerable infants, children, or adults.\n\nProximity-seeking behaviors, according to Bowlby, serve the function of reducing feelings of fear and anxiety and are activated when the infant feels scared or vulnerable.\n\nwe have many unconscious drives that are encoded into our system in an if/then manner\n\nthat insight is precisely what allows us to consciously override the system and take control of our automatic habits.\n\nas children we don’t yet have the cognitive brakes of reflection that allow us to halt the attachment behavioral system.\n\nthe attachment system goes through a series of if/then questions, starting with “Is the caregiver near, attentive, and responsive?”30 If the child perceives that the answer is “yes,” she will feel loved, secure, and confident and be more likely to explore, play, and socialize with others. If the child perceives the answer to be “no,” she will experience anxiety and be more likely to show a range of behaviors designed to bring a caregiver close, including heightened vigilance and vocalizations of distress (crying).\n\nsuch behaviors would continue until the child is able to establish a comfortable level of proximity to the attachment figure. And if the attachment figure failed to respond, the child would completely withdraw, as so often happens with prolonged separation or loss.\n\nPage 30\n\nExquisitely attuned to how we are treated at times of stress, the attachment system keeps track of successes at obtaining proximity and comfort from attachment figures—beginning with parents but eventually expanding to friends and romantic partners.\n\nfrom the physical presence of the caregiver we gradually develop mental representations, or “internal working models,” of others and of the self, which allow us to forecast the behaviors of others based on prior experiences.\n\nThrough interactions with various attachment figures over the course of our lives, we develop models of the availability and sensitivity of others to our needs, as well as views of our own goodness and worthiness of love and support. These internal working models influence the expectations and beliefs we often implicitly hold of relationships more generally.\n\na nine- to twelve-month-old infant comes into the lab and after getting comfortable, is briefly separated from the parent and left alone with a stranger before being reunited with the parent.\n\nthe presence of the stranger provokes anxiety in infants, causing them to look to the parent for reassurance that everything is all right. And when the parent leaves the child alone with the stranger, children show additional distress: they appear distracted in playing with their toys or they vocalize distress. When the mother returns, most children (around 62 percent) crawl toward her, seeking to reestablish comforting proximity to the familiar caregiver.\n\nsome infants (about 15 percent) are extremely distressed by the separation, but when the caregiver returns, they crawl toward her yet resist contact—arching their back, flopping around, or otherwise signaling that they are definitely not OK with being abandoned.\n\ninsecure form of attachment. The child is not able to completely regulate and restore emotional equilibrium after having been left unprotected.\n\n“anxious-resistant attachment.”\n\n“avoidant,” among another 25 percent of the infants. These infants are clearly distressed by the separation, but when the mother returns, they behave as if they do not really need her comfort, contact, or support. It is as if they are saying, “Whatever, I don’t need you anyway.”\n\nIt is easy for me to become emotionally close to others. I am comfortable depending on them and having them depend on me. I don’t worry about being alone or having others not accept me. (Secure)\n\nI am uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I find it difficult to trust others completely or to depend on them. I worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others. (Fearful, or Fearful-avoidant)\n\nPage 31\n\nI want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close a\n\n# References",

    "content": "\nThis is the process I follow in translating [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]]'s journal entries from English to Filipino:\n\n1. I read all his journal entries for the given day. I use the one by Searls and Stilgoe. See references below.\n2. I then choose the best entry to translate and share. Some days, there will be multiple entries that are good for translation. I note all of these other entries as todos in Things. They will be translated on days when there is nothing to translate.\n3. I copy the entire original English quote into a new note. This is given a heading “Original”. Under it, I put the heading “Translation” and start translating.\n4. I will try to translate phrases, clauses, and even entire sentences by myself. When there is a challenging word, I open Google Translate to look for the most common possible translations. I don’t always use the word suggestions. Sometimes, they serve as prompts to remember a better word that I already know ([[A translator needs a personal word bank]]). The dictionary I use is: [diksiyonaryo.ph](http://diksiyonaryo.ph/), which is an incomplete online version of the UP Dictionary. I don't currently have a Filipino thesaurus. In lieu of a thesaurus, I go back and forth between Google Translate, diksiyonaryo.ph, [Merriam-Wesbter online dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/), and [Thesaurus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com/).\n5. If I am translating a difficult English word (usually, these are old words that are no longer being used today), I would first use the context to give me a sense of what Thoreau is saying ([[Translators should aspire to ask how the person they are translating used the words]]). Sometimes, this will eliminate the need to translate the difficult word per se. Other times, the difficult word is so important in the thought of the sentence or even the entire passage that it really needs to be translated. In this case, I would check the English dictionary to understand what the word really means, including its etymology if available (I use [etymonline.com](https://www.etymonline.com/). Next, I would try to use Google Translate to see if it yields translations that are close to the word's definition. If this does not produce any good suggestions, I would then use the English thesaurus to look for a better synonym, which I then translate. I would repeat this process several times until I find the best word.\n6. After translating everything, I would then go back to each translation to furnish them further.\n7. My translation process usually ends by me including a byline of Thoreau with the following format: - Henry David #Thoreau (ika-[day] ng [month], [year], [age] anyos). I only include in the IG post where it serves as a call out link to all my translations in IG.\n8. I post the translation with a photo to accompany it (usually my own photos, sometimes I pull out a photo from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)) first on IG. Then I share it publicly in Facebook.\n\nAs of 01-29-2021, all my current translations of my favorite Thoreau journal entries are rough drafts. My intention for doing them is simply to practice translating within a 30-minute period. I do not aim for perfection. I just want to establish the habit.\n\nTo do\n\n- Link your translations here.\n- Too long. There might be a way to flesh these out in individual notes.\n\n# References\n\nThoreau, H.

While I still think that the search for an accurate description of reality should always start and end within oneself, I also find that we need others to make this search sustainable. Otherwise, it can be a long lonely monologue.\n\nBut a truth partner performs an even more important role. My new friend shared me this quote from Marcus Aurelius a few weeks ago:\n\n“If anyone can refute me, show me I’m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective, I’ll gladly change. It’s the truth I’m after, and the truth never harmed anyone.”\n\nI love this so much! To achieve any success in a journey to truth, one needs to embrace this kind of humility—a humility, which in turn, encourages one to embrace openness.\n\nBut it can also feel the other way around. Maybe I know something that my truth partner would need to know. I should be ready to perform the role of an accountable honest friend who is brave enough to say when he disagrees and offer a better perspective.\n\nObviously, we are so infallible as human beings, and our efforts to share our perspective could easily lead to self-righteous criticism if we aren’t careful. That said, it is this very infallibility of our minds that necessitates dialogue. The quest for truth will only get better through talking to someone.\n\nAnd even if we come to philosophy not to understand the world or to take advantage of what Socrates called the “medicine for the soul” which philosophy provides, what better medicine can we get than a friendly conversation with an honest and kind truth seeker, perhaps late in a summer afternoon while walking and being amazed with umbrellaworts.\n\n## References\n\n[[Lilim 3 - Parenting in Nature is Our Only Chance]]",

Approximate how much time you are going to spend learning the subject or skill.\n2. Get the 10% of that approximate time and spend it on metalearning.\n\n# References\n\nYoung, S. (2019). Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career (Illustrated edition). Harper Business.\n\u003eSpend 10 percent of your total learning time to metalearning\n\u003e\n\u003eThis is the sweet spot between insufficient research and analysis paralysis. This percentage will decrease a little bit as your project scales up. You don’t have to exhaust every learning possibility. Just don’t latch onto the first possible resource or method without thinking through alternatives.\n\u003e\n\u003eBe aware of the following before starting:\n\t- common methods of learning\n\t- popular resources\n\t- tools\n\t- the strengths and weaknesses of these\n\u003e\n\u003eLong projects provide more opportunities for getting derailed and delayed, so doing proper research in the beginning can easily save a much larger amount of time later on.\n\u003e1. Spend a few hours doing more research: interview more experts, search online for more resources, search for new possible techniques.\n\u003e2. Spend a few hours doing more learning along your chosen path.\n\u003e3. Do a quick assessment of the relative value of the two activities.\n\u003e\n\u003eIf you feel as though the metalearning research contributed more than the hours spent on learning itself, you are likely at a point where more research is still beneficial.\n\u003e\n\u003eIf you felt that the extra research wasn’t too helpful, you’re probably better off sticking to the plan you had before.\n\u003e\n\u003eBe mindful of the Law of Diminishing Returns. The more time you invest in an activity (such as more research), the weaker and weaker the benefits will be as you get closer and closer to the ideal approach. If you keep doing research, eventually it will be less valuable than simply doing more learning, so at that point you can safely focus on learning.",

Tumira ako doon ng dalawang taon at dalawang buwan.

    "content": "\n# [Thu, Dec 2, 2021](day://2021.12.02)\n\nWHAT I SAW\n\nI walked at around 5:30 pm. Before leaving, the golden hour's rays penetrated the window at the office. I called Lea so I can take photos of her. It was already dark when I reached UP. I saw people all around Carabao Park, trying to protect it for a drone to move freely. It captured the lights and the belen. It was similar to last year. Little lights in the trunk, circle orbs on the branches. I walked to Forestry (Domingo M. Lantica Ave.) and stopped at this house in front of the UPLB health service. It had lights all over. But no sign of life inside. No car. Did they left? There are monoblock chairs in a room at the left side of the building's second floor. This suggests that the place might be a conference place rather than a residential place. There's no people but why leave all these lights open? I passed by a waiting shed. Lights are open for anyone to use. Empty while I was there. Welcoming. If there were chairs or a bed then I could have rested for a bit. Why are empty spaces like this alluring? Especially when the are taken cared of. Are they reminders of solitude? Perhaps all spaces are spaces of solitude. Sans people they will be silent spaces. It persuades me to conclude that spaces are essentially solo. Creation might be right and so is evolution. But whether we accept one from the other, the truth is that there was a point in the narrative when human consciousness was non existent. It was all just space alone by itself. Like the video I shot: Everything was empty space—with bugs, crickets, and the lights—until it is broken by vehicles approaching.\n\nWHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT†\n\nI thought about my writing workflow. I realized I really wanted to integrate walk into it. But I need to do so in such a way that allows me to create daily artifacts ala Thoreau, which becomes weekly articles and so on. I also thought about defining contemplation. I defined it as the lifelong pursuit to (1) savor experience and (2) cultivate the children of my mind. For the former, I use walks, photography, and narrative. For the latter, I use Talahardin. Now I was thinking about the product or service to invest in. Thoreau's diaries were his masterpiece. It was a reflection of his life. If I really want to live well, I need to use my life as the masterpiece. The artifacts to capture that will be the diary. I realized I needed a lens or purpose behind walking: To think deep about myself and the answers to the question how to live.\n\nSYNTHESIS\n\nI was empty yesterday like the house or the waiting shed. A creative rest can make you feel this way. Solitude, emptiness allows rebirth and recreation.\n\n# [Fri, Dec 3, 2021](day://2021.12.03)\n\nRoute: Ela-Oñate-Aglibut-Pili-Roxas-Viado-Juliano-Freedom Park-Royal Palm\n\nWHAT I SAW.\n\nI started walking about the same time the other day. The rout:e Mt. Data—Ruby—Bulusan—Diamond—Santos—Lopez—Ela—Onate—Aglibut—Pili—Roxas—Viado—Juliano—Freedom Park—Royal Palm—Lopez—Halcon—Ruby—Mt. Data. I tried looking for empty spaces again. Saw the waiting shed near the church at Ela. The street light created an unusual effect on my camera while at Onate. Then there's the newly built waiting shed—concrete in its glory—near Pili Drive. But the most interesting thing I saw was the effect of background lights to a slender tree in Pili when I was near Roxas. The lights were not as bright, just enough to create a shadow of the tree. The indigo sky added mystery to the scene. It was my first cold December night walk. I passed by Roxas and remembered Blanca again. Took another interesting shot of the Carillion on the background and the statues below it. The lights are really doing their job. It is as if they were installed just so we can take great photos. Another image that benefited from all the lights was this old tree along Roxas. The light illuminated its branches which are covered by green fur. The contrast between black and green is amazing. I peed for a while at the baseball field. And when I looked back, I saw that the path was alluring— the dark leaves and the bright light on the road created a mystical \"portal\" look that caught my eyes. I walked some more then took a two minute video for the oblation as it changed colors. It was a relieving cold walk. The cold breeze benefitted me immensely.\n\nWHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT\n\nWhile walking about when I took the turn from Roxas to Viado, I stopped to write these words:\n\nTo build a philosophy of living is an iterative process. You can't afford to wait for everything to be settled before you start living. You have to choose what's best among your current options. Or just start or try different options. Then you eliminate what does not resonate. I know I have written about this before. But I am reminded of it because of something that Frederick Ross said in his interview at The Guardian. Writing a book about walking is some sort of obstacle to just living. Well, I don't totally agree with that. I still think that the best way to live is to combine the two simultaneously—to think about life and live at the same time, to inform one with the other. But Gross was right to suggest that living should take priority over everything else. If studying prevents me from living, then it hasn't done its job. I think so I can add better and be present better and feel better.\n\nAside from this, I continued studying Talahardin development. I continued to dilineate notes about Zettelkasten, Evergreen notes, and Talahardin. I realized I could adopt literature notes about the former two to recreate them as an integral part of Talahardin.\n\n# [Mon, Dec 6, 2021](day://2021.12.06)\n\nRoute: Ela-Pili-Viado-Velasco\n\nWHAT I SAW\n\nI left the house at arouns 5:15. I walked up Data and entered Sierra Madre just to break the monotony. I saw a cat peacefully napping at the front gate of a house. I hesitated to take a photo of it but walked back to do so. A really small letter tube hanged on a gate with a house that didn't seem liveable yet. And then there was that cute dog that didn't bark at me when I stopped to take a picture of it. It even started wagging its tail. A sign of friendliness. I squatted to take a video of it and it continued to wag its tail. I wanted to believe it opened its mouth to smile. The line of cosmos flowers outside the fence of a house was gone. They left a single bush of the plant.\n\nAt UP, I walked to Ela-Pili-Viado-Velasco. There was an event in Carabao Park. A few outsiders were trying to enter, they were not allowed. Perhaps they wanted to hang out in Carabao Park, it was still before 6 pm but there is an event, so perhaps that is why they were not allowed.\n\nI wanted to walk at Velasco first but I decided to avoid the hassle and walked towards Pili via Ela. It was not a very centering walk. There were no big realizations. It was too dark to take good photos.\n\nWHAT I THOUGHT\n\nI listened to two episodes of the podcast 70 by 70 while cooking.\n\n# [Tue, Dec 7, 2021](day://2021.12.07)\n\nWHAT I SAW\n\nI went out at around 5:30 pm once again. I meant to go out earlier but it was raining and I sprayed the office with anti-flea spray.\n\nJust outside the door, this came to me and I wrote it down:\n\n\u003e Walking is not the point.\n\n\u003e The point is whatever that state of mind you want to achieve.\n\n\u003e Contemplation.\n\n\u003e Meditation.\n\n\u003e Zettelkasten.\n\n\u003e These are all tools.\n\n\u003e Walking is a tool.\n\n\u003e I don't want to put unnecessary emphasis on a tool.\n\n\u003e What has to be emphasized is the state of mind - repeated and it becomes a lifestyle.\n\nBy 6 pm I was at the Belen. There were no events so I decided to walk there. While taking a photo of the fountain, a woman approached me and asked for me to take a picture of them. I said sure and turned around only to see that it was Ate Peachy. Chichi was there too. Probably their entire research team. I said hi but made my way. I saw that there was a bazaar in front Devcom. There seems to be people at the entrance. Perhaps requiring vaccination card? So I didn't enter. I walked at Capinpin and saw that I can actually enter at the back of the bazaar and won't be noticed. Next time. I didn't have much time.\n\nI walked on the dim lighted mini park beside SESAM.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image.jpeg)\n\nThe yellow light made me think about depression and how it has provided a lens for me to see the world and do art. I wrote these words:\n\n\u003e I realized later on that if you have a strong propensity towards experiencing sadness, being alone, you can either get too much carried away by it. I got too much carried away by it early in my life. But what I realized that once I have established a more robust support system (partner, family, friends, community), I can dip myself in sadness, loneliness, drama, stuff pop culture call emo, but being able to get back to light.\n\n\u003e And part of this process is presence. If I am present to the experience, I know that it won't last. That I am intentionally entering it to create art. It is simply a transient experience and I can always choose to get off it. I am no longer engulfed by darkness. I could never return to depression.\n\nI continued walkind towards Aglibut then Velasco and turned left on Narra towards Forestry. I took the usual route I take when I walk here. Insects were again making loud noises at that part of the walk. The same place I took the video in.\n\nThere were scattered rains while I was walking. Back at Royal Palm, two gents walked pass me in a hurry. It started raining and their hurry made sense. They had no umbrella. They watched me from a waiting shed as I passed by.\n\nI bought brown rice and nips before heading back home.\n\n# [Wed, Dec 8, 2021](day://2021.12.08)\n\nRoute: IRRI Housing\n\nWHAT I SAW AND THOUGHT ABOUT\n\nI went out a few minutes past 5. I walked at Bulusan St. A grandma and her apo were walking alongside me. They walked as if the entire street was theirs.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(2).jpeg)\n\nAt UP, more and more people can be seen at Carabao Park. The lights of the Belen were not yet on, but people were flocking. Some parents let their kids down the dried up pond. If there is anything this showed me, it is that people are willing to risk everything for the sake of freedom.\n\nI discovered new angles and shots not by changing routes but by exploring the spaces between those routes.\n\nI walked towards IRRI housing. The original plan was to walked towards the stream. However, it was already dark, and I wanted to get at Diwa by 6 pm so I don't get home too late.\n\nSo I just walked towards near the gate of IRRI housing. The walk going back when the road is slightly tilted was amazing. I can see the darkness below as I go down. A man walking emerged from this darkness. And then there was the walk under bamboos. I realized that this was the only part of UP I discovered so far with bamboos. Probinsya feels. The creeking sound is alluring. I was grateful for walking here.\n\nI went to Diwa, met Janges, drank ginger tea, and went home by 7.\n\nI am having second thoughts about starting Lilim this early. I think I need to stick to my original plan. Or at least prioritize the metalearning project. This is because I need to think about how I show up. This is part of the research. And I can do this with more focus if I dont worry too much about others.\n\n# [Thu, Dec 9, 2021](day://2021.12.09)\n\nRoute: Ela-Pila-Argañosa-Madamba\n\nFIELD NOTES\n\nWhen I got out the door, I saw Ate Peachy and greeted her. She said, talagang araw-araw kang naglalakad ah. I was surprised. Someone noticed I walk daily. I said syempre and chatted with her some more about the people she was with the other night when I saw her. Then I went off.\n\nIt was late. Around 5:38. I arrived at UP only to see that too many people have flocked around the belen. Some were sitting on the stairs in front of it. The belen does not light up until 6 I guess. And so people can now stay there past 6. People increase by the day at the belen and UP in general.\n\nI walked at Ela to Pili and thought about how complicated owning a house is. The maintenance that gets with it and the money you need to do maintenance. I am also second-guessing whether to continue living here when the contract expires. The house is too large and there is space I'm not really using. A large house needs more time and money to maintain. And since I am alone, that means all those resources rests on my shoulder. A few things are stopping me from leaving, however: relatively good neighbors, quiet neighboorhood (until now), almost no one burning. One can never be sure if I can find a similar neighborhood.\n\nFrom Pili, I turned to Argañosa towards Madamba. Several vehicles and a motorcycle entered the gate at DTRI, always stopping for a few seconds before entering. I didn't see anyone at the gate when I turned on the corner.\n\nMadamba is lighted but so quiet at this time.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(3).jpeg)\n\nVery much unlike Doc Jen lol.\n\nWhile walking I reminded myself that I need to sleep earlier. Also, I need to stop relying on the bread boys for my merienda. I should just buy bread and jam like before to save time.\n\nI smelled cut wood. I saw cut lumber at the middle and side of the road. Were these newly cut or not? If not, the smell of wood has persisted.\n\nFrom afar, I saw a dog in the middle of the street, lighted by one of the street lights. As I approached nearer, it started barking on me. I picked my umbrella out of my bag's pocket and prepared to engage. Then a lady entered from nowhere. She was carrying what looked like a pan on her hand and a spoon maybe. Then she started calling Choco! Choco! The dogs recognized her voice and approached her. She fed two dogs then moved on and continued calling Choco! Choco! Looks like Choco is playing hard to get.\n\nI forgot to look back at Choco and the lady. I think I was just feeling so grateful that the she arrived. I could enjoy my walk and not feel anxious about three dogs barking and following me!\n\nI looked up and saw the moon and remembered why I like to walk. I walk not for culture m but for nature, and for the big questions it inspires me to ask and the comfortable environment it creates for me to think about these questions.\n\nI turned at Viado. A woman was waiting alone outside the gate of a building. I went out to Freedom Park via Roxas.\n\nWhile going down Roxas, I realized I engage with information very slowly. I have been processing Talahardin notes for a few months now and am far from done. This is all the more reason that I need to spend time with meta-learning. I need to dedicate my time on only the best books and materials on a topic.\n\nWhile at the middle of Freedom Park walking on the grass, I mistook the garbage cans as people sitting from afar.\n\nA patroling officer on a motorcycle passed by. I notice that patroling officers are no longer as many as before.\n\nAt Royal Palm, I stopped at the bridge to write these words:\n\n\u003e Translation is another one of those activities that hits multiple birds with one stone. When translating, you engage with a text to really understand it therefore increasing your grasp of it. You also increase your mastery of the origin language as well as the target language. You also increase your familiarity of the tools you use for translation.\n\nAnd that is a reason I need to contemplate going back to translating Thoreau.\n\nFlowers fell down a palm as I passed by.\n\nI walked out of the gate after passing people at the Belen.\n\n# [Fri, Dec 10, 2021](day://2021.12.10)\n\nRoute: Batis\n\nNARRATIVE\nIt was a little uninspiring at home after lunch. I wanted to do another work session on the desk but the motivation just wasn’t there. So, I took a bath and decided to leave by 2:30 to go to Diwa’s house to buy cat food and sit the kitties. I wanted to pass by Raymundo gate but the pet food store was out of way, so I had to pass by UP gate. Good that I did, I saw the lotus (or are they lily pads?) I think they are lotuses. There arre maybe 6-8 of them in the pool (I think) different from where the fountain is. If I am not mistaken, this is the same pool all dried up the other day where kids went down to play. Or maybe not. Maybe I am mistaken. These lotus plants seem mature. Perhaps they were here all along since a few weeks ago. I can see that there are pots submerged under water and the leaves just sprung out of these pots.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(4).jpeg)\n\nI walked towards the library, went down to Velasco and walked pass a sitting guard. We saw eye to eye. Then I turned towards Bella Cartash. A sign was hung. Apartment for rent it said. I stayed at Diwa’s place feeding and playing with the cats for about an hour and a half. Then I went out to walk towards batis. It was already about 5:30 when I did that. I wanted to catch the path when there is still some light available since there are no street lights there at Drilon Jr.\n\nWhile in Camia, I saw two cats at the middle of the road. It’s a mother and its child. They look a lot like each other especially their tails. They were short like Shorty. It was so cute I had to take a photo of it. They were startled when I approached so they went under the nearest car. That’s where I took a photo of them. Unfortunately, their tails can’t be seen. Well, they’re too short to be seen anyway.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(5).jpeg)\n\nI also took a photo of a street light. I turned left and saw three elderly people talking and seem to watch. Where they watching the whole time?\n\nWhile passing by the triangle intersection of Drilon Jr. and Gapud, I started asking myself:\n\nHow do I want to spend my days?\n\nMy time on earth is too limited. Something must give for me to focus on what I want most to do.\n\nI answered a partial yet authentic list:\n\n- Longer walks for sure.\n- Thought-provoking reads.\n- Interesting yet challenging conversations.\n\nI could spend every day just doing these three.\n\nAt batis, I immediately noticed that the road was wider than before. The whole time I wasn’t able to visit this place, which I once dubbed similar to my favorite route back in Sta. Maria, people were already developing it. Will there be a chance that this opens up as an alternate route for cars. There is. Otherwise, why would they spend money on it just to be walked on by people like me? This means, this could be a busy road one of these days, no longer as friendly to the cause of solitude.\n\nIt was really dark, but it was 6 pm anyways and at this time of the year, this can be expected. The half moon though was bright enough to give me some light. I saw a tempory tent shed on the left with chairs under it. Workers took a break here perhaps, or where they guard houses? I thought someone was there. But who would stay here alone at this time? Just me.\n\nI walked up until I saw the wall on the left that signals an assault that goes directly towards houses. I then turned to go back. I had to return to Diwa’s house to fix the door that won’t lock. Along the way, I saw several fireflies that stopped blinking when I tried to video them.\n\nAs I approached the triangle again, I was greeted by another lonely comrade. A waiting shed waiting under a friendly light.\n\nNight walks are surprisingly full of imagery.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(6).jpeg)\n\nFIELD NOTES\n\nHow do I want to spend my days?\n\nMy time on earth is too limited. Something must give for me to focus on what I want most to do.\n\nLonger walks for sure.\n\nThought-provoking reads.\n\nInteresting yet challenging conversations.\n\nThey extended the road at batis\n\nThe half moon is bright as is.\n\nA lone firefly\n\n# [Sun, Dec 12, 2021](day://2021.12.12)\n\nRoute: Ela-Pili-Roxas-Viado-Pancho-Freedom Park-Royal Palm\n\nNarrative\n\nI went out around 5:30 pm. It was starting to get dark. Brought my laundry first at Ressie's then I started my way to UP. Lots of people were at Grove. UP has turned into a place of pilgrimage. The last time I saw this many people that behaved this way was the last Sunday I ever went to Manaoag before the pandemic. I saw a family who brought four dogs, I think. All small toys. One of them didn't want to walk. It just sat there. Its master carried it instead until gate. He tried to make it walk once more. When it still didn't, he started dragging it, forcing it to walk. Its probably a stressful place to bring dogs to. I know I won't bring Chikako with me to a similar place.\n\nBefore I entered UP, I saw Ju. We stared at each other for a long time then realized this is us. I touched his left nipple, which later led to jokes with the gang.\n\nWhen I entered UP, a question came to me: No one has ever answered this to me yet clearly. Why does one need to work in public? I mean, we always have the choice to work behind close doors. So why do some choose to get out there?\n\nI walked at Ela to avoid people only to see how much people were attending the mass. Good thing there were inside the church and not on the streets. It was dark already.\n\nA boy stood at the gate of the church with eyes closed, head bowed, singing behind his mask, or fervently praying. An older boy, who was probably his companion, wasn't sharing his religiosity.\n\nI turned right on Pili after I saw a group of friends or family who were walkind towards me. I reached Roxas and took one of only two photos I took for this cold evening walk.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(7).jpeg)\n\nIt was here I think when I remembere my meandering answer to the wonderful question Maui asked--what is Los Baños for you? Aside from not getting to the point, I felt compelled to use the word \"spirituality\", which is uncharacteristic of me.\n\nI know I am not being honest and articulate when I am forced to utter something that isn't true for me but sounds right for others.\n\nI am too polite for a philosopher.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(8).jpeg)\n\nI walked at Viado. The only person I saw while there was the lady guard inside her small shed.\n\nI exited at Pancho then walked at Freedom Park. While in Freedom Park I realized that to organize my notes on the Talahardin system, I can simply go back to my workshop on life management system and use the structure there. That is what I am going to do today.\n\nFIELD NOTES\n\nNo one has ever answered this to me yet clearly. Why does one need to work in public?\n\nFlocks of people attending the mass\n\nA boy stands at the gate eyes closed, head bowed, singing behind his mask, fervently praying.

The sun was still up. I was about to take the usual route to UP via Bulusan or Banahaw, but I realized I might be able to buy yogurt so I walked at Diamond to Halcon then Lopez to go to Ate Grace's. There was a single bottle left. I bought it. Frome there, I walked towards UP.\n\nThe canvas tent where people pass under has been disassembled. I walked via Carabao Park, where people started flocking in. I saw that the Belen wasn't on lights yet even if it was already about 6. I also learned that the public is actually open to view the display until 10.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(9).jpeg)\n\nI continued walking towards library. A family was walking at the other side of the road. They might be going to freedom park. An officer stopped them.\n\nFrom library, I walked Narra and crossed the bridge. I saw a good angle and took several photos.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(10).jpeg)\n\nIt was still bright when I walked up Lantican. Many vehicles were pasing by.\n\nIt was dark when I reached the forestry area. I saw an officer resting in the shed at the intersection of Lantican and Pancho. I continued walking, saw a good spot to pee across the road so I did it. Then I made my way across the arc to forestry.\n\nThe walk was dark, with the sounds on cicadas filling the air.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(11).jpeg)\n\nI had very little thoughts in this walk. I was just grateful to walk here again.\n\nBut I did remembered the GIGO principle and realized its relevance to spending enough time in metalearning mode. Nailing metalearning assures you that you only consume the best of the best.\n\nI walked back to do some errands before coming back home.\n\n**Field notes**\n\nGarbage in, garbage out\n\n- More time spent identifying what to put in will make sure something good gets out\n\n# [Thu, Dec 16, 2021](day://2021.12.16)\n\nMt. Data-Sierra Madre Ext.-Sierra Madre-Onyx-Santos-Lopez-Ela-Pili Drive\n\nNarrative\n\nI went out around 5 pm. Late again because I vacuumed the house. I wanted to eat some streetfood first before walking so I decided to go to Ate Dhel’s Proven. So I walked there by taking the Sierra Madre route (just to avoid the annoying tricycle drivers). I passed by a pile of garbage beside the house with two large German shepherds. It was a photo find.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(12).jpeg)\n\nI notice that what you’ll find in people’s garbage piled might be a good photography project.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(13).jpeg)\n\nAte Dhel’s was close. I looked for other places to eat at the area but there was none. So I started walking Santos to go to Lopez where there are some street food vendors. I crossed the street and saw one. My gally, I saw Ju once more! Second time in a single week! I asked him where he was going and why he was early. He said this was the regular meeting time at Satya. I said I’ll go ahead, waited for him to vanish, then went to the streetfood stall to order tokneneng and isaw. A dog was moving around looking up at customers waiting for whatever food he can get. He had a damaged right eye. I looked at his other good eye. I felt pity. I bought two more isaw. The other one, I am sure I fed him most of it. I wasn’t enough. But he has the look in his eye that he have been living like this for a while and he will find a way to survive. I saw that look again after seeing him outside Savemore, after buying some groceries. He was walking, staunch, perhaps going to his next spot. He knows the streets.\n\nI continued to UP. At Ela, on the pedestrian lane going towards the church, a boy walked slowly at the lane while raising his hand in a stop position. He continued doing this until he and her guardian reached the other side. As I passed by the church, I heard a young girl reciting prayers. I sat at a bench for a while.\n\nWhile walking towards Pili Drive, I noticed the constant appearance of people and cars on my walk. I realized that the presence of people along the way while walking has an effect on whether walking changes one’s perspective. It seems that solitude heightens these changes as well as the length of the walk and thus of solitude.\n\nI looked at the moon. It was almost full. I have a history of looking at the moon and realizing something. As I looked at it behind a thin sheet of cloud, I remembered Nietszche and how wrong he is. How can something so beautiful not truly exist? I feel like by saying that metaphysics is wrong, he is doing metaphysics.\n\nAll of these reminded me that the problems of philosophy are not that hard to understand. They are only made complex by the personality of philosophers and the world they revolve around.\n\nI also remembered the Nietszche podcast I listened to in the morning. The host was a fan of the philosopher—thinks he is part of the new race of philosophers that love freedom. However, doesn’t mean that an idea that is radical, rebelious, convenient, and beautiful is true. An idea can be so old, so conservative, so boring, ugly, but still be true.\n\nI practiced walking better by noticing the different changes of perspective that walking makes possible. I looked at the moon and noticed how I approached it. I looked at the tree and did the same. I noticed how people approaching affected me or how the wideness of the terrain affected me.\n\nThis noticing of the environment and just being and then stopping for a while to jot some fieldnotes made me realize that walking is a dance between being and thinking and being while thinking.\n\nAfter reaching the last light post, I started walking back. There, I saw the shadow of Makiling. It was already dark, but I could still see that the peak is hidden behind a low thick cloud.\n\nWhile walking back, I felt some gratitude that the Philippines is actually doing better in terms of respecting people’s freedom while rolling out the vaccines. I also articulated the difference of insight and conclusion. Insight is thought that is not born out of another thought. It can be part of a thread of thought, but there is always a space between the thread and the insight. A conclusion is directly connected to a set of prepositions, which can only be deduced through careful analysis. An insight can be a conclusion to a thread of thought, but its coming is surprising, takes time, happens at unexpected moments as if it comes from somewhere else and not the author.\n\nFieldnotes\n\n- Met Ju twice.\n- Fed a dog.\n- A boy wanted to stop a car while crossing pedxing.\n- A young girl reciting prayers at the church.\n- The presence of people along the way whole walking has an effect on whether walking changes ones perspective.

One can say it is triggered by something, but that something is not information.\n   - There might always be role that physical world or movement plays.\n   - Insight could happen as part of a thread of thought. But it isn't clear how it is related to the thread.\n   - A conclusion however scaffolds on initial thoughts and can only be generates by analyzing those thoughts together.\n\n# [Fri, Dec 17, 2021](day://2021.12.17)\n\nRoute: Tadlac Lake\n\nNarrative\n\nYesterday was the day I formally cut ties with Accuweather. It told me the rain is going to stop in 38 minutes. This convinced me to put my doubts away about going out for a walk on this rainy weather, close the door, and leave. And it wasn’t just a normal walk. It was a half-day walk to Alligator lake.\n\nIt was difficult to walk along Mt. Data on my way to Agapita. Submerged parts of the road were filled with water, and since the area was quite elevated, water was rushing down on some parts. A bad time and place to walk. But I continued. Everything will be better when I ride the jeep, and in 38 minutes, the rain will stop. Or so I believe, because Accuweather told me.\n\nIt was a mindful walk going to Lopez to ride the jeep~~—~~absorbing despite the rain. Or was it absorbing because of the rain?\n\nSide note: Saw it just now. There is in fact a Mt. Pulog, contrary to what Ome said that this should have been Mt. Pulag. And what is ironic is that Mt. Pulog is in Sorsogon. And Ome is a Bicolano. Haha.\n\nI was expecting water to enter the soles of my shoes. But I felt none. Was it my socks? Thicker ones are probably ensulating me from the wet. I entered the jeep. Only four of us were there includung the driver. A long queue of vehicles stopped on the other side of the road going to Sta. Cruz. From Olivarez, where the jeep stopped, to Bagong Kalsada, it would be an 9 min ride. Double that for traffic and stops. I transferred sit at the end of the jeep where rainwater is moistening my left leg as we wait at Olivarez Plaza. It was 2:09 pm.\n\nWe arrived at Bagong Kalsada at 2:25 pm. My theory was correct. I got of the jeep with the rain really pouring hard. Contrary to Accuweather’s prediction, the rain doesn’t seem to be stopping any time now. Surprisingly, the moment I took shade, the rain started to weaken. I bought two pieces of bread—pande coco and spanish—then started walking Bagong Kalsada towards Tadlac. I passed by a busy talipapa at the entrance. I bet people could buy most of their needs here.\n\nI stopped for a while and typed these words:\n\n\u003e I am an artist writer than a researcher. An everyday literary philosopher rather than an anlaytical one. I ought to publish just to practice publishing and sharing my thoughts.\n\nI later learned that I was in Masili, a barangay of Calamba, in Real district.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(14).jpeg)\n\nIt started raining hard again. Unfortunately, my umbrella, the only thing protecting me from drops of rain I wasn't expecting to be these large, had some holes in it. I stopped inside a shade shaped like an umbrella but metal. The irony.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(15).jpeg)\n\nI waited inside the umbrella for a couple of minutes before continuing the route. This was my route going to the lake.\n\n![Tadlak Lake Route 1.png](Walk%20narratives.assets/Tadlak%20Lake%20Route%201.png)\n\nBagong Kalsada was filled with resorts on both sides. Some are not so obvious. I think they are just piggy banking on the success of nearby pansol and the resorts in Los Baños. Some of these resorts are almost hidden inside guarded subdivisions. Construction continues in one of these resorts—a sign that business is okay, or perhaps recovering, despite the lockdowns.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(16).jpeg)\n\nWhen I arrived at the corner of Bagong Kalsada and Tadlac, I was surprised to see a railroad. I thought I will be walking on the rails going towards the lake or perhaps riding trolleys. It was a relief to see that a cemented road for cars was just beside the rails. I turned right and started walking Tadlac.\n\nWalking on Tadlac street felt like walking in Rizal in the streets beside the rails, except there are no trolleys.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(17).jpeg)\n\nAlong the street, the side of the road started to ascend, houses start to descend, and the mountain—great Mt. Makiling is revealed.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(18).jpeg)\n\nI saw a signboard about the lake. Tadlac Lake is its name. Why is Google maps calling it alligator lake? Tadlac is, in fact, a barangay of Los Baños. So Masili and Tadlac are the border barangays of Elbi and Calamba.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(19).jpeg)\n\nAs I got deeper in Tadlac, I noticed signs of the pandemic—writings on the walls on the side of the road reminding people of curfew hours, community gardens perhaps built to address hunger, and the biggest surprise of all an isolation facility at the heart of the barangay.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(20).jpeg)\n\nAs I was about to make a left turn going up towards the lake, the rain started pouring really hard. This was the most challenging part of the walk. I had to contend with my feelings. I felt swindled by Accuweather. I was starting to call the walk a bad idea. To make matters worse, there were almost no place to take shade. I saw a closed store with just a little shade. I took shelter. By this time, I can already feel my socks squishy with rain water. My shoes are already three years old, battered by long walks, and are no longer waterproof. I am but an amateur walker. But in hindsight, this was a good educational experience on the importance of waterproofing when walking and choosing the best gear to walk with.\n\nIt was raining hard it was difficult to write anything down on my phone (waterproofing phones are also important in these situations) or to check where I was already. I knew I was near the lake. But the other lake, Laguna de bay, emerged first, although it was gray with rain clouds.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(21).jpeg)\n\nThe rain continued pouring but I knew I was near so I continued. I passed by a man sitting on a shed then a concrete stairs where water flowed down. I saw Tadlac lake there for the first time but never thought that was the viewdeck. I continued walking only to realize the view of the lake will be gone soon. I checked the map and I did passed the viewdeck. I hesitated to go back. I thought the viewdeck was where the man was sitting on. I don’t want to share it with him. But I remembered how hard it was to walk here on this weather, how I will waste all of that if I don’t commune with the lake. So I went back, prepared to talk with the man. Then that’s when I saw that the stairs going down, where the water flowed, was the viewdeck.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(22).jpeg)\n\nBut will I go down? Brown water from the road above is flowing down hard, torrential. Hell, my feet are already soaked. What’s the difference? So I went down. Walked slowly, lest I slip. And that was when I finally got really close to the lake. It was magical.\n\nI finally arrived at the lake after much difficulty. Particularly on my feet. I arrived at around 3:30 pm. I saw some herons perched up some trees. Some flew above the lake. There were also small wild ducks swimming at the edges of the water. I saw some kingfishers, small blue ones like those in Lobong. I stood under the shade of a large tall tree, it was still raining, and I ate the bread I bought at the bakeshop.\n\nThen about that time, it stopped raining. My goodness. It stopped. And that’s when I realized it was actually a good idea to walk at this time—no people, just me, the view of the lake and the mountain while raining was a different view. I could visit this lake anytime when the sun is up but not when it is raining like this. And perhaps the biggest realization of all: This was probably the longest I have been around nature since my escapades at Lobong CIS.\n\n![Image.jpeg](Walk%20narratives.assets/Image%20(23).jpeg)\n\nI decided to stay in the lake for at least an hour. To stay and appreciate nature. I took photos, watched the birds through my binoculars, and took two videos.\n\nWith all these beauty, I realized that Lilim has to be written. I will start doing a bi-weekly publication. While not publishing, I’ll just pile up the walking writings and publish them when I am ready. This was a motivating factor to fix website\n\n**Fieldnotes**\n\nRaining. Difficult to walk along Data to Agapita. But it was a mindful walk, absorbing despite the rain. Or was it absorbing because of the rain?\n\nI was expecting water to enter the soles of my shoes. But I can't feel any. Was it my socks? Thicker ones are probably ensulating me from the wet. I enter the jeep. Only four of us here includung the driver. Traffic to sta cruz. But because of stoplight. From here to Bagong Kalsada, it would be an 9 min ride. Plus another of that for traffic and stops. I transfer sit at the end of the jeep where rainwater is moistening my left leg as we wait at Olivarez Plaza. 2:09 pm.\n\n2:25 arrived at bagong kalsada. Rain stopped bothering me.\n\nI am an artist writer than a researcher. An everyday literary philosopher rather than an anlaytical one. I ought to publish just to practice publishing and sharing my thoughts.\n\nUnfortunately, my umbrella, the only thing protecting me from drops of rain I wasn't expecting to be these large, had some holes in it. I stopped inside a shade shaped like an umbrella but metal. The irony.\n\nArrived at the lake with much difficulty. Particularly on my feet. I was here around 3:30. There are some herons perched up some trees. Some are flying above the lake. Some small wild ducks are swimming at the edges. I saw some kingfishers. This is probably the longest i have been around nature since my lake at lobong.\n\nLilim has to be written. Even as a biweekly or monthly publication. Just pile up the walking writings. Publish them biweekly when they are ready.\n\nWild ducks fly across the lake but just right over the water. Its funny to watch.\n\nNature does not discriminate - in both its goodness and badness.\n\n",

    "content": "\nI start walking the slightly inclined Mt. Data Street and immediately felt how this day is different than all the others that came before it. The sky is dimmer, the air colder. From afar, I saw two women get off a vehicle and enter the home of Chewy (dark brown Shitzu) and Mia (Chihuahua). The dogs live with a couple. Perhaps these are visitors.\n\nJust pass them, I saw the sad beagle, Trixie, stand. The gate toward its cage is open and he seems either provoked or excited. He started barking. A slight joy leaped out of my heart. I realize how I was used to seeing her lie down in her cage all day. But this day is different from all the other days that came before it.\n\nMt. Data Street is filled with vehicles. Several turn left to Sierra Madre Street Extension. I am careful not to block the way.\n\nOn this strip of improvised roadway, a large temporary tent stands. Under it, several old men and women play cards. No one was dead. People just need to get out of their poorly ventilated homes.\n\nI enter Raymundo Gate with a little indecisiveness on where to go next. I walk at Jose R. Velasco Avenue and follow the path around the library. When I pass by a couple sitting on the stairs, they suddenly stop talking.",

Gros says: “You don’t walk to kill time but to welcome it, to pick off its leaves and petals one by one, second by second.\"\n\nFor a walk to allow you to do this, bring only what is “essential” in walks. Do not bring anything with you, physical or material, that derails you from living in the moment. Leave anything that reinforces social calculation (i.e., comfort or style).\n\nBut there is a deeper level of presence that can be achieved by leaving behind even what feels “necessary” (i.e., equiplments to cope with weather, etc.). When you let go of even the necessary, you start to commune with your primitive self.  In this state, you are relieved of even the duty of self-preservation. You completely surrender to nature.\n\n# References\n\nGros, F. (2014). A Philosophy of Walking. Verso.\n\n\u003e To walk without even the necessary is to *abandon yourself* to the elements. When you do that, nothing counts any more, plans, self-assurance, nothing. Nothing but a full and wholesale trust in the world’s generosity.\n\n\u003e By abandoning ourselves to it we gain a previously unknown confidence which satisfies the heart, because it makes us totally dependent on an Other, relieving us even of the duty of self-preservation. The elemental is that to which we entrust ourselves, and which is given to us in its entirety. But to experience its texture we have to take a risk, the risk of going beyond the necessary.\n\n",

I was glad—very glad—that I heard waves again, that I felt that strong wind once more, that I saw the sunset in its most majestic form. But I was also deeply saddened because I realized that I felt, for the first time in what seems like a very long time, the emotions that the pandemic has deprived me—emotions I didn’t even know I was looking for.\n\nIsolation may indeed be saving our lives, but that kind of life we are saving is not a full life. A full life needs the outdoors. And even if I was already frequently outdoors during the quarantines, I now see that those were not enough. Mountains, seas, roads, ridges—they’re all waiting for us.\n\nDuring the old normal, it was already too difficult for many of us to see the beauty that is always around us. The pandemic did not make that any easier.\n\nIt did not just isolate us from each other.

Just as writing allows one to read the words of someone who is absent, so roads make it possible to trace the route of the absent...To write is to carve a new path through the terrain of the imagination, or to point out new features on a familiar route...So stories are travels and travels are stories.” (p. 72)\n\n$ You have to find ideas about the concepts you are working at from others but also present your own conceptions.

Their walks were essentially private excursions to self-discovery. However, their residues entered the public sphere where they invite others to follow. They served as archetypes and models that break people's reliance on commerce and culture. [[thoughts/the inward morning by bugbee|The Inward Morning]] is what Bugbee uses to refer to this inner breaking of our reliance to commerce and culture. This breaking reveals how we are connected to the rest of [[Nature]] and brings life to our wilderness within, which interestingly allows us to tolerate and find meaning in civilization. The inward morning happens through continuous [[thoughts/walking]] (see [[Walking changes your perspective]]; [[Walking could break your sense of identity]]).\n\nIf I am to follow the path of the people whom I say inspire me, it is inevitable that I go against the night. Almost all of them were brave enough to live their truth and know their authentic selves and by doing so serve as role models to all of us who are afraid to listen to ourselves and do what we know is right. How do I show courage? How do I respond to the call of the wild?\n\nThis line of thought inspired me to write the poem [[ang unang liwayway]].\n\n## References\n\nConway, D. W. (1999).

It does so by the following:\n\n- Climbing: While one climbs, one uses and develops persistence. This quality is highly valuable when cultivating novel ideas.\n- Elevation: Atop a mountain or a hill, one sees things in a bird’s eyeview. One becomes detached to things. This perspective helps us see the connections between details and construct a big picture look at reality.\n- Movement: While walking, movement stimulates thinking. The quality of these thoughts are subtly different from thoughts brought about by other thoughts (See [[Words written outdoors vs indoors]]).\n- Surprise: Secret discoveries or unexpected surprises also changes one’s perspective.\n- Time: [[Walking lengthens time]]\n- Space: [[Walking deepens space]]\n- Wideness: Walking in a narrow trail is different from walking in a wide open space.\n\nHowever, I notice that the presence of people along the way while walking has an effect on whether walking changes ones perspective . It seems that solitude heightens these changes as well as the length of the walk and thus of solitude.\n\n# References\n\nGros, F. (2014). A Philosophy of Walking.

Here is thought about the thing itself, without the scrambling, the fogginess, the barriers, the customs clearances of culture and tradition.\n\n\u003e The climbing body demands effort; it is under continuous tension. It is an aid to thought in the pursuit of examination: pushing on a little further, a little higher. It’s important not to weaken, but to mobilize energy to advance, to place the foot firmly and hoist the body slowly, then restore balance. So with thought: an idea to rise to something even more astonishing, unheard-of, *new*. And then again: it is a matter of gaining altitude.\n\n\u003e for thinking one needs a detached outlook, to be at a distance, to have clear air. One needs to be unconstrained to think far. And what then do details, definitions, exactitudes mean? It is the armature of human destiny that one needs to see laid out. From very high up one sees the movement of landscapes, the design of hills.\n\n\u003e Many aphorisms are built on these reversals of perspective, these final exclamations where something else is unveiled, the secret of a discovery like a new landscape, and the jubilation that accompanies it.\n\n",

I’m starting to see that its very nature is that of a guide that tells you how to walk but never when to arrive.\n\u003e\n\u003ePursuing this question has inspired me to write hundreds of [essays](https://vinceimbat.com/tags/essays/) and journal entries and to draw landscapes and take  [photographs](https://www.instagram.com/vinceimbat) to document and remember what I have seen.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe question has taught me that to try to discern what it means to live as a human being involves not only thinking about life but, perhaps more importantly, experiencing it and finding answers in the real world—outdoors.",

Many have similar ideas about what is “bad” or “good.”\n\nWhere we often disagree is on the level of [[thoughts/metaphysics]]: on what exists. For example, some people believe in [[thoughts/god]] while others don't. Conflict on this foundational level gives rise to conflict on the level of actions and behaviors.\n\nDisagreement in metaphysics is also highly connected with disagreement in [[epistemology]]. For example, a person who believes in God is more likely to believe in the divine inspiration of sacred scriptures. An atheist will, in turn, find it difficult to believe on divine inspiration by virtue of their disbelief in a divine author.\n\nBecause it can be divisive and prevent people from being kind to each other, the [[The Buddha avoided metaphysics]]. This problem actually forced me to ask whether I do philosophy to live a good life or to prove that I am right ([[thoughts/philosophize to live deliberately]]).\n\n",

    "content": "\nSafe spaces can sometimes keep us from being brave.\n\nBeing very supportive of each other's choices and paths can make us feel reluctant to ask each other hard questions or challenge unhealthy patterns. This can make growth and healing difficult.\n\nPoliteness can create a safe space but not a brave space.\n\nWhen a space is too safe and we’ve become comfortable in that safety, we don’t want to challenge it, we don’t want to say anything that will rock the boat, and we don’t want to offend anyone else lest they abandon us. One of the results is that we become reluctant to be too vulnerable because our shadows might scare the other people away. We choose comfort over courage and we chase away or silence anyone who threatens that comfort.\n\nwhere there is deep care and love. Sometimes we mistake “care” with “letting people stay comfortable in old patterns”. And sometimes we assume that holding space is only about providing safe space where a person feels free of judgement and free of the need to change or grow. Holding space, though, is much more complex than that.\n\nthere are times when we need to be held in safety without any pressure to change our behaviour or our choices. Especially when healing from trauma or when deep in new grief, safety is paramount and should not be compromised.\n\nALSO a feeling of safety is usually a first step in establishing enough trust so that we CAN step into bravery.\n\nIn fact some people who cling to their own safety do harm to others in the process.\n\n**Check-in about people’s readiness for more bravery.** A community that’s thrust into bravery without preparation and/or discernment about their readiness can quickly become fractured beyond repair. Start with a hard conversation, revealing what you believe to be true about an over-reliance on safety, and ask people whether they feel emotionally stable enough to try something different.\n\n**Build trust that can support bravery.**\n\nTrust-building involves keeping stories confidential, showing up when you promise to show up, being an engaged listener, withholding scorn, and being dependable.\n\nInspire some to be brave so others will follow.\n\n**Invite an outsider to serve as the mirror.**\n\nUse a talking piece.\n\n**Practice asking braver questions.** If people have indicated a readiness for brave space, then start by asking braver questions that invite new perspectives and growth.\n\nask “are you ready for a brave question?” If the person says yes, they’ll offer something that will invite the person to see their story through a new lens. A brave question might be something like “What might change if you let go of this resentment?” or “How are you trying to protect yourself from pain?” or “Do you believe you’re worthy of more happiness?” (For more brave questions, check out [50 Questions that Could Change Your Life](https://heatherplett.com/questions/).)\n\n**Take care of each other.**Stepping into bravery and vulnerability can leave us feeling tender and raw, and that’s a time when community support is even more necessary. If you are in a transition period with your community/family/partnership/etc., where you’re learning to be more brave, make sure you’re also setting aside extra time for play, self-care, group-care, and laughter.\n\n# Reference\n\nPlett, H.

Introduce yourself\n2. Identify client's problems\n3. Show approach on how to fix the problem\n4. Timeline and what you will do (should also include a quote to help your client understand why you quoted the price).\n5. Show example works and portfolio.\n6. Sign and pay me\n7.

  "/What-Does-It-All-Mean-Nagel-Book-summary": {
    "title": "What Does It All Mean? — Nagel (Book summary)",
    "content": "\nIn _What Does It All Mean?_ Thomas Nagel explores nine questions that philosophers have been trying to answer for thousands of years. Nagel believes that engaging with these questions directly is the best way to start a study of philosophy. He introduces the beginning philosopher to the questions and the most common arguments about them. Within his discussion, Nagel also inserts his own stand on the problems but cautions the reader not to rely on his conclusions. Instead, he repeatedly encourages the reader to think through the questions using her own reasoning.\n\n## Chapter One: Introduction\n\n**Chapter Summary: Philosophy is best studied by engaging with the philosophical questions first before anything else.**\n\n- Begin your study of philosophy by thinking about the questions directly. Examine some possible solutions and look for their pitfalls. Do this and you will be in a better position to read the works of others.\n- Philosophy is different from science or mathematics because it does not rely on experiments or formal methods of proof.\n- The main concern of philosophy is to question and understand the very common ideas that we take for granted.\n- Philosophy can be difficult because the more basic the ideas one is trying to investigate, the fewer the available tools. A philosopher cannot assume too much. A philosopher can't take things for granted.\n\n## Chapter Two: How Do We Know Anything?\n\n**Chapter Summary: To solve the problem of how you know anything, ponder on (1) whether there is really a physical world outside your mind or if your mind is the only thing that exists, and (2) consider whether or not it is all right to go on believing on an external world even if it does not exist.**\n\n- The inside of your own mind is the only thing you can be sure of.\n- To conclude that a physical world outside your mind because you \"sense\" it is a weak proposition. Trying to prove the reliability of your senses by appealing to your senses is circular reasoning.\n- Ponder on this: What if all your experiences are just a giant dream with no external world outside it?\n- If the \"giant dream\" exists, then any evidence you use to prove that there is a physical world outside your mind will just really be part of the \"giant dream.\"\n- All evidence about what could be an outside world should come through your mind.\n- Ponder on this: Maybe, there is no physical world outside your mind. Maybe, only you, the subject of experience, is the one that exists.\n- \"Solipsism\" is the view that your mind is the only thing that exists.\n- Solipsism is a conclusion that is more than the evidence warrants.\n- Thomas Nagel's position: \"You don't know anything beyond your impressions and experiences.\" This position is also called \"skepticism.\"\n- A stronger form of skepticism proposes that you can't be sure that you existed in the past because all you have to go on are the present contents of your mind.\n- Argument: \"There is a physical world outside your mind because your internal experiences have external causes.\" Skeptic's answer: \"Even if external causes exist, they cannot be observed directly. They have to go through the mind. How can you be sure about their properties and existence?\"\n- Science doesn't hold the final answer to whether or not there is a physical world outside your mind. Science relies on observation through the senses. If we can't establish the reliability of our senses, we can't establish the reliability of science.\n- Verificationism is the belief that without the possibility of a correct view of how things are, the thought that one's impressions are not true is meaningless.\n- According to verificationism, if a physical world outside your mind does not exist, then what seems to be an illusion is actually perceptions of reality. Verificationism requires that reality is what we can observe.\n- \"Egocentric predicament\" is the problem of not being able to see reality as it is because of being trapped inside one's mind.\n- It is difficult to escape our acceptance of the existence of a physical world outside our minds.\n\n## Chapter Three: Other Minds\n\n**Chapter Summary: To solve the problem of whether or not other minds exist, (1) explore what you can really know beyond the contents of your mind, and (2) consider the possibility that there might be much less or much more conscious life than you assume.**\n\n- The only experience you can actually have is your own.\n- Your belief that other people have their own experiences is based on your observation of their behavior. You can't enter their minds and experience it yourself.\n- It is uncertain whether two human beings could have the same exact experience.\n- Physical differences and other factors may contribute to differences in experience.\n- The differences in sensual experiences among human beings may or may not be radical. We can't know 100%.\n- The experiences of human beings could be entirely different among each other.\n- Radical conclusion: Because you can't experience other people's mental lives directly, it is plausible to conclude that other minds do not exist.\n- If other minds do not exist, their physical behavior is caused by physical factors.\n- You can't be sure 100% that other minds exist just because other people act and talk. You don't see the connection between other people's inner experience and their behavior \"directly.\"\n- To \"immediately\" believe that other minds exist just because it \"seems\" obvious is to rely on instinct, not knowledge.\n- If you accept that there are other people who have minds, you should be ready to accept that animals, plants, cells, nonliving things, and even machines \"could\" have minds too.\n- The only way you can be sure that other people, other organisms, and other things have minds is to observe \"directly\" the correlations between their internal experience and their physical manifestations. Since we don't have any capability to observe these correlations \"directly,\" we can't be 100% sure about the presence or the absence of other minds.\n\n## Chapter Four: The Mind-Body Problem\n\n**Chapter Summary: There seem to be two states happening within a person: mental states and physical states. How these states interact and whether or not they are mutually exclusive is a problem that has bothered philosophers for thousands of years.**\n\n- What happens to the mind seems to depend on what happens to the body.\n- Ponder this: Is your mind something different from your brain, though connected to it? Or is it part of your brain?\n- The mind is different from the brain because brain processes can be observed by an outsider but the mind (feelings, sensations, experiences) cannot be observed by the same outsider.\n- If the contents of the mind cannot be observed by an outsider in a way that she can observe the contents of the brain, then the mind cannot be a \"physical\" part or state of the brain.\n- \"Dualism\" is the view that a person is made up of two substances: matter and mind. Another way to put this is that a person has a body and a soul.\n- \"Physicalism\" also known as \"materialism\" is the view that a person consists of noting but physical matter. Therefore, the mind and its contents are simply physical states of the brain. There is only the body, there is no soul.\n- \"Dual aspect theory\" is an alternative to both dualism and physicalism. It is the view that a brain is an object with both physical and mental properties.\n- Mental states can't simply be explained by purely physical causes and effects. Mental states \"feel\" a certain way that is different from a physical phenomenon.\n- Thomas Nagel's position: There is a physical reality that people can observe from the outside. There is a mental reality that individuals experience from the inside. This mental reality could also occur to other organisms.\n- To have a purely physical theory about the mind and the body, and therefore the entire universe, the mind or consciousness has to be identified with some physical state.\n- So far, it is impossible to have a unified physical theory of the universe because arguments against it are strong enough to refute it.\n\n## Chapter Five: The Meaning of Words\n\n**Chapter Summary: Words allow us to understand the universe, communicate with each other, and invent things. But it is a mystery how words have this incredible power.**\n\n- There is no resemblance between a word and its referent. The relationship of a word to its referent is indirect.\n- But you cannot understand a word by itself. In order to understand a word, you need to see or know its referent.\n- We use other words to give a word meaning, a definition. But this could be circular reasoning. We need to get to some words that have \"direct meanings.\"\n- What is unusual with a word is that when you use it both in written or oral form, it refers to all the samples of its referent in the past, present, and the future. It refers to all its possible uses, both true and false.\n- Behind a word is a concept, a mental picture of what the word represents. This raises new problems because the word refers to both \"the object\" and \"the concept of that object.\"\n- The problem with a word's meaning is that it is not located anywhere, not in the word, in the mind, or in the concept.\n- The social phenomenon of language does not fully explain the universal meaning of words.\n\n## Chapter Six: Free Will\n\n**Chapter Summary: To solve the problem of whether or not free will exists, (1) explain what you mean when you say you could have done something other than what you did, and (2) explain what you and the world would have to be like for this to be true.**\n\n- Determinism is the view that existing laws of nature create series of circumstances that make the actions that people take inevitable, ruling out other possibilities.\n- If determinism is true, it implies that people should not be held responsible for their actions, because they did not choose them.\n- Some people argue that even if determinism is true, it is still practical to praise people for doing good and to punish them for doing bad.\n- Some scientists argue that because there's more than one thing an electron may do at any given moment, determinism is false.\n- If determinism is incorrect, then free will definitely exist, and people should be held responsible for their actions.\n- For free will to exist: (1) an actor determined her action by doing it, (2) her action was not determined in advance, (3) her action did not just happen, and (4) she could have done the opposite.\n- Ponder this: You are made up of your desires, beliefs, personality, and the circumstances that created who you are. If an action that you performed is absent of all these forces, could we conclude that \"you\" really did it?\n- If free will is true and choices are not determined by forces and circumstances within your life, then you could not have done what you did. You could not be held responsible for your actions.\n- If free will exists, then it is plausible that things just happen with no reason.\n- Whether or not determinism is true, it is still plausible that we are not responsible for our actions. If determinism is true, antecedent circumstances are responsible. If determinism is false, nothing is responsible.\n- To claim that the existence of free will implies that things just happen with no reason is meaningless. Free will is just a basic feature of the world and cannot be analyzed.\n- Thomas Nagel's position: If everything that people did was determined then they are essentially trapped. They could not be held responsible for their actions.\n\n## Chapter Seven: Right and Wrong\n\n**Chapter Summary: The biggest problem in ethics and morality is whether or not there is a universal standard for them. Given that humans act according to their motives and that motives are innumerable, a single standard for ethical behavior seems farfetched.**\n\n- Not all \"lawful\" acts are necessarily \"right\" acts.\n- Thoughts about the wrongness of certain behaviors are based on a concern to the effect of one's actions on people in general.\n- Ponder this: If you can get what you want by doing something considered to be wrong, why shouldn't you?\n- Most religious motivations to ethical behavior identify something that a person should care about (God), and then connect morality to it.\n- An objection to using God as the ultimate motivation to refrain from doing bad is that even if God exists and forbids what is wrong, his forbidding isn't what makes the act wrong. The act is wrong and that is why God forbids it.\n- There is no substitute for a direct concern for other people as the basis of moral behavior.\n- The problem with morality is that it is supposed to apply to everyone, and yet not everyone has a concern for other people and those who care about other people only care about those they know, not everyone.\n- The universality of morality is questioned when we compare the motives of different individuals and societies at different times.\n- The most radical form of moral relativism claims that the most basic standards of right and wrong depend entirely on the social and cultural conventions.\n- Thomas Nagel's position: Relativism is problematic because it always seems possible to criticize the accepted standards of any society. However, to criticize a society's moral code means to appeal to a more objective standard, which itself is unclear.\n- The most foundational question about morality is how universal and objective it is.\n- The problem with moral arguments is that they appeal to a capacity for impartial motivation which is supposed to be present in all of us but seems deeply buried.\n- It is difficult to justify morality because people have so many motives behind their actions.\n\n## Chapter Eight: Justice\n\n**Chapter Summary: To tackle the problem of inequality and justice, (1) identify which causes of inequalities are morally wrong, and (2) determine which methods of interfering with these inequalities are morally right.**\n\n- There are two kinds of inequalities: one that is deliberately imposed and one that is accidental.\n- Deliberately imposed inequality—like racial and gender discrimination—is self-evidently wrong because the discriminator is doing something wrong. The remedy is simply to prevent it.\n- To analyze whether or not inequalities caused by luck are really wrong is a more difficult philosophical question.\n- Ponder this: \"Are those people who were born in rich families by luck really at fault to inequalities in a competitive social system? Is it wrong for people to accumulate wealth to better the lives of their families? Is it right to take money away from rich people to give to those who were born in poor families also by luck?\"\n- Two main sources of accidental inequalities in a competitive social system are: (1) differences in socioeconomic classes into which people are born, and (2) differences in natural abilities and talents.\n- To remedy accidental inequalities caused by differences in socioeconomic classes, either: (1) interfere with the causes or (2) interfere with inequalities directly.\n- Interfering with the causes of accidental inequalities is problematic because these are relatively innocent choices arising from a motive to improve one's state in life.\n- It is easier to interfere with the inequalities directly but doing so does not remove the inequalities permanently. This is usually done by taking money from the rich through various forms of taxation and giving that money to the poor in the form of welfare programs.\n- There is not much we can do to eradicate inequalities based on talent if we do not abolish the competitive social system itself. While this could solve the inequalities, it will incur heavy costs on freedom and efficiency.\n- People who are against redistributive taxation argue that economic transactions that produce inequalities are not inherently wrong and that it isn't right for governments to interfere on people who aren't deliberately hurting anyone.\n- Thomas Nagel's position: Both deliberately imposed and accidental inequalities are unfair. We need redistributive taxation and social welfare programs.\n- The problem of \"global inequality and justice\" is problematic just because there is no world government to regulate transactions among nations and such a government would probably be a bad government.\n\n## Chapter Nine: Death\n\n**Chapter Summary: Two important philosophical questions concerning death are: (1) \"What happens when we die?\" and (2) \"Is dying a bad thing or a good thing?\"**\n\n- The question of survival after death is related to the mind-body problem.\n- For dualists, the soul could exist on its own even without the body so it continues its mental life after death.\n- People who reject the dualist view on death argue that the soul seems to depend entirely on the body for its continued existence.\n- For physicalists, life after death is impossible because physical death means mental death.\n- Thomas Nagel's position: Ordinary observation should be enough to convince us that there is no life after death. Consciousness is intricately dependent on our nervous system.\n- Ponder this: \"Is your death a good thing or a bad thing? We accept that there was a time before we were born when we didn't yet exist, so why are we bothered about the prospect of not existing again at death?\"\n- There are three plausible answers to the question above: (1) Death is neutral because nonexistence can't be good or bad; (2) Death is bad because nonexistence is the ultimate evil; and (3) Death is good because it is boring to live forever.\n- Logically, we should only fear death if we will survive it.\n\n## Chapter Ten: The Meaning of Life\n\n**Chapter Summary: For one's life to have meaning, it has to be part of something bigger than itself. But to follow this line of reasoning could lead to the conclusion that life is pointless after all.**\n\n- We can't live forever so we can only find the meaning of life within life itself.\n- Ponder this: \"There are justifications for the little things that we do. But is there really a point in our life as a whole?\"\n- For our life to have meaning, it has to be part of something larger.\n- But we can ask the question again: \"What is the meaning of that 'larger thing?'\"\n- Some people point to this 'larger thing' as God or another \"ultimate explanation.\" But this does not satisfy the questions.\n- Questions about the meaning of the \"ultimate explanation\" can continue ad infinitum. This leads to a painful logical conclusion: that life has no meaning after all.\n- Even if life is inherently meaningless, it is still useful to accept the belief that what one does matters.\n",

  "/What-I-Learned-From-A-Year-of-Reading-Thoreaus-Journal": {
    "title": "What I Learned From A Year of Reading Thoreau's Journal",
    "content": "\n![Thoreau's journal](thoreau-journal.jpg)\n\nThis day, last year, I started reading Thoreau's journal. I did this after reading Laura Dassow Wall's brilliant biography of the man. I followed the suggestion of those who have read Thoreau's journal—read each entry for the day.\n\nSome days, Thoreau had lots of entries and it took me about an hour to read all of them. Other days, he wrote none. I later found out that the copy I was reading was a shortened version of Thoreau's [14-volume journal](https://www.walden.org/collection/journals/). So, I can't really claim that I have read everything he wrote in his most private and most important work unless I go back to the original volumes. Nevertheless, I have read enough to understand Thoreau better.\n\nI believe that every writer or artist needs a muse—even better, a set of muses, a pantheon of heroes, to look up to. Thoreau is, obviously, already part of my pantheon. But this only happened after I got to really know him as a person through his journal. I think this is the best way to create a bond with our heroes—if their journal is accessible, read it, even before reading their books. A journal is usually more honest than anything a writer can produce. This was true especially with Thoreau, who intentionally treated his journal as his most important work.\n\n## Translating Thoreau\n\nSince reading his biography and journal, I have also [drawn the man](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCZ2tyeBfon/), watched a [documentary of his life](http://www.filmsbyhuey.com/films/henry-david-thoreau-surveyor-of-the-soul/), and presented a talk about his life and creative process to a few friends. What really cemented my relationship with him, however, was my daily practice of [translating my favorite quotes](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vithoreau/) from his journal into Filipino.\n\nI chose quotes that had a universal appeal—quotes that, when translated into Filipino, spoke about things that Filipinos can relate to, things like employment, art, nature, solitude, power, and self-discovery. I then coupled those quotes with photos I have taken during my own walks and bike rides.\n\n## Deeper Immersion In Nature\n\nI have been walking and biking even before I read Thoreau, but my exploration of the outdoors became more meaningful and interesting because of him. For example, about a month ago, I tried mimicking what Thoreau did in his walks—I wrote down everything I saw. In the past, I would just walk and wait for inspiration to come. Sometimes, I would be able to write a poem or visualize a fantasy scene or realize a philosophical breakthrough while walking. I wasn't really immersed in my surroundings.\n\nAfter reading Thoreau, I became more intentional in noticing my surroundings. I started learning how to [read the weather through clouds](https://nature-mentor.com/how-to-predict-weather-with-clouds/), noting how the sky looked in the North, South, East, and West. I also started tracking the flora I see in my walks, taking pictures of even the most ignored weed and uploading them to an app called [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/), which identifies the plant for me. This was what Thoreau did in his walks. Aside from my brief fascination with the different indigenous trees growing on a [permaculture farm](https://mmsheal.wordpress.com/) I volunteered to, I have never been interested in botany. Today, it is a field of interest that I continue to explore when I find time.\n\nI also started being more interested with birds. I could now identify some of the most common birds in my locale: the Eurasian sparrow, the Yellow-vented Bulbul, the Pied Fantail (Maria Cafra), the Zebra Dove (Bato Bato), the Blue Heron, the Olive-backed Sunbird, the Brown Shrike, the Pacific Swallow, and the Bush Hen (Sikling). I have even spotted a kingfisher in a pond near my place, which reminds me a lot of Thoreau's Walden.\n\n![Lobong CIS](lobong-CIS.jpg \"The Lobong CIS, my very own Walden.\")\n\n## The Highest of Arts\n\nHowever, Thoreau's greatest gift to me was his example as a human being whose primary desire was to be amazed about the beauty that surrounded him. Through Thoreau, I learned how to live better, not just as a writer or an artist, but primarily a human being who is part of a larger cosmic ecosystem.\n\nThe biggest lesson I learned from a year of reading Thoreau's journal is encapsulated in a quote from Walden:\n\n\u003e We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical aids, but by an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not forsake us even in our soundest sleep. I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavour. It is something to be able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do. To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts.\n",

    "content": "\n10 Highlights from What Is Self-Directed Education? | Alliance for Self-Directed Education\n\n---\n\nWhat Is Self-Directed Education? Education that derives from the self-chosen activities and life experiences of the person being educated.\n\n---\n\nEducation is the sum of everything a person learns that enables that person to live a satisfying and meaningful life.\n\n---\n\nThis includes the kinds of things that people everywhere more or less need to learn, such as how to walk upright, how to speak their native language, how to get along with others, how to regulate their emotions, how to make plans and follow through on them, and how to think critically and make good decisions.\n\n---\n\nIt also includes some culture-specific skills, such as, in our culture, how to read, how to calculate with numbers, how to use computers, maybe how to drive a car—the things that most people feel they need to know in order to live the kind of life they want to live in the culture in which they are growing up.\n\n---\n\nBut much of education, for any individual, entails sets of skills and knowledge that may differ sharply from person to person, even within a given culture. As each person’s concept of “a satisfying and meaningful life” is unique, each person’s education is unique. Society benefits from such diversity.\n\n---\n\nself-directed education is education that derives from the self-chosen activities and life experiences of the person becoming educated, whether or not those activities were chosen deliberately for the purpose of education.\n\n---\n\nSelf-directed education can include organized classes or lessons, if freely chosen by the learner\n\n---\n\nMost self-directed education comes from everyday life, as people pursue their own interests and learn along the way. The motivating forces include curiosity, playfulness, and sociability—which promote all sorts of endeavors from which people learn. Self-directed education necessarily leads different individuals along different paths, though the paths may often overlap, as each person’s interests and goals in life are in some ways unique and in some ways shared by others.\n\n---\n\nSelf-directed education can be contrasted to imposed schooling, which is forced upon individuals, regardless of their desire for it, and is motivated by systems of rewards and punishments, as occurs in conventional schools. Imposed schooling is generally aimed at enhancing conformity rather than uniqueness, and it operates by suppressing, rather than nurturing, the natural drives of curiosity, playfulness, and sociability.\n\n---\n\nSelf-Directed Education (capitalized) refers to the educational route of school-aged children whose families have chosen not to enroll them in imposed schooling, but, instead, allow the children to take charge of all of their education. More specifically, these are families that have enrolled their children in schools that support young people’s pursuits of their own interests and do not impose a curriculum or who homeschool their children by the method commonly called unschooling, where the children pursue their own interests rather than an imposed curriculum. This final distinction is between “SDE” as an alternative to conventional schooling, and “sde” that may happen outside of school, even for people in conventional schooling.\n\n## References\n\n2020-11-10T01:59:38.000Z  · This note was created with LINER By Vince Imbat\n\nHighlighted Source : [https://share.getliner.com/tVWNV](https://share.getliner.com/tVWNV)\n\nOriginal Source : [https://www.self-directed.org/sde/](https://www.self-directed.org/sde/)\n\n",

    "content": "\n* Highlight, page 188\ncriteria for the concept of lyric philosophy are never stipulated in that book, and refraining from such stipulation is connected with the very nature of the investigation\n\n* Highlight, page 188\n“Lyric meaning,” writes Zwicky, “is proto-linguistic. It underlies and informs linguistic meaning but is, at the same time, broader in scope. Its root is\n\n* Highlight, page 189\ngestural.”\n\n* Highlight, page 189\n“Form and content are inextricably bound up with one another—how you say is what you mean”\n\n* Highlight, page 189\nthe experience of finding some music deeply meaningful and yet failing to fit any words to it. such an experience might be shelved as a mere curiosity if music’s resistance to linguistic articulation were trivial or unique. But it isn’t: a few moments of reflection suggest that it shares this feature with many other phenomena. consider loving someone; being in the presence of beauty; bearing witness to atrocity. or pausing on a gravel road at twilight, caught in the gaze of a deer. sitting down at the kitchen table, after a death, and trying to write an adequate letter of sympathy. Trying accurately to describe something relatively commonplace, but specific, like the sound of a clarinet, or the aroma of coffee. Why can’t it be done?\n\n* Highlight, page 189\nsome things, she suggests, “can be more clearly shown than said”\n\n* Highlight, page 189\n“It doesn’t mean the same way as language does. Music’s meaning is a function of resonance and resonance involves a kind of integrity.”\n\n* Highlight, page 189\nZwicky’s work is one of the most original and elucidatory defenses of that practice; but it is, also, an exemplary contribution to it. she is responsible for, among other things, having offered the practice an apt name, and having performed the service of perspicuously collecting more than a few members of its family.\n\n* Highlight, page 189\nthe practice itself is at least as old as Herakleitos\n\n* Highlight, page 190\nand Lˇao Zi.\n\n* Highlight, page 190\nit is a mistake to fixate on written work, instead of turning to that toward which the work is gesturing.\n\n* Highlight, page 190\nEach two-page spread is composed as a structural unit, which has been called a “duon.” on the left hand, one finds text authored by Zwicky (which is not itself monologic, since it moves around and splits, questions itself, impersonates a variety of interlocutors with different tones of voice, some impatient, others sympathetic, for example); on the right hand, one finds excerpts from texts by analytic, continental, and lyric philosophers, musical scores, paintings, photographs, et cetera.\n\n* Highlight, page 190\n“The right-hand text is a scrapbook; a way of paying intellectual debts; a series of suggestions for further reading; a chorus of agents provocateurs; the vocal score for a conceptual opera; a homage.... The relation of the two texts to one another is somewhere between counterpoint and harmony, somewhere between a double helix and the allemande of the earth and moon”\n\n* Highlight, page 190\nto see that a work of philosophy can proceed both contrapuntally (left/right on each duon) and sequentially (page one to the end)—that appears to be something new.\n\n* Highlight, page 190\nwithin the counterpoint of any given duon, in the left or right entry, there may be an intra-textual dialogue: the left-hand text may be questioning itself, or members of the right-hand chorus may be harmonizing or disagreeing with one another. Equally importantly, some of the echoes between disparately placed entries move along an axis at an angle different from either the contrapuntal or the sequential axes.\n\n* Highlight, page 191\nPhilosophy is thinking in love with clarity.\n\n* Highlight, page 191\nZwicky repeatedly cautions that she is not attempting to supplant analysis with lyric\n\n* Highlight, page 191\nher work might be read as reminding philosophy of the range of its indigenous resources.\n\n* Highlight, page 191\nThe accuracy of the definition can be tested by its ability to save the phenomena, to save what we already recognize as philosophy while also inviting us to extend recognition to cases that have been neglected or marginalized. and we might notice something else about the definition: it is sonorously composed\n\n* Highlight, page 192\nThis pair of texts—Zwicky’s aphoristic definition of philosophy on the left-hand page and Bringhurst’s poem on the right-hand page—also shows us one of the forms that clarity can assume: resonance\n\n* Highlight, page 192\na contrasting form of clarity, the one with which many twenty-first-century anglophone philosophers are more comfortable, is, of course, analysis.\n\n* Highlight, page 192\n“a methodology that, for the most part, appears ... to proceed on the assumption that understanding is a function of breaking a whole into its component parts, plus the view that such a breaking, in the case of ideas, is not attended by any loss of meaning”\n\n* Highlight, page 192\n“an insistence on the generic superiority of the rational intellect to emotions, desires, and ‘the body’”\n\n* Highlight, page 192\nWe may call the first feature (1) “analytic method,” and the second feature (2) “hierarchical dualism.” Both receive a definitive modern formulation in the work of descartes.\n\n* Highlight, page 192\nThese different forms of clarity are responsive to different sorts of structures.\n\n* Highlight, page 193\nLogico-analytic arguments should work in this way, too: we should be able to abstract from any stylistic particulars and paraphrase the thing purely, for example in unornamented prose, or in symbols. and such representations can be very useful for achieving a clarifying overview of some argumentative structures.\n\n* Highlight, page 193\nWhatever the thought, it is more clearly embodied in, enacted by, Bringhurst’s gesture. We might say that his poem has integrity.\n\n* Highlight, page 193\n“Resonance is a function of the integration of various components in a whole” (L34). When they stand in an appropriate relationship—when they are integrated, or attuned—distinct components can transit vibrations to each other. and to permit of integration, the whole itself needs to be complex or “polydimensional” (L5). Here it is worth remembering, as one model of polydimensionality, the many different axes of motion exemplified by Zwicky’s book: contrapuntal and sequential and dialogic and echoic, et cetera. (For the sake of contrast, we might ask: is “integration” imaginable for a unidimensional object? Would it make sense to claim that the conclusion of a valid argument “resonates” with its premises?)\n\n* Highlight, page 195\nthe roots of these metaphors are not esoteric; they are physical.\n\n* Highlight, page 195\nstringed instruments are “good physical analogues” of some kinds of “lyric structures.”\n\n* Highlight, page 195\nWhen the complex structure is in tune—integrated—it is capable of resonance.\n\n* Highlight, page 195\none could say that a chord is its component tones; and there\n\n* Highlight, page 196\nis no hierarchy of importance among these tones: each makes an indispensable contribution, in collaboration with its brothers and sisters, to the identity of this chord. (compare, while also noting the differences among, a chord, an organism, a family, an ecological community.)\n\n* Highlight, page 196\nWe speak of understanding something in the sense in which it can be replaced by another which means the same; but also in the sense in which it cannot be replaced by any other.\n\n* Highlight, page 196\nsome thinking—lyric thinking—is more chord-like than device-like, and that different forms of clarity are appropriate in response to different contexts. some things—whose way of meaning is like the way that music means—can be more clearly shown through resonant gestures than through those that foreclose on resonance.\n\n* Highlight, page 196\nIt is in this way, then, that philosophy might assume lyric form: when thought whose eros is clarity is driven also by profound intuitions of coherence—when it is also an attempt to arrive at an integrated perception, a picture or understanding of how something might affect us as beings with bodies and emotions as well as the ability to think logically....\n\n* Highlight, page 196\nWhen philosophy attempts to give voice to an ecology of experience. (LP, L68)\n\n* Highlight, page 196\necological structures are lyric structures\n\n* Highlight, page 196\n“The\n\n* Highlight, page 197\ncoherence that lyric awareness intuits, and that lyric thought attempts to render, is ecological in form”\n\n* Highlight, page 197\ncan lyric thinking be beautiful? does it, like beauty, offer some relief from time? How can it, when it seems sensitive to, inflected by, the mortality of things? and what about geometrical thinking, which emerges as a contrasting case in its alleged freedom from time: can’t it be beautiful, too? We find that none of lyric, geometry, and beauty are identical with one another; but it seems that there are lyric and geometrical species of beauty.\n\n* Highlight, page 198\nIn the Western analytic tradition, knowledge has standardly been defined as (some version of) justified true belief.\n\n* Highlight, page 200\nit is crucial to stress that the method is not expository, but enactive. The thought is not merely asserted and then explained; instead, it is shown, and the reader is enabled to experience it, through the rhythms of the writing.\n\n# References",

    "content": "\n![Reading silhouette](Reading-silhouette.jpg)\n\nWhen I finished my college degree in 2014, I noticed something: I started reading a lot. I don't have a good explanation to this other than, perhaps, having more freedom of time and freedom to choose what subjects to explore. This two really got me into reading, like a caged animal let loose for the first time. Not that I wasn't really a reader. I read a lot when I was a child. But 17 years of schooling does something that most of us don't notice: it sucks the life out of our intellectual freedom.\n\nSo last night and this morning, I began going down memory lane and listing all the books I finished reading since 2015 and prepared [[library|this page to you]].\n\nIt is not a complete list. It does not include all the books I may have started but never finished. It does not include books I haven't logged in the Book Summaries stack in my Evernote. But it's a robust list.\n\n![Evernote Book Summaries Stack](Evernote-Book-Summaries-Stack.png)\n\nAfter reading a book, I create a notebook in my Evernote and write a chapter-by-chapter summary of the book. This practice forces me to review what I just finished reading and take note of the main points. I share some of these summaries in the blog. Turns out, this is also a great way to keep an archive of all my reading.\n\nCreating a list like this is like creating a personal intellectual history. It reminded me of the books I used to really love but no longer and of ideas I once thought were so good but no longer. It's a reminder of all the hard work I've done in reclaiming my intellectual autonomy.\n\nIf you want to create a similar list, check out [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/reading/) and [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/tag/my-reading-year/) for more inspiration.\n\nAnd in case you missed it, here's [[library|my list again]].",

The mind rests and the body follows.\n\nI took this photo after deciding to cut short what could have been a long bike walk. A strong storm was on the watch for a few days now and we've been expecting heavy rain. But we had fair weather most of the day and the trails have dried up so I decided to hop on my bike and give it a try.\n\nI only had about half an hour of good late afternoon sun when the sky started to go gray and tiny drops of rain began to fall. And since it was a long way home, I knew I had to turn back.\n\nAnd that particular moment, that turning back, was when I saw this beautiful rainbow, full in its grandeur, only cut by a cotton ball of clouds at the middle.\n\nI was stunned. I just have to take a photo of it.\n\nReflecting on this photo now, I am reminded that while I am more inclined to believe on coincidences than synchronicity, I do think that it is logical that intentionality and purposeful living bring one closer to moments like these - moments when rest and relief come easier, and sometimes in surprising ways.\n\nNo matter how large your storm is, when your rainbow comes, you remember that you can be waterproof, sometimes.\n",

    "title": "Which is more fundamental, amoralism or anarchy?",
    "content": "\nWhat comes first? What is more fundamental: anarchy or amoralism? At first glance, it seems to be amoralism, because it is a metaphysical claim. However, what we know or believe to know about the world is not directly the motivator to action. [[Action is driven by a preference or value]] (i.e., action is purposeful). It has to have a goal or intention. [[thoughts/purpose]] is only possible if we [[Value]] something or, to be more accurate, if we prefer something. This preference is not objective and absolute. It is subjective. Since living and all it subcategories like relating to others (i.e., [[Politics]]) is all about actions, living, therefore, necessitates preference.\n\nWe might be able to see things objectively through mindfulness, but acting is always subjective, reflective of our \"values,\" our preferences. [[Anarchy]], a theory on how we should treat each other, is subjective, value-driven, and therefore is the same as [[Liberal democracy]] and [[Socialism]] in that it needs to propagate itself. One might be correct with one's [[Amoralism]], but people are not persuaded to believe on something just because it is true. People believe in something because it is relevant and valuable to them. Therefore in organizing society, the central question is individual freedom: Will we let other people live their lives the way they want to or do we use force for them to do things the way we want? There is no right and wrong absolute objective answer. The reality is simply that the one who holds power dictates the regime. It's not wrong or right, it's just how things are.\n\nIn anarchy, one way of resolving differences is the mutual agreement on private property. We may have different beliefs and values and therefore rules of acting and living. But if you are in my personal property, this is how we do it. You have to follow. I will do the same if I go to your personal property. If we don't want such things to happen thenn we have to live separately in our personal properties. The coexistence happens between property owners who respect each other's laws.\n\n[[Can consciousness be objective?]]\n\n[[How to apply anarchy in a marriage?]]\n\n# References\n",

Here it is less clear. It is difficult to be intentional with the images I capture while separating fact from meaning. All my photographs moving forward that I want to share shall have meaning. Shall be meaningful. Or perhaps I should just let myself free and try to flow. But at the same time always strengthen my philosophical tendencies so that it tranports into how I see things.\n\nPhilosophy -\u003e Walking -\u003e Photos + Narratives\n\nIt is always philosophy first. The thinking. The meaning-making.\n\n- Leaving: leaving the church (on a bike, protesting by not attending the memorial)\n- Reconnecting with the past: years later, I walked in Baguio remembering the many walks I did there as a preacher. And realizing I can still do this. Can still walk and remember what I did before.\n- Searching: 10 years since I left the church and I still feel like I am looking for something: community, purpose, belief. That search has felt a lot like it isn't moving. Establishing new friendships is hard. Trying out new ideas is hard. There is a feeling of always starting out from zero. When I walk, I always feel like I am moving. I am still searching but I am not doing it too hard and it always feels like I am making progress.\n- Insight and rigorous intellectual exercise: I think deep when walking.\n- Surprise\n- Cultural, historical, and societal familiarization\n- Being good\n- Being healthy\n- Mindfulness\n\n# Other reasons\n\nBeing in nature not only makes me feel better but also reminds me of what man is when bare of all the things he is now—of what is truly important.

    "content": "\nThrough much of human history, frugal simplicity was not a choice but a necessity – and since necessary, it was also deemed a moral virtue. But with the advent of industrial capitalism and a consumer society, a system arose that was committed to relentless growth, and with it grew a population (aka ‘the market’) that was enabled and encouraged to buy lots of stuff that, by traditional standards, was surplus to requirements. As a result, there’s a disconnect between the traditional values we have inherited and the consumerist imperatives instilled in us by contemporary culture.\n\nLiving simply now strikes many people as simply boring.\n\nYet there seems to be growing interest, especially among millennials, in rediscovering the benefits of simple living. Some of this might reflect a kind of nostalgia for the pre-industrial or pre-consumerist world, and also sympathy for the moral argument that says that living in a simple manner makes you a better person, by building desirable traits such as frugality, resilience and independence – or a happier person, by promoting peace of mind and good health, and keeping you close to nature.\n\nOur _thinking_ about simplicity and luxury, frugality and extravagance, is fundamentally inconsistent. We condemn extravagance that is wasteful or tasteless and yet we tout monuments of past extravagance, such as the Forbidden City in Beijing or the palace at Versailles, as highly admirable. The truth is that much of what we call ‘culture’ is fuelled by forms of extravagance.\n\nSomewhat paradoxically, then, the case for living simply was most persuasive when most people had little choice but to live that way. The traditional arguments for simple living in effect rationalise a necessity. But the same arguments have less purchase when the life of frugal simplicity is a choice, one way of living among many. Then the philosophy of frugality becomes a hard sell.\n\nThat might be about to change, under the influence of two factors: economics and environmentalism. When recession strikes, as it has done recently (revealing inherent instabilities in an economic system committed to unending growth) millions of people suddenly find themselves in circumstances where frugality once again becomes a necessity, and the value of its associated virtues is rediscovered.\n\nThese growing inequalities invite a fresh critique of extravagance and waste.\n\nThe philosophy of frugal simplicity expresses values and advocates a lifestyle that might be our best hope for reversing these trends and preserving our planet’s fragile ecosystems.\n\nBut if our current methods of making, getting, spending and discarding prove unsustainable, then there could come a time – and it might come quite soon – when we are forced towards simplicity. In which case, a venerable tradition will turn out to contain the philosophy of the future.\n\n## References",

Also, he made it a point to balance reading and writing with walking.\n\nNietszche has ideas on the same topic:\n\n\u003e We do not belong to those who have ideas only among books, when stimulated by books. It is our habit to think outdoors – walking, leaping, climbing, dancing, preferably on lonely mountains or near the sea where even the trails become thoughtful. Our first questions about the value of a book, of a human being, or a musical composition are: Can they walk? Even more, can they dance?\n\n\u003e How quickly we guess how someone has come by his ideas; whether it was while sitting in front of his inkwell, with a pinched belly, his head bowed low over the paper – in which case we are quickly finished with his book, too! Cramped intestines betray themselves – you can bet on that – no less than closet air, closet ceilings, closet narrowness.\n\nBooks written indoors\n\n- Written solely by reading other books.\n- Overloaded with quotations, references, footnotes, explanations, refutations.\n- Difficult to internalize\n- Crammed with citations, annotations\n- Boring\n- Read slowly and with difficulty\n- Written by comparing lines\n- Written by repeating what others have said\n- Commentary of a hundred books on a single sentence from another book\n\nBooks written outdoors\n\n- Not overloaded with vain erudition.\n- Free from the bonds of other books and the thought of others.\n- Contains no explanation from anyone\n- Simply expresses one’s thought, judgement, and decision.\n- “Thought born out of movement”\n- Thought about the thing itself—without the barriers of culture and tradition.\n- Light but profound thoughts—no exegesis.\n- Light thoughts rise from conviction, opinion, and established thought.\n   - Gros has a point. I think what he is comparing here mainly is writing that requires references (well, you can’t write these kinds of books when you are inside a room, for sure). When you are walking, what you usually capture are your own thoughts—still thinking about others sometimes, but less attached to them, less depedent.\n- The simple strategy:\n   - Think while walking, walk while thinking, and let writing be but the light pause, as the body on a walk rests in contemplation of wide open spaces.\n\nTo do\n\n- I remember here that Steve Patterson also detests using references and citations. This according to him (if my memory is correct), a midieval way of scholarship. I need to relate this to what he said. If this is how we should write and think, then this is what I need to do.\n\nTags: [[Fruitful]]\n\n# References\n\nGros, F. (2014). *A Philosophy of Walking*. Verso.\n\n\u003e Thoreau, Emerson recalls, had made it a principle to give no more time to writing than he had to walking. To avoid the pitfalls of culture and libraries; for otherwise, what one writes is filled with the writing of others.\n\n\u003e Writing ought to be this: testimony to a wordless, living experience. Not the commentary on another book, not the exegesis of another text.\n\n\u003e Thus does the book, born out of experience, refer to that experience. Books are not to teach us how to live (that is the sad task of lesson-givers), but to make us want to live, to live *differently*: to find in ourselves the possibility of life, its principle.\n\n",

    "content": "\n[[The purpose of thinking is to produce insight]]. And [[Insight cannot be predetermined]]. They usually arrive as vague ideas become clearer. The path from vague ideas to insight is non-linear ([[Writing is a non-linear process]]). Only a flexible system unbounded by planning is the natural container to capture insights ([[Flexibility requires an equally flexible work structure]]). This is because [[Planning is unsuitable for thinking]].\n\nA flexible writing system should allow you to [[Use curiosity to guide your thinking]] and shift your attention to follow leads without destroying the bigger structure and trajectory of a project. This is the only way to be open to insights. And again, this is related to the subject of autonomy because [[A good workflow optimizes freedom]].\n\nRelated\n- The system should also encourage the immediate capture and nurturing of insight. Insight sometimes comes after repeated practice or returning to the same problem repeatedly. I discovered from doing [[My annual review routine]] that I have refined my answer to a question or problem in between several months, something I won't see if I don't make an annual review. Therefore, the [[thoughts/life management system]], specifically [[thoughts/forest garden of the mind]] should encourage easy capture and continuous review to help me think and feel better and, therefore, live better.\n\n# References\n\nAhrens, S.

    "content": "\nIt has been quite some time since I last published here in the blog. But I’m going back to publishing more in the following days after someone, a really special person, close to my heart said: “you are at your best when you write.\"\n\nShe’s right. Actually, I have not been myself in the past weeks since I stopped writing and publishing regularly. It’s like an inherent part of me - self-expression - was neglected and is asking so bad to be rejuvenated. True, writing and blogging has made me more intentional since I began and it has brought so many beautiful memories since I began.\n\nWriting has always been the love of my life. My love affair with writing actually started with my love affair with books. Later on, I noticed that the two actually intertwined, as I grew more in love with reading books, I developed an unquenchable desire to create them myself. I’ve never published a physical book just yet but my writing grew better and better, and right now, more genuine and more intimate.\n\nThat was what become of my writing recently. Since I joined Dave Ursillo’s Literati Writers and took his free program “8 Tenets of Healthier Writing,” I felt my relationship with the written word changed - it became truer, more genuine, real, and intimate, like a best friend I never had. I decided to have a hiatus with publishing and instead wrote more for myself sharing some with a small group of passionate, kind, and uncritical people inside Dave’s community. I’m now journaling almost every day and practicing Dave’s writing philosophy of “pouring” or just letting the words come out without preconceive expectations. I like the philosophy. It’s like what the Bhagavad Gita is preaching:\n\n\u003eYou have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself – without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind. (2:47–48)\n\nJust write. Let it out. Let the words do their magic. Let the Divine within you pour the vessel out.",

    "content": "# Summary\n\n**Nine Magical Steps To Create A New Roadmap**\n\n**Step 1: Making Peace With The Past**\n\nA - How much have you earned in your life? Find out your total life earnings.\n\nB - Find out your net worth by creating a personal balance sheet of assets and liabilities.\n\n**Step 2: Being In The Present - Tracking Your Life Energy**\n\nMoney is something we choose to trade our life energy for.\n\nA - How much are you trading your life energy for? Establish the actual cost in time and money required to maintain your job, and compute your real hourly wage.\n\nYou are in the business of selling the most precious resource in existence — your life energy. You had better know how much you are selling it for.\n\nYour real hourly wage will become a vital ingredient in transforming your relationship with money.\n\nB - Keep track of every cent that comes into or out of your life (Daily Money Log).\n\n**Step 3: Where Is It All Going? (The Monthly Tabulation)**\n\n1. Every month create a table of all income and all expenses within categories generated by your own unique spending pattern.\n2. Balance your monthly income and outgo totals.\n3. Convert ‘dollars’ spent in each category to ‘hours of life energy,’ using your real hourly wage as computed in step 2.\n\nThis monthly tabulation will be an accurate portrait of how you are actually living and provide a foundation for the rest of the program.\n\n**Step 4: Three Questions That Will Transform Your Life**\n\nOn your monthly tabulation, ask three questions of each of your category totals expressed as hours of life energy and record your responses:\n\n1. Did I receive fulfillment, satisfaction and value in proportion to life energy spent?\n2. Is this expenditure of life energy in alignment with my values and life purpose?\n3. How might this expenditure change if I didn’t have to work for a living.\n- Mark a minus [-] or a down arrow if you did not receive fulfillment proportional to the hours of life energy you spent in acquiring the goods and services in that category, or if that expenditure wasn’t in full alignment with your values and purpose or if you could see expenses in that category diminishing after Financial Independence.\n- Mark a plus sign [+] or an up arrow if you believe that upping this expenditure would increase fulfillment, would demonstrate greater personal alignment or would increase after Financial Independence.\n- Mark zero [0] if that category is just fine on all counts.\n\nAsking yourself, month in, month out, whether you actually got fulfillment in proportion to life energy spent in each subcategory awakens the natural sense of knowing when enough is enough.\n\n**Step 5: Making Life Energy Visible**\n\nCreate a large Wall Chart plotting your total monthly income and total monthly expenses from your monthly tabulation. Put it where you will see it every day.\n\n**Step 6: Valuing Your Life Energy — Minimizing Spending**\n\nLearn and practice intelligent use of your life energy (money) which will result in lowering your expenses and increasing your savings. This will create greater fulfillment, integrity and alignment in your life.\n\n**Step 7: Valuing Your Life Energy — Maximizing Income**\n\nRespect the life energy you are putting into your job. Money is simply something you trade your life energy for. Trade it with purpose and integrity for increased earnings.\n\n**Step 8: Capital And The Crossover Point**\n\nEach month apply the following equation to your total accumulated capital, and post the monthly independence income as a separate line on your Wall Chart:\n\nCapital X current long-term interest rate 12 months = monthly investment income\n\n- At the Crossover Point you will be financially independent. The monthly income from your investment capital will be equal to your actual monthly expenses.\n- You will have enough.\n- Your options will be wide open.\n- Celebrate.\n\nStep 9: Managing Your Finances\n\n# 9 - Managing Your Finances\n\nJoe Dominguez’ strategy\n\n- Investing in U.S. treasury bonds to ensure maximum safety of capital and stability of income\n\nNo certainty\n\n- There is no certain and foolproof method for making money effortlessly.\n- “...no investment you make guarantees that geopolitical or economic conditions will not shift or protects you from finding that the nest egg you thought would give you a comfortable income for life . . . won’t. Buyer—of investments—beware.\"\n\nStep 9\n\n- Do your own research and think for yourself to determine which of these investment options is best for you.\n- Become knowledgeable and sophisticated about long-term income-producing investments so that you can manage your finances for a consistent income sufficient to your needs over the long term.\n- Learn enough to free yourself from fear and confusion that pervade the realm of personal investments.\n\n---\n\n**EMPOWER YOURSELF**\n\nStocks\n\n- Your personal fortunes rise and fall with the company’s fortunes.\n\nBonds\n\n- You are loaning money (principal) to a trustworthy institution at the best interest rate you can get for a set period of time, at the end of which you get your money back. All of it.\n\nInvesting is not equal to “more is better”\n\n- You know how much is enough for you.\n- The purpose of your investment program will be to assure yourself that you will have that amount - an then some - for the rest of your life.\n\n**Don’t Just Leave It to the Experts**\n\n- Don’t approach securities brokers for advice. Only use them when you have decided what to buy.\n- For advice, only hire a “fee only” consultant so that your advisor will not benefit financially from any of the specific investments he/she recommends to you.\n- Look for a consultant that supports the principles of YMOYL.\n\nYou and you alone are responsible for investing your money since no one cares about the outcome more than you. But in certain circumstances, hiring a trained professional guide can be very useful.\n\nBecome as knowledgeable as you can regarding your investment options.\n\n**Dispelling Fears**\n\nMost beliefs about investing rest on two primary driving forces\n\n1. Greed\n2. Fear\n\nFear: “Will I continue to have enough money over time?”\n\nHow to whittle this fear:\n\n1. Apply the investment criteria suggested at YMOYL\n2. Establish a reserve according to the guidelines at YMOYL\n3. Dispel the irrational fear of inflation.\n\n**Are Our Fears of Inflation Inflated?**\n\n- The morbid fear of inflation, has blinded us to some basic truths and has greatly distorted our perceptions. The financial industry has been quick to capitalize on this pervasive paranoia—with the resulting proliferation of many dubious “investment” vehicles.\n- At least part of our experience of “inflation” is due to unconscious and automatic habits as well as to our chosen lifestyle, in addition to “the cost of living.\n- CPI does not account for cultural change, technological improvements or creative substitutions. Therefore, the CPI often suggests that the impacts of inflation are much worse than they often actually are.\n- While “inflation” may be a macroeconomic reality, this does not mean that it automatically rules your microeconomic life. Your choices, attitudes, beliefs, habits, tastes, fears and desires can have an enormous effect on your bottom line.\n- Invest in yourself—in your own capacity to solve problems creatively, in your own inventiveness and adaptability, in your own skills and abilities—and you can at least keep hard-core inflation confined to a few areas of life, not sprawling across your whole existence. You don’t need to fear inflation—you just need to manage it rationally.\n- You can hedge inflation more than you might think just through being conscious and making different choices—but not always and not forever.\n\n**Inflation and Investment Returns**\n\nThe ultimate return on any long-term investment is determined by four primary factors:\n\n1. Annual rate of return\n2. Fees\n3. Taxes\n4. Effects of inflation over time\n\nWhen inflation rates are low (3 percent or less), invest in conservative instruments (treasury bonds).\n\nWhen inflation rates are high, consider taking more risk with your money to increase return.\n\nYou don’t want to risk your nest egg. But you are putting it at risk if your investment returns don’t keep pace with inflation.\n\nHow do you manage your money to reduce the risks associated with inflation?\n\n---\n\n**3 PILLARS OF FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE: CAPITAL, CUSHION, AND CACHE**\n\n1. Capital - The sum that is invested, ultimately producing at least as much income as indicated but the Crossover Point.\n2. Cushion - A cash reserve that is enough to cover your expenses for six months. The purpose of the cushion is to handle emergencies and surges in expenses.\n3. Cache (pronounced “cash”): Additional savings beyond core capital or cushion.\n\n**Beginners Steps**\n\n1. Build a cushion (Php 60,000).\n2. After building your cushion, transfer money into long-term investments.\n3. Determine what type of account to use for holding your cushion.\n4. Determine what type of account to use for holding the money that is accumulating, waiting to be invested.\n5. Compare the advantages of federally insured savings accounts, insured interest-paying checking accounts, money market accounts and CDs.\n\n---\n\n**BASIC CRITERIA FOR INVESTING YOUR CAPITAL**\n\nResearch and do homework.\n\nMake smart and sensible decisions regarding your long-term investments.\n\nThe better you understand the options you have available for investing your capital, the more confidence you will have in your decisions.\n\n**Joe’s Basic Criteria**\n\n1. Your capital must produce income.\n2. Your capital must be absolutely safe.\n3. Your capital must be in a totally liquid investment. You must be able to convert it into cash at a moment’s notice, to handle emergencies.\n4. Your capital must not be diminished at the time of investment by unnecessary commissions, “loads,” “promotional” or “distribution” expenses (often called “12b-1 fees”), management fees or expense fees.\n5. Your income must be absolutely safe.\n6. Your income must not fluctuate. You must know exactly what your income will be next month, next year and twenty years from now.\n7. Your income must be payable to you, in cash, at regular intervals; it must not be accrued, deferred, automatically reinvested, etc. You want complete control.\n8. Your income must not be diminished by charges, management fees, redemption fees, etc.\n9. The investment must produce this regular, fixed, known income without any further involvement or expense on your part. It must not require maintenance, management, geographic presence or attention due to “acts of God.\n\nThe investment vehicle that meets these criteria are U.S. treasury bonds.\n\n**Treasury Bonds**\n\n- Ideal for low risk tolerance\n- Protect principal\n- Provide a steady stream of income\n- Relatively easy to understand\n- Exempt from local and state taxes\n- Can be bought and sold almost instantly with minimal handling charges\n- Protected by the government\n\n[www.treasurydirect.gov](http://www.treasurydirect.gov)\n\n**How to buy bonds**\n\nA. Disintermediation\n\n- Buying bonds directly\n- No middleman (fund, bank)\n\nB. Broker\n\n- Buy a bond through a broker for a minimal fee\n\nC. Secondary Market\n\n- Particular interest rate or maturity date for a premium\n- Pay a minimal fee or commission upon purchase\n\nD. Bond Index Fund\n\n- Buy it through a brokerage house\n- As long as the expense ratio is below 0.25 percent\n- Better interest rate even with the slight fee\n- TIPS bond fund\n\nE. Global Bond Funds\n\n- Over half the global marketplace\n- An easy way to diversify your bond portfolio by adding some international exposure\n- [I-shares.com](http://I-shares.com)\n- [troweprice.com](http://troweprice.com)\n- [pimco.com](http://pimco.com)\n\n**Buying foreign bonds**\n\n- Investigate your own nation’s government bonds.\n- The fluctuations in currency exchange rates make the interest income payments unpredictable (only appropriate for more adventurous FI investors)\n\n**Helpful Terms**\n\n- Rate - the annual interest rate that the bond pays you in percentage\n- Maturity or date - when the loan represented by the bond is repaid to you. Interest is paid semiannually on the day and month corresponding to the maturity date and six months later.\n- Bid - the price at which a dealer offers to buy the bond\n- Asked - the price which the dealer offers to sell the bond\n- Chg - change in the bid price (up or down) since the previous day\n- Yld - the yield to maturity in percentage. Current yield adjusted to take into consideration whether you bought it above or below par (the face value of the bond) and thus whether you’ll have a profit or a loss when the bond is repaid.\n\n**Alternatives to Treasury Bonds**\n\n- Putting your whole nest egg in treasury bonds when yields are low means a longer accumulation phase.\n- You may accept a bit more risk by investing part of your nest egg in the stock market as safely as possible.\n\n---\n\n**INVESTMENT OPTIONS**\n\n**Mutual Funds**\n\n- Portfolios of stocks managed by professionals\n- Frequently reflect some investment philosophy\n- Strive for larger returns by investing in specific industries\n- Charge more to compensate for the manager’s increased workload and for the use of their skills and talents\n- They are not guaranteed to increase or to protect an investor’s initial investment\n\n**Index Funds**\n\n- Mutual funds designed to mimic the performance of stock market indices (Dow Industrials, NASDAQ, Composite, S\u0026P 500)\n- Low fees and cost\n- Broad diversification\n- Low portfolio trading activity\n- No traditional active money management\n- No bets on individual stocks\n- Passive investment approach\n- Larger share for investors\n\n**Low Fees**\n\n- Being FI means we know down to the penny the flow of money that comes into and out of our lives, which means that fees—especially low fees—matter to us. By using low-fee index funds as part of your core FI portfolio, you’re applying FI thinking at its best.\n\n**No-Load Funds**\n\n- 401(k), SSS, or PERA has a load\n- If you don’t have a choice where to invest: carefully rearrange your investments to avoid fees for early withdrawal as much as possible\n- When you have a choice: choose firms that offer no-load funds, carry no sales fees (loads) and don’t charge fees to cover marketing expenses\n\n**Actively Managed Funds or Index Funds?**\n\n- Choose index funds\n- “Most investors are better off putting their money in low-cost index funds. A very low-cost index is going to beat a majority of the professionally managed money.”\n- “Regardless of the asset class, use only index or passive asset class funds. Active management is a loser’s game. Diversify across many asset classes. This will reduce portfolio risk and probably increase returns as well.”\n\n**Designing your own “Enough and the Some” FI3 portfolio**\n\nPortfolio\n\n- The sum of your investments across “asset classes” or types of investment vehicles (cash, bonds, stocks, real estate, foreign currency, and commodities)\n\nAsset Allocation\n\n- The art and science of distributing your nest egg across various classes to balance risk and reward.\n- Wisely limiting your market risk by spreading your money across various asset classes.\n- This is a smart, sensible and time-tested strategy.\n\nIndex Funds\n\n- By using index funds, you can allocate your capital across various asset classes. This enables you to reduce volatility without giving up investment performance.\n\n**Lifestyle Funds**\n\n- A kind of mutual fund\n- Management fees are low\n- Plan is simple to manage\n- Enables inexperienced investors to quickly establish a well-diversified portfolio that reduces market risk\n- With the purchase of one mutual fund, you end up owning five funds spread across a variety of asset classes\n- Takes the guesswork out of where and how to invest your capital\n- Enables you to pick the asset allocation that fits your long-term investment objective.\n- The fund automatically rebalances to maintain a consistent allocation among stocks, bonds and short-term investments.\n\n**Mark’s Vanguard FI Investment Strategy**\n\nA.

An ultra billionaire\n2. A lighthearted, productive, free person who never have to worry about money again\n\n—\n\nUniversal happiness buttons\n\n- Friendship\n- Health\n- Community\n- Overcoming challenges with your own ingenuity\n- Feeling in control\n\nMoney is not part of these universal happiness buttons. But it facilitates these buttons.\n\n—\n\nAspire to get better slowly by repeating small steps every day.\n\nAspire not just to improve your financial picture. Aspire to improve you.\n\n—\n\nThe amount of money you have or don’t have is just a symptom\n\nThe root of the problem is this:\n\n1. Your personal beliefs about money\n2. Your personal habits on money\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe goal of the program is this:\n\n- To liberate your most precious resource—your time—to make room for more happiness, more freedom, and more meaning.\n\n—\n\nTo get towards that goal, your need to:\n\n- Transform your relationship with money\n- Achieve Financial Independence\n\n—\n\nWhat does it mean to transform your relationship with money?\n\n- It means knowing how much is enough money for you to have a life you love, now and in the future.\n- It means shifting from being a victim of money and the economy to making conscious choices.\n\n—\n\nWhat does Finacial Independence mean?\n\n- It means no longer having to work for money.\n\n—\n\nWhat does this process look like?\n\n1. You will be freed from the illusion that buying stuff will make you happy or that more is always better.\n2. You see clearly the thoughts driving your money patterns that the patterns themselves evaporate.\n3. As you apply the steps in the program, which involve increasing your income and cutting your expenses, you generate money you can use to pay of your debts.\n4. After paying off your debts, you naturally build up savings as you continue to apply the steps.\n5. Since you have savings, you no longer panic with unexpected expenses.\n6. Since saving has become a habit, you save more and more.\n7. Eventually, you have enough savings that you can start investing.\n8. Your invested money grows by itself giving you the power to choose whether to work for love or money.\n\n—\n\nEnough is what we aspire to.\n\nHaving more is an endless horizon.\n\n—\n\nTo define what your enough is, you need to ask yourself:\n\n- What makes you happy?\n- What’s most important to you?\n- What values will you never compromise?\n- If you had $1 million right now, what would you do with your time?\n- What’s one thing you could get rid of to make yourself happier? (A person doesn’t count.)\n- Will you ever have enough money to retire?\n- If someone today erased all your debts, would you dig yourself into that hole again? How or how not?\n\n—\n\nSuccessful FIers share two qualities to succeed:\n\n1. A purpose for their lives that’s greater than their current limited circumstance—including their jobs\n2. A willingness to do the work of change, to tell the truth, to be accountable, and to persist\n\n—\n\nPeople who follow this program are called FIers (FI means four things: Financial Intelligence, Financial Integrity, Financial Independence, Financial Interdependence).\n\nA similar movement emerged from the original FIers: the FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early)\n\n—\n\nThree strands of the FIRE movement\n\n1. Frugality\n2. Simplicity\n3. Self-sufficiency\n\n—\n\nOther qualities of people who succeed:\n\n- Accountability\n- Self-awareness\n- Empowerment\n\n—\n\nTwo styles in following the program\n\n1. Turtles - Use the program slowly, steadily, and methodically.\n2. Hares - Set a deadline for motivation. Save more to retire as early as possible.\n\nWhatever style you choose, the key is to start and keep going.\n\n—\n\nFinancial Intelligence\n\nThe ability to step back from your assumptions and your emotions about  money and observe them objectively.\n\nIt begins with knowing:\n\n- how much money you already have earned\n- how much money was left from all that you earned\n- how much is coming into your life\n- how much is going out of your life\n\nIt also involves understanding what money really is and what you are trading for the money in your life.\n\n—\n\nFinancial Integrity\n\nAchieved by learning the true impact of your earning and spending on you, your family, and the planet.\n\nIt involves knowing what is enough money and material needs you need to keep you at the peak of fulfillment.\n\nIt involves knowing what is excess and clutter.\n\nIt means your financial life is in alignment with your values.\n\n—\n\nFinancial Independence\n\nBeing free from a dependence on money to handle your life.\n\n—\n\nFinancial Interdependence\n\nHelping make the world a better place AFTER achieving financial independence and pursuing your dreams.\n\n# Chapter 1: The Money Trap: The Old Road Map for Money\n\nThere is a way to live an authentic, productive, meaningful life—and have all the material comforts you want or need. There is a way to balance your inner and outer lives, to have your job self be on good terms with your family self and your deeper self. There is a way to go about the task of making a living so that you end up more alive.\n\nYou can choose both money and life.\n\n—\n\nOne needs to think about what life is outside a money-generating job. Because even the best jobs have trade-offs. There is a larger arena we could enjoy, one that is beyond tthe world of 9-5. It is possible to do work we love with no limitations or restraints and no fear of getting fired or losing clients.\n\n—\n\nSome people are too psychologically attached to a bad job (for identity and self-worth) that they don’t leave even if they are financially capable of doing so.\n\nOur jobs have replaced family, neighborhood, civic affairs, church, and even partners as our primary allegiance, our principal source of love and site of self-expression.\n\n—\n\nJobism\n\nA hidden hierarchy in society that categorizes people based on what they do for money.\n\n—\n\nWe are working more, but enjoying life less.\n\nOn top of that, we are not saving more.\n\n---\n\nInvest in passively managed, low-fee index funds diversified over a few asset classes and hold them for many years.\n\nDiversify your index funds across asset classes.\n\n- Stocks\n- Bonds\n- Domestic\n- International\n- Large, medium, or small capital funds\n\n# References\n\nRobin, V., Dominguez, J., \u0026 Mustache, M.

    "content": "\nThe goal of the program is to maximize the happiness you get from every hour of your life energy spent.\n\nThe program uses a whole-systems approach, so all the nine steps should be applied conscientiously at the same time.\n\n# Step 1: Making Peace with the Past\n\nHow much have you earned in your life?\n\nFind out your total lifetime earnings—the sum total of your gross income, from the first penny you ever earned to your most recent paycheck.\n\nWhat have you got to show for it?\n\nFind out your net worth by creating a personal balance sheet of assets and liabilities—everything you own and everything you owe.\n\n# Step 2: Being in the Present—Tracking Your Life Energy\n\nHow much money are you making for the amount of time (life energy) you work?\n\n**Establish the actual costs in time and money required to maintain your job, and compute your real hourly wage.**\n\nIf you are a freelancer, subject each gig to the same analysis.\n\nThink of all the ways you use your life energy that are directly related to your money-earning employment. Think of all the monetary expenses that are directly associated with the job. In other words, if you didn’t need that money-earning job, what time expenditures and monetary expenses would disappear from your life?\n\nUse the following categories and add others:\n\n- Commuting = __ hours/week; __ pesos/week\n- Costuming (clothes) = __ hours/week; __ pesos/week\n- Meals = __ hours/week; __ pesos\n- Daily decompression = __ hours/week; __ pesos/week\n- Escape entertainment = __ hours/week; __ pesos/week\n- Vacations = __ hours/week; __ pesos/week\n- Job-related illness = __ hours/week; __ pesos/week\n- Other job-related expenses = __ hours/week; __ pesos/week\n\nTotal all the hours of extra job-related hours. Add them to your normal workweek hours. This is your Adjusted Work Time.\n\nTotal all the money from job-related expenses and subtract them from your earnings on that specific project. This is your Adjusted Salary.\n\nDivide  Adjusted Salary with Adjusted Work-Time. This is your Real Hourly Wage.\n\nKeep track of every cent that comes into or goes out of your life.\n\n# Step 3: Where Is It All Going? (The Monthly Tabulation)\n\nEvery month, total all expenses within categories generated by your own unique spending pattern. Then total income.\n\nConvert dollars spent in each category to “hours of life energy,” using your real hourly wage as computed in step 2.\n\n# Step 4: Three Questions That Will Transform Your Life\n\nOn your Monthly Tabulation, ask these three questions of each of your category totals expressed as hours of life energy and record your responses:\n\n1. Did I receive fulfillment, satisfaction, and value in proportion to life energy spent?\n2. Is this expenditure of life energy in alignment with my values and life purpose?\n3. How might this expenditure change if I didn’t have to work for money? For each question in each category, evaluate whether the expense should increase, decrease, or stay the same for your optimal fulfillment. This is the heart of the program.”\n\n# Step 5: Making Life Energy Visible\n\nCreate a large Wall (or Online) Chart plotting the total monthly income and total monthly expenses from your Monthly Tabulation. Put it where you will see it every day.”\n\n# Step 6: Valuing Your Life Energy—Minimizing Spending\n\nLearn and practice intelligent use of your life energy (money), which will result in lowering your expenses and increasing your savings. This will create greater fulfillment, integrity, and alignment in your life.\n\n# Step 7: Valuing Your Life Energy—Maximizing Income\n\nRespect the life energy you are putting into your job. Money is simply something you trade your life energy for. Trade it with purpose and integrity for increased earnings.\n\n# Step 8: Capital and the Crossover Point\n\nEach month apply the following equation to your total accumulated capital, and post the monthly independence income as a separate line on your Wall Chart:\n\ncapital x current long-term interest rate / 12 months = monthly investment income\n\n# Step 9: Investing for FI\n\nBecome knowledgeable and sophisticated about income-producing investments that can provide a consistent income sufficient for your needs over the long term.\n\nSet up your financial plan using the three pillars:\n\n- Capital: The income-producing core of your Financial Independence\n- Cushion: Enough ready cash, earning bank interest, to cover six months of expenses\n- Cache: The surplus of funds resulting from your continued practice of the nine steps”\n\n# Your Money or Your Life\n\n# Summary\n\n**Nine Magical Steps To Create A New Roadmap**\n\n**Step 1: Making Peace With The Past**\n\nA - How much have you earned in your life? Find out your total life earnings.\n\nB - Find out your net worth by creating a personal balance sheet of assets and liabilities.\n\n**Step 2: Being In The Present - Tracking Your Life Energy**\n\nMoney is something we choose to trade our life energy for.\n\nA - How much are you trading your life energy for? Establish the actual cost in time and money required to maintain your job, and compute your real hourly wage.\n\nYou are in the business of selling the most precious resource in existence — your life energy. You had better know how much you are selling it for.\n\nYour real hourly wage will become a vital ingredient in transforming your relationship with money.\n\nB - Keep track of every cent that comes into or out of your life (Daily Money Log).\n\n**Step 3: Where Is It All Going? (The Monthly Tabulation)**\n\n1. Every month create a table of all income and all expenses within categories generated by your own unique spending pattern.\n2. Balance your monthly income and outgo totals.\n3. Convert ‘dollars’ spent in each category to ‘hours of life energy,’ using your real hourly wage as computed in step 2.\n\nThis monthly tabulation will be an accurate portrait of how you are actually living and provide a foundation for the rest of the program.\n\n**Step 4: Three Questions That Will Transform Your Life**\n\nOn your monthly tabulation, ask three questions of each of your category totals expressed as hours of life energy and record your responses:\n\n1. Did I receive fulfillment, satisfaction and value in proportion to life energy spent?\n2. Is this expenditure of life energy in alignment with my values and life purpose?\n3. How might this expenditure change if I didn’t have to work for a living.\n- Mark a minus [-] or a down arrow if you did not receive fulfillment proportional to the hours of life energy you spent in acquiring the goods and services in that category, or if that expenditure wasn’t in full alignment with your values and purpose or if you could see expenses in that category diminishing after Financial Independence.\n- Mark a plus sign [+] or an up arrow if you believe that upping this expenditure would increase fulfillment, would demonstrate greater personal alignment or would increase after Financial Independence.\n- Mark zero [0] if that category is just fine on all counts.\n\nAsking yourself, month in, month out, whether you actually got fulfillment in proportion to life energy spent in each subcategory awakens the natural sense of knowing when enough is enough.\n\n**Step 5: Making Life Energy Visible**\n\nCreate a large Wall Chart plotting your total monthly income and total monthly expenses from your monthly tabulation. Put it where you will see it every day.\n\n**Step 6: Valuing Your Life Energy — Minimizing Spending**\n\nLearn and practice intelligent use of your life energy (money) which will result in lowering your expenses and increasing your savings. This will create greater fulfillment, integrity and alignment in your life.\n\n**Step 7: Valuing Your Life Energy — Maximizing Income**\n\nRespect the life energy you are putting into your job. Money is simply something you trade your life energy for. Trade it with purpose and integrity for increased earnings.\n\n**Step 8: Capital And The Crossover Point**\n\nEach month apply the following equation to your total accumulated capital, and post the monthly independence income as a separate line on your Wall Chart:\n\nCapital X current long-term interest rate 12 months = monthly investment income\n\n- At the Crossover Point you will be financially independent. The monthly income from your investment capital will be equal to your actual monthly expenses.\n- You will have enough.\n- Your options will be wide open.\n- Celebrate.\n\nStep 9: Managing Your Finances\n\n# 9 - Managing Your Finances\n\nJoe Dominguez’ strategy\n\n- Investing in U.S. treasury bonds to ensure maximum safety of capital and stability of income\n\nNo certainty\n\n- There is no certain and foolproof method for making money effortlessly.\n- “...no investment you make guarantees that geopolitical or economic conditions will not shift or protects you from finding that the nest egg you thought would give you a comfortable income for life . . . won’t. Buyer—of investments—beware.\"\n\nStep 9\n\n- Do your own research and think for yourself to determine which of these investment options is best for you.\n- Become knowledgeable and sophisticated about long-term income-producing investments so that you can manage your finances for a consistent income sufficient to your needs over the long term.\n- Learn enough to free yourself from fear and confusion that pervade the realm of personal investments.\n\n---\n\n**EMPOWER YOURSELF**\n\nStocks\n\n- Your personal fortunes rise and fall with the company’s fortunes.\n\nBonds\n\n- You are loaning money (principal) to a trustworthy institution at the best interest rate you can get for a set period of time, at the end of which you get your money back. All of it.\n\nInvesting is not equal to “more is better”\n\n- You know how much is enough for you.\n- The purpose of your investment program will be to assure yourself that you will have that amount - an then some - for the rest of your life.\n\n**Don’t Just Leave It to the Experts**\n\n- Don’t approach securities brokers for advice. Only use them when you have decided what to buy.\n- For advice, only hire a “fee only” consultant so that your advisor will not benefit financially from any of the specific investments he/she recommends to you.\n- Look for a consultant that supports the principles of YMOYL.\n\nYou and you alone are responsible for investing your money since no one cares about the outcome more than you. But in certain circumstances, hiring a trained professional guide can be very useful.\n\nBecome as knowledgeable as you can regarding your investment options.\n\n**Dispelling Fears**\n\nMost beliefs about investing rest on two primary driving forces\n\n1. Greed\n2. Fear\n\nFear: “Will I continue to have enough money over time?”\n\nHow to whittle this fear:\n\n1. Apply the investment criteria suggested at YMOYL\n2. Establish a reserve according to the guidelines at YMOYL\n3. Dispel the irrational fear of inflation.\n\n**Are Our Fears of Inflation Inflated?**\n\n- The morbid fear of inflation, has blinded us to some basic truths and has greatly distorted our perceptions. The financial industry has been quick to capitalize on this pervasive paranoia—with the resulting proliferation of many dubious “investment” vehicles.\n- At least part of our experience of “inflation” is due to unconscious and automatic habits as well as to our chosen lifestyle, in addition to “the cost of living.\n- CPI does not account for cultural change, technological improvements or creative substitutions. Therefore, the CPI often suggests that the impacts of inflation are much worse than they often actually are.\n- While “inflation” may be a macroeconomic reality, this does not mean that it automatically rules your microeconomic life. Your choices, attitudes, beliefs, habits, tastes, fears and desires can have an enormous effect on your bottom line.\n- Invest in yourself—in your own capacity to solve problems creatively, in your own inventiveness and adaptability, in your own skills and abilities—and you can at least keep hard-core inflation confined to a few areas of life, not sprawling across your whole existence. You don’t need to fear inflation—you just need to manage it rationally.\n- You can hedge inflation more than you might think just through being conscious and making different choices—but not always and not forever.\n\n**Inflation and Investment Returns**\n\nThe ultimate return on any long-term investment is determined by four primary factors:\n\n1. Annual rate of return\n2. Fees\n3. Taxes\n4. Effects of inflation over time\n\nWhen inflation rates are low (3 percent or less), invest in conservative instruments (treasury bonds).\n\nWhen inflation rates are high, consider taking more risk with your money to increase return.\n\nYou don’t want to risk your nest egg. But you are putting it at risk if your investment returns don’t keep pace with inflation.\n\nHow do you manage your money to reduce the risks associated with inflation?\n\n---\n\n**3 PILLARS OF FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE: CAPITAL, CUSHION, AND CACHE**\n\n1. Capital - The sum that is invested, ultimately producing at least as much income as indicated but the Crossover Point.\n2. Cushion - A cash reserve that is enough to cover your expenses for six months. The purpose of the cushion is to handle emergencies and surges in expenses.\n3. Cache (pronounced “cash”): Additional savings beyond core capital or cushion.\n\n**Beginners Steps**\n\n1. Build a cushion (Php 60,000).\n2. After building your cushion, transfer money into long-term investments.\n3. Determine what type of account to use for holding your cushion.\n4. Determine what type of account to use for holding the money that is accumulating, waiting to be invested.\n5. Compare the advantages of federally insured savings accounts, insured interest-paying checking accounts, money market accounts and CDs.\n\n---\n\n**BASIC CRITERIA FOR INVESTING YOUR CAPITAL**\n\nResearch and do homework.\n\nMake smart and sensible decisions regarding your long-term investments.\n\nThe better you understand the options you have available for investing your capital, the more confidence you will have in your decisions.\n\n**Joe’s Basic Criteria**\n\n1. Your capital must produce income.\n2. Your capital must be absolutely safe.\n3. Your capital must be in a totally liquid investment. You must be able to convert it into cash at a moment’s notice, to handle emergencies.\n4. Your capital must not be diminished at the time of investment by unnecessary commissions, “loads,” “promotional” or “distribution” expenses (often called “12b-1 fees”), management fees or expense fees.\n5. Your income must be absolutely safe.\n6. Your income must not fluctuate. You must know exactly what your income will be next month, next year and twenty years from now.\n7. Your income must be payable to you, in cash, at regular intervals; it must not be accrued, deferred, automatically reinvested, etc. You want complete control.\n8. Your income must not be diminished by charges, management fees, redemption fees, etc.\n9. The investment must produce this regular, fixed, known income without any further involvement or expense on your part. It must not require maintenance, management, geographic presence or attention due to “acts of God.\n\nThe investment vehicle that meets these criteria are U.S. treasury bonds.\n\n**Treasury Bonds**\n\n- Ideal for low risk tolerance\n- Protect principal\n- Provide a steady stream of income\n- Relatively easy to understand\n- Exempt from local and state taxes\n- Can be bought and sold almost instantly with minimal handling charges\n- Protected by the government\n\n[www.treasurydirect.gov](http://www.treasurydirect.gov)\n\n**How to buy bonds**\n\nA.

Interest is paid semiannually on the day and month corresponding to the maturity date and six months later.\n- Bid - the price at which a dealer offers to buy the bond\n- Asked - the price which the dealer offers to sell the bond\n- Chg - change in the bid price (up or down) since the previous day\n- Yld - the yield to maturity in percentage. Current yield adjusted to take into consideration whether you bought it above or below par (the face value of the bond) and thus whether you’ll have a profit or a loss when the bond is repaid.\n\n**Alternatives to Treasury Bonds**\n\n- Putting your whole nest egg in treasury bonds when yields are low means a longer accumulation phase.\n- You may accept a bit more risk by investing part of your nest egg in the stock market as safely as possible.\n\n---\n\n**INVESTMENT OPTIONS**\n\n**Mutual Funds**\n\n- Portfolios of stocks managed by professionals\n- Frequently reflect some investment philosophy\n- Strive for larger returns by investing in specific industries\n- Charge more to compensate for the manager’s increased workload and for the use of their skills and talents\n- They are not guaranteed to increase or to protect an investor’s initial investment\n\n**Index Funds**\n\n- Mutual funds designed to mimic the performance of stock market indices (Dow Industrials, NASDAQ, Composite, S\u0026P 500)\n- Low fees and cost\n- Broad diversification\n- Low portfolio trading activity\n- No traditional active money management\n- No bets on individual stocks\n- Passive investment approach\n- Larger share for investors\n\n**Low Fees**\n\n- Being FI means we know down to the penny the flow of money that comes into and out of our lives, which means that fees—especially low fees—matter to us. By using low-fee index funds as part of your core FI portfolio, you’re applying FI thinking at its best.\n\n**No-Load Funds**\n\n- 401(k), SSS, or PERA has a load\n- If you don’t have a choice where to invest: carefully rearrange your investments to avoid fees for early withdrawal as much as possible\n- When you have a choice: choose firms that offer no-load funds, carry no sales fees (loads) and don’t charge fees to cover marketing expenses\n\n**Actively Managed Funds or Index Funds?**\n\n- Choose index funds\n- “Most investors are better off putting their money in low-cost index funds. A very low-cost index is going to beat a majority of the professionally managed money.”\n- “Regardless of the asset class, use only index or passive asset class funds. Active management is a loser’s game. Diversify across many asset classes. This will reduce portfolio risk and probably increase returns as well.”\n\n**Designing your own “Enough and the Some” FI3 portfolio**\n\nPortfolio\n\n- The sum of your investments across “asset classes” or types of investment vehicles (cash, bonds, stocks, real estate, foreign currency, and commodities)\n\nAsset Allocation\n\n- The art and science of distributing your nest egg across various classes to balance risk and reward.\n- Wisely limiting your market risk by spreading your money across various asset classes.\n- This is a smart, sensible and time-tested strategy.\n\nIndex Funds\n\n- By using index funds, you can allocate your capital across various asset classes. This enables you to reduce volatility without giving up investment performance.\n\n**Lifestyle Funds**\n\n- A kind of mutual fund\n- Management fees are low\n- Plan is simple to manage\n- Enables inexperienced investors to quickly establish a well-diversified portfolio that reduces market risk\n- With the purchase of one mutual fund, you end up owning five funds spread across a variety of asset classes\n- Takes the guesswork out of where and how to invest your capital\n- Enables you to pick the asset allocation that fits your long-term investment objective.\n- The fund automatically rebalances to maintain a consistent allocation among stocks, bonds and short-term investments.\n\n**Mark’s Vanguard FI Investment Strategy**\n\nA. Retirement (Life-Strategy Income Fund)\n\nSeeks current income and has some growth of capital\n\n60% to bonds\n\n20% to short-term reserves\n\n20% to common stocks\n\nB. Balanced (Life-Strategy Conservative Growth Fund)\n\nBalances your need for long-term growth of capital along with your need for income\n\nWell-suited for investors at all stages of their journey to FI\n\n40% to bonds\n\n20% to short-term fixed income reserves\n\n40% to common stocks\n\nC. Moderate Growth (Life-Strategy Moderate Growth Fund)\n\nHigher allocation to stocks (more potential for growth but more risk)\n\n60% to common stocks\n\n40% to bonds\n\nD. Riskier ((Life-Strategy Growth Fund)\n\nInvest during nest-egg accumulation phase\n\nSeek long-term growth of capital with some income\n\nYounger FIers\n\nWilling to tolerate more risk\n\n80% to common stocks\n\n20% to bonds\n\n**SRI**\n\n- Socially responsible investing\n- Merges quest for financial independence with humanitarian or environmental values\n- [socialinvest.org](http://socialinvest.org)\n- Expressing your environmental and social justice values (being good) doesn’t guarantee that you’ll maximize your income (doing well).\n- Do your research.\n- In general, funds with lower costs, more diversification and screening that matches your values will be your best bets.\n\n---\n\n**CHECKLIST OF THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN INVESTING**\n\nIs this investment in line with my values?\n\nWhat are the federal, state and local tax implications of this investment for me? (Is it tax efficient for my income bracket or situation?)\n\nHow easily can I liquidate (sell out of) all or part of this investment?\n\nWhat sales charges/penalties (if any) will I incur in getting into or out of this investment?\n\nDoes this provide the current/future income I need\n\nDoes this provide overall diversification for my investments?\n\nIs this investment in line with my tolerance for risk?\n\n---\n\n**OTHER INVESTMENTS**\n\nReal Estate\n\nCommunity\n\n- Invest in community\n- Loan money to friends at an interest rate that’s better for you than bonds but lower for them than a bank\n- Invest in a local business rather than making a loan\n\n---\n\n**CUSHION**\n\n- 6 months of monthly expenses\n- Readily available in a bank account or a money market fund\n- Handle spikes in expenses\n- Eases concern about consciousness growing faster than inflation\n- Your cushion will be there to handle the “what if’” worries, either by proving them unfounded or by providing the cash needed to see you through.\n\n---\n\n**CACHE**\n\nIn your FI program, your cache is a store of extra money (beyond your capital or your cushion) that builds up for future use. Funds feeding the cache account come from numerous sources.\n\n**Sources**\n\n- Savings from a lifestyle with no paid employment\n- Savings from continuous application of FI principles while income continuous to increase\n- Savings from not buying new material possessions\n- Savings from no taxes\n- Incidental income\n- Paid employment\n\n**How to Spend Cache**\n\n- You do not need this for your everyday living expenses\n- Psychological function (you have enough and then some) helping to quell any lingering “what ifs.\"\n- Handles the shortfall during inflation.\n- It is from this fund that you can replace major items necessary to your chosen lifestyle when they finally do wear out.\n- Projects and causes that you participate in may need an infusion of capital to achieve a specific objective; you can provide that capital without damaging your ability to provide that most valuable of contributions, your undivided life energy.\n- Your cache is a living resource, not a one-time bundle that you will deplete.\n\n# 8 - The Crossover Point: The Pot of Gold at the End of the Wall Chart\n\n[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6\u0026q=14.674744,121.054899)\n\n**SAVINGS VERSUS CAPITAL**\n\n**Capital**\n\n- The gap between your income and your expenses becomes savings which in turn becomes capital.\n- Money that produces an income as surely as your job produces income\n\n**2 basic forms of investment**\n\n1. Speculation\n2. Debt Instruments (Loans)\n\n---\n\n**STEP 8: CAPITAL AND THE CROSSOVER POINT**\n\n**Monthly Investment Income**\n\n- The income you receive from your capital.\n- It comes in whether or not you go to work.\n- Enter it separately on your Wall Chart.\n- Formula: capital x long-term interest rate / 12 months = monthly investment income\n- Apply the formula to your total accumulated savings each month\n\n**Total Accumulated Capital**\n\n- Savings that you are not planning to spend.\n\n**Current Interest Rate**\n\n- Use the current yield of long-term\n\n---\n\n**THE CROSSOVER POINT**\n\n- That point in the foreseeable future when your total monthly expenses and monthly investment income crosses.\n- Income from your investment capital is higher that your monthly expenses.\n- At this point, you have Financial Independence. You will have a safe, steady income for life from a source other than a job.\n- Your monthly investment income covers your basic life necessities and all the components of your chosen lifestyle.\n- Once you’ve passed the Crossover Point you have choice about how you fill the hours of your day and the days of your productive life. You are free to invent your life.\n\n---\n\n**THE POWER OF WORKING FOR A FINITE PERIOD OF TIME**\n\n- Wouldn’t you feel like putting a lot more of yourself into that job, knowing that it’s only for a limited period of time? Wouldn’t it make the boredom more bearable and the challenges more interesting?\n- Knowing that you will only work for a finite and foreseeable period of time will make you an even more highly motivated, high-integrity worker.\n- Concentrate on making money now so that you don’t have to make money later.\n- Commit yourself to intensively earning money (without selling out your integrity or endangering your health) for a limited period of time.\n\n**2 Rockets of FI**\n\n- Primary Rocket: Aligning your earning and spending with your values and with what brings you true fulfillment.\n- Secondary Rocket: The concept of working for a finite period of time.\n\n---\n\n**FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE: HAVING ENOUGH - AND THEN SOME**\n\n“And then some”\n\n- Helps you feel totally comfortable to rely on your monthly investment income.\n- Your FI lifestyle will cost less than your job-associated lifestyle.\n- The money you save from this effect becomes your “and then some.”\n- You can track this “and then some” income by putting a fourth line on your Wall Chart.\n- Remember: your Wall Chart is a powerful antidote to anxiety about the future.\n\n---\n\n**YOU CAN STOP WORKING FOR MONEY**\n\n- You don’t need to stop working for money but you can.\n- Not working for money is not part of the FI program. It is an individual and personal choice.\n- You can volunteer and not tie yourself to a salary and the compromises that tend to go along with it.\n- You can work for money approaching it in a whole new way.\n- Work can not be a process of discovering how to express your understanding of what life is rather than trying to make more money.\n- Time with family and friends.\n- Personal time\n\n---\n\n**VOLUNTARY ACTION: THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE WHAT YOU DO AND DO WHAT YOU CHOOSE**\n\nWorking after FI is a choice, no longer an obligation.\n\nWork is done anticipating fulfillment, not money.\n\nVoluntary action can serve your values and your chosen purpose.\n\n**Volunteers**\n\n- Free to act whenever, wherever, and however they choose\n- They work for their values and their deepest believes about life\n- They work for love, not money\n- They can venture into projects that later one provide job opportunities to others\n- Because they are not paid professionals, volunteers can be experimental and intuitive.\n- Volunteers are powerful by virtue of being free.\n\n**Amplifying Fulfillment through Volunteerism**\n\n*2 choices at the point of maximum fulfillment*\n\n1. **Consume.** Continue working for your needs and desires (buy possessions and experiences).\n2. **Create.** Work for something larger than yourself that gives to others and the world.\n\n*How to heighten fulfillment*\n\n- Once you have enough, it’s the commitment to giving that takes that fulfillment line straight up off the top of the chart.\n- Make a contribution through service.\n- The accumulation that constitutes your “enough” is about getting. The freedom above the peak is about giving—via work, attention, care and presence.\n\n![YMOYL-fulfillment-curve.png](YMOYL-fulfillment-curve.png)\n\nFreedoms of volunteering\n\n- The freedom to do the kind of work you choose whether or not you have the credentials and whether or not you get paid for it.\n- The freedom to speak the truth and never bend your principles for the sake of job security.\n- The freedom to structure your time in a way that best works for you.\n- The freedom to continue using the skills you already have and are comfortable with or to push yourself to learn new ones.\n\n# References\n\nRobin, V., Dominguez, J., \u0026 Mustache, M.

But then describes what is happening now, today, as a point of reference or return (p. 7).\n- She includes flashbacks or memories (p. 7), which suggests she really is recording stuff.\n- She describes something before naming it, creating suspense and mystery (e.g., the giant water bug, p. 8).\n- In some areas she starts to sermon. This is her channeling Thoreau (p. 9).\n- She tries to write her philosphical thoughts but uses poetic language and metaphors (p. 11).\n- She is excellent in describing the landscape (p. 11).\n- She also describes a lengthier phenomena like sunset (p. 11).\n- She uses short simple sentences.\n- She uses disgression.\n- She inserts real scientific descriptions.\n- She inserts real anthropological accounts.

    "content": "\nI don't usually have breakfast, but I ate one today because I will be walking for around 45 minutes from our house at Cablong to the land at Banaoag that Tito Bobby bought and is developing through Papa's assistance.\n\nBefore leaving, I tried to bond with the new dog, Moymoy, which Papa bought. He is a shy dog. Then I started walking at Balon Dalan. I saw an old lady asking a little boy to do something. Aya ay upam ya ah? Apuram. The boy started walking. But the old lady ran towards him and pushed him. Apuram. She said again. The boy started running. The boy passed by an adolescent female. She asked her, \"Are you doing laundry?\" in a tone that was as if he was talking to a child (a child talking to a child). The adolescent female was a PWD. The boy then passed by a group of children, possibly friends, and they started teasing him with words I couldn't understand.\n\nAt the Urdaneta–Dagupan Road, I noticed for the first time, scales that seem to measure the water level on the posts at the left road. It says from above to bottom:\n- FORCED EVACUATION\n- FULL EVACUATION\n- PRE-EMPTIVE EVACUATION\n- ALERT LEVEL\n- ALARM PHASE\n\nPerhaps flooding happens here, which makes me concern about the land at Banaoang, which was very near the river.\n\nMy only concern about this scale system is that why would I wait for the water to reach that high before I force people out of the place, when evacuation via land vehicle is difficult and only a chopper or boat (?) can be done.\n\nFrom afar I peeked at the Presidential Hotel, which does not seem to appear at Google Maps.\n\nOn the other side of the road, an abandoned house piqued my interest. I took a picture of it across the road but I wanted to take a closer look so I crossed the street.\n\nThe abandoned house was filled with artwork—paintings, not grafittis. The house a work of wonderful art.\n\nTito Bob called so I continued walking. I took a photo of this abandoned store, with Coca Cola painting. This came from a distand past when advertisers were willing to paint stores. Now they just provide signboards or tarps. No longer the dedication they once showed.\n\nI took photos of signs along the way: a sipsip pozo negro sign and an upside down piso net sign.\n\nWhen I entered the land at the gate, a family of pabo (turkey) welcomed me. I took some more photos of what was happening inside the land.\n\n# References",

    "content": "\n# My observations\n\nRofel's poems are lyrical in that the first person is there. However, they are not egotistical. They don't ask for attention. They have an element of transforming the reader into the owner of the poem. The poem is highligted not the poet. Because it is simple and lacks the showcasing of skills that are typical of poems.\n\nThe people who attended Rofel's book launch were family, colleagues, students, and fans like us. There seem lots of family and friends that one gets the immediate feeling that the main audience of this poet is his family and friends. And this makes a lot of sense. He is his first audience of his own work and he doesn't really take his writing seriously. He writes if he things what he'll write about matters whether there is one or two readers. If a writer thinks this way then his readers will have faces. He will know each of them and have a relationship with each of them. He invests in these relationships and nuture them. His audience is not a faceless collective that are marketed upon.\n\n---\n# Notes from the podcast interview\n\nPeople feel like they are the most important person in the world when they talk to him.\n\nHe became a teacher to Jesuits. This is where he learned how to listen.\n\nHe has been guiding people even before he had a seminar in spiritual accompaniment.\n\nThis is what he does outside poetry.\n\nHe can talk to young people. He has a father in him. He doesn't have kids.\n\nHe was coasting along. He didn't have a job. He chose economics because it was cool.\n\nHe didnt plan his life.\n\nCity gov san pablo first job for 6 months\n\nStarted business with friends\n\n## Poetry\n\n25: I really need to go to first love, literature. He studied lit.\n\nStudent of rolando tinio\n\nHe was a bum at 22. His father bought him a typewriter. He wrote some lines. He realized it was poetry. He sent four to a magazine. They published 1.\n\n3 years later when he went back to school to study. He enrolled to a class of a teacher 5 years older than him. His only published poem was in the syllabus. The teacher has been using the poem for 3 years. The teacher nurtured her. They gave each other poems on their desks.\n\n28: joined a national contest for below 30 and no national award for poetry. He has 10 poems and he won unanimously. Jose Lacaba. His idol. When he can't write poetry, he reads Lacaba and words start to come out.\n\nHe is a lazy poet. His poetry short and simple. The readers were the ones who made the writings poems. When people said it.\n\nPeople will see things in your poem that you didn't intend to be there.\n\nPoetry is like giving birth to a child. Once it is out it has a life of its own.\n\nHe write because he cannot paint, draw, and take photos. To be creative.\n\nThere is something in me that wants to come out. I dont know what it is but I want it to come out.\n\nHis writing was self-centered. He wasn't writing for others. He writes during retreats so his poetry becomes prayers.\n\nHe is a lazy writer. He doesn't sit down to write poems. He wrote poems when he is low before. It came to a point when he had to be alone to write. His poems became about nature. Moments. They are image poems not idea poems. Haikus. So zen.\n\nPoetry is like photography. Little reflection. The reader is the one who reflects. Eventually he intentionally chose words to urge the reader to reflect. But the process really was let the words come. He had to be quiet.\n\nWhen he was starting out he can write when people was around him. He can only write when handwriting them. He doesnt have drafts. Now he can write even in the computer.\n\nHe doesn't feel stuck. No writer's block.\n\nWhen he writes he doesnt see himself as a writer. He doesnt take himself seriously. If he cant write he does other things.\n\nWriting is not a big deal. But it later became a big deal because it afforded him to travel.\n\nHe doesnt write a lot and it doesnt even bothers him. During retreats he can write a hundred. Verses.\n\nHe doesnt care if he will be plagiarized or not. Our forefathers wrote without caring. Poetry was to help others. It was ritualistic. Ambahan mangyans did not even take ownership of the poem. It was communal.\n\nHe thinks his poetry is not that great so he doesnt care if they steal it.\n\nIf only 1-2 people say his poetry is good thst is ok with him because he gets his kicks in other things.\n\nIf he has an idea at the middle of a conversation he doesnt stop. He allows the idea to get lost becaue his priority at this moment is talking to someone. He doesnt take his writing seriously but he is fortnunate that other people do.\n\nHe now is a writing coach.\n\nEssay Then They Were Gone by Rofel Brion (personal essay)\n\nRofel's boundary is he doesnt divulge things that people will get hurt with.\n\n2 schools of thought in nonfiction writing\n1. Be truthful dont add.\n2. Add. Embelish.\n\nMemory is faulty it isnt perfect. So its ok to add anyway.\n\nEvery time he writes he just assumes that it will be read by people and so he has to be careful.\n\nThe question is why would people care about your life anyway?\n\nI also believe that there are all sorts of readers. Some readers might not be interested but some readers might be. So for me, bottom line is, if I think that what I'm writing is worth writing about, whether it is only for me or a few people, then I will write it.\n\nIf he wants to publish, the editors will do the decision. His only vanity publication is Facebook.His only vanity publication is Facebook. He used to have a blog but forgot his password. You get feedback even in Facebook.\n\nHe doesn't take his writing seriously so if he gets bad feedback, he doesn't get really hurt that much.\n\nThe opinions that matter are those that help you improve your writing.\n\nHowever, he is also lazy to revise.\n\n## On education\n\nHe never thought he wanted to be a teacher. Always intimidated by an audience.\n\nHe love to teach because of his love for relationships with students.\n\nHe wants to teach because he want to be noticed. This is a human need.\n\nHe can live without people around him. He is happy with just zoom calls.\n\nConsider yourselves as students all your lives.\n\n## His favorite failure\n\nHis inability to swift out of Economics.\n\nHe lived a very privileged life. No heartbreaks no failures. His cousin said he wont be a good poet.\n\nBut he feels blessed. No moment of depression during the pandemic.\n\nHe only takes things as they come. Focus on the moment. Never aims high. So not a lot of failure.\n\nLesson: Focus on the moment.\n\nNothing disturbs you.\nAll things are passing.\nGod is enough.\n\nHow will he teach? He sleeps and in the morning it just comes to him. Like poetry.\n\n## Biographical info on Rofel Brion\n\nRofel is a poet and a formidable Filipino teacher.\n\n1983, Filipino faculty at the Ateneo Junior Summer Seminar\n\n1987, facilitator at the Creative Writing Workshop\n\nHad an office and room at Cervini dorms\n\nModerator for the Humanities Club\n\nChairman of the I.S. department\n\nWent to the United States to pursue writing fellowships under the Fullbright program\n\nVisited Ann Arbor, Michigan, Bowling Green, Ohio, Manhattan, and tri-state area\n\n## Rofel Brion's writing\n\nHe believes that \"everone can write.\"\n\n[[Translation by collaboration]]\n\nRofel is fluent in English but he has a lack of ease in it at least in his poems.\n\n\u003eI prefer his poems in Filipino to his poems in English. I take pleaasure in the sound of his words. I love the rhythm of the language and the simplest images they evoke. There is all of nature: flower, tree, rock, mountain, sunbeam, and then there are the people—father, mother, family, friend, God. Rofel's poems have a purity—even bareness—that almost makes them \"un-poetry.\" They are without affection, without overtly poetic language, and yet intensely personal, often lyrical. His words are solid and heavy in the hand or light to the touch, or salty or sweet on the tongue, and yet also, always, basic and elemental... like water, like earth, like air. The poems are deceptively complex in their simplicity.\n\n\u003eI see his great love for single, singular images and his special affection for certain Tagalog words—*inaakit, tahimik, busilak*.* I feel his steadfast, integral faith, his deep and overwhelming capacity for friendship but also for love. I also sense her loneliness.\n\n### The audience and themes of Rofel's writings\n\n\u003eHis poems are signposts to the kindred, little notes to other friends, to beloved family members, musings and reflections on the spirit and also, quite naturally, prayers.\n\n[[Topics in the poems of Rofel Brion]]\n\n# References\n\nChan, K.

The same spot every day, the same posture, the same pace. There may be better spots—sunnier, quieter, frequented by birds that can be hunted when the cat is rested and restored. But there is no guarantee, and the search will be never-ending, and there may rarely be time to sleep after all that searching and finding.\n\nIt occurs to me that perhaps the cat is a monk. By this I do not mean anything austere. I doubt anyone in single minded pursuit of enlightenment ever finds it. A good monk would be a mild sort of fellow, a bit of a sensualist, capable of compassion for the world, but also for himself. He would know that it is all right not to climb every mountain.\n\nA good monk would know that contentment is easier to attain than happiness, and that it is enough.\"\n\n# References\n\nBond, R. *A book of simple living: Brief notes from the hills*.

This is esp true if you are minimalist in your beliefs and you don't easily trust people or ideas.\n\nWhen you are in search of convergence tools it is important for you to note your insights and then record them and then return to them.

He felt the tension between popularity and [[Freedom]].\n\nThe irony is that one can only truly feel free if one has addressed one's basic needs.

Reframe: 3/4 of all collefe grads don't end up working in a career related to their majors.\n- True happiness comes from designing a life that works for you. Reframe: True happiness comes from designing a life that works for you.\n\n***\n\n## Encore career\n\nAn “encore” career involves work that combines personal meaning, continued income, and social impact.\n\n***\n\n## Design thinking might be the best approach in living life\n\nWhen emotions are involved, design thinking has proved to be the best problem-solving tool.\n\nAesthetics is the ultimate design problem as it involves human emotion.\n\nLife can’t be perfectly planned.\n\nLife is ever-changing. There is no destination to arrive to, only death. There is no question to answer once and for all.\n- This is tightly connected with Andrew J. Brown's idea of a fluid life philosophy built on sand.\n\nWhat people need is a process—a design process—for figuring out what they want, whom they want to grow into, and how to create a life they love.\n\nIt’s never too late to design a life you love.\n\nTo do\n- The best way to write this note is to describe the nature of life first (i.e., no clear goal, cannot be planned)\n\n***\n\n## Designing your life doesn’t involve a clear goal\n\n- Connect here why life doesn't always start with a purpose.\n\nBecause life doesn't have a clear goal or destination (or at least not at first), you use the following approach:\n- brainstorm\n- try \"crazy stuff\"\n- improvise\n- build your way forward until you come up with something that works\n\nDesigners embrace change. They are not attached to a particular outcome, because they are always focused on what will happen next—not what the final result will be.\n\n***\n\n## What a well-designed life looks like\n\nA well-designed life has a look and feel all of its own—a beautiful aesthetic that speaks to you.\n\nA well-designed life is a life that is generative—it is constantly creative, productive, changing, evolving, and there is always the possibility of surprise. It is not repetitive.\n\nA well-designed life is not a life of drudgery. You weren’t put on this earth to work eight hours a day at a job you hate until the time comes to die.\n\n***\n\n## Start with empathy\n\nEvery design started with a problem.\n\n“Don’t start with the problem, start with the people, start with empathy.”\n\n- Start by empathizing by the person using your life: You.\n- Once you have empathize with yourself, brainstorm to create a prototype that you will use to discover what you don't know yet.\n- We allow what we discover to pivot, i.e. to reframe our original point of view and modify or change our prototype.\n\n***\n\n## One life can have many designs\n\nThere isn’t just one solution to your life. There are many designs for your life, all filled with hope for the kind of creative and unfolding reality that makes life worth living into. Your life is not a thing, it’s an experience; the fun comes from designing and enjoying the experience.\n\nThere are many versions of you, and they are all “right.” And life design will help you live into whatever version of you.\n\nTry stuff.\n\n***\n\n## What life design is\n\nLife design is about imagining a life you want, building it, and seeing something that has never existed before emerge.\n\nYou have three goals:\n1. To conceive of and pursue a life and career you really wanted.\n2. To have as few dysfunctional beliefs as possible.\n3. To increase your ability to generate new ideas for your life design.\n\nA well-designed life is a life that makes sense. It’s a life in which who you are, what you believe, and what you do all line up together. When you have a well-designed life and someone asks you, “How’s it going?,” you have an answer. You can tell that person that your life is going well, and you can tell how and why. A well-designed life is a marvelous portfolio of experiences, of adventures, of failures that taught you important lessons, of hardships that made you stronger and helped you know yourself better, and of achievements and satisfactions. It’s worth emphasizing that failures and hardships are a part of every life, even the well-designed ones.\n\n***\n\n## Build a team that will support you in your life design\n\nGet a design team. Read the book together. Do the exercises together. Collaborate to support one another in designing your lives.\n\nThe different backgrounds in your group assures that you generate truly unique solutions.\n\n***\n\n## Have a bias to action\n\nBefore you can do life design, you need to learn to think like a designer.\n\nDesigners don’t think their way forward. Designers build their way forward.\n\nyou are not just going to be dreaming up a lot of fun fantasies that have no relationship to the real world—or the real you. You are going to build things (we call them prototypes), try stuff, and have a lot of fun in the process.\n\n***\n\n## Build the mindsets of a designer\n\nThe five mind-sets you are going to learn in order to design your life are curiosity, bias to action, reframing, awareness, and radical collaboration. These are your design tools, and with them you can build anything, including a life you love.\n\n- **Curiosity.** Curiosity makes everything new. It invites exploration. It makes everything play. Most of all, curiosity is going to help you “get good at being lucky.” It’s the reason some people see opportunities everywhere.\n- **Bias to action.** When you have a bias to action, you are committed to building your way forward. Create prototypes to try things and use the results of those trials to solve or reframe the original problem.\n- **Reframing.** Reframing is essential to finding the right problems and the right solutions. Learn to step back, examine your biases, and open new solutions.\n- **Awareness.** Learn to let go of the first idea or of a good but not great solution. Learn to see designs from the mess. Let go of the end goal of life and focus on the process—on what is next.\n- **Radical collaboration.** Many of the best ideas about how to live your life will come from other people. Know how to ask and identify the right questions to ask.\n\n***\n\n## Passion comes after mastery\n\nonly one in five young people between twelve and twenty-six have a clear vision of where they want to go, what they want to accomplish in life, and why.\n\n80 percent of people of all ages don’t really know what they are passionate about.\n\nDeveloping a passion takes time. Passion comes after trying something, realizing one wants it, and developing a mastery of it.\n\nPassion is a result of a good life design, not the cause.\n\n***\n\n## There is no one passion that rules them all\n\nMost people do not have that one thing they are passionate about—that singular motivator that drives all of their life decisions and infuses every waking moment with a sense of purpose and meaning.\n\nIn truth, most people are passionate about many different things, and the only way to know what they want to do is to prototype some potential lives, try them out, and see what really resonates with them. We are serious about this: you don’t need to know your passion in order to design a life you love. Once you know how to prototype your way forward, you are on the path to discovering the things you truly love, passion or not.\n\n***\n\n## Engaging in life design increases your luck\n\nWe can assure you that at times it will take you out of your comfort zone.\n\nWhat happens when you engage in life design? Actually, something quite extraordinary happens. Things you want start to show up in your life. You start to hear of job openings you were dreaming about. People you were interested in meeting just happen to be in town. What is happening here? For starters, it’s that “getting good at being lucky” thing we mentioned earlier, a result of curiosity and awareness, and a by-product of using the five mind-sets. In addition, the process of discovering who you are and what you want has a rather extraordinary effect on your life. There will be effort and action involved, no doubt, but it will seem, rather surprisingly, as if everyone is conspiring to help you. And, by being aware of the process, you will have a lot of fun along the way.\n\n***\n\n## Unsorted\n\nThe reframe for the question “What do you want to be when you grow up?” is this: “Who or what do you want to grow into?”\n\n# References\n\nBurnett, B., \u0026 Evans, D.

    "title": "A Better Definition of Financial Freedom",
    "content": "![Freedom](freedom.jpg)\n\nMy argument is that financial freedom, if its definition is put through the scrutiny of philosophical analysis, will become something that is achievable today⁠—not on years ahead.\n\nFinancial freedom is a state.\n\nA state is the condition of X at any given time. This follows that X could have different states at any given time.\n\nA human being, at any given time, is at a particular state. This state can be described as having two parts: one external, one internal. His external state is the condition of his physical body. To understand financial freedom better, we can also extend this external state to include the condition of material things around him. On the other hand, his internal state is his mental state⁠—what goes on inside his mind at any given moment.\n\nWe can think of financial freedom as an overarching idea that our mind constructs to make sense of this combination of internal and external states. _**Financial freedom is simply a state where and when a human being could take any action without the purpose of making money.**_ This means that action, no matter what its nature, when done for a purpose other than to make money can be said as taking place in a state of financial freedom.\n\nThere is a similarity between the states of one person drawing a picture without any intention of selling it because his financial needs are already being taken cared of by his investments (Person A) and the state of a similar artist drawing a picture without any intention of selling it because he has time to spare outside of working hours (Person B). Their only difference is the amount of freedom each has or, more accurately, the potential duration each person has to stay in a similar state to where they currently are. Person A can stay in a similar state for as long as he wants (i.e. continue to draw his picture) because he doesn't have to go back to work while Person B has to take some form of action that involves money-making in order to survive.\n\nMy point is that financial freedom, as a state, is actually more accessible than we think. What isn't easily accessible is the external conditions that could create more similar states. It is easier to carve a block of time after work to enjoy a non-money-making hobby than to wait for all your investments to work for you so that you can do the same hobby.\n\nWhat are the benefits of thinking of financial freedom this way? For one, the definition helps you really dig deep on what you are really aiming for when you say you want financial freedom. If what you are aiming for is the freedom to engage in a creative endeavor, do you really need to wait years when your investments are already working for you before you start? Or would it be better to remember that you could die any time and that it might be wiser to set aside some time in your days or weeks to start doing something you really care about _now_?\n\nPeople who keep their expenses low so that they work fewer hours have more moments of financial freedom than those who spend a lot and, therefore, work a lot. The former may not have total financial freedom, but they have [[Kasapatan, Pagpapaubaya, at ang Paghahangad ng Kapayapaan|\"enough\"]] financial freedom to do things they actually care about _now_.\n\nArtists don't have to put off their art to focus on making money for themselves first. If they look at financial freedom as a state that can be replicated and inserted at any time of the day, [[Creative Freedom Is All That Matters|they could start what they want to do now]].\n\nClarifying our definitions of things makes us think about them more, shedding light on not very obvious truths and insights. This is why I really love [[A minimum viable worldview|philosophy]]. It just makes me a better human being.",

  "/essays/a-never-ending-walk": {
    "title": "A Never-ending Walk",
    "content": "\nThis is a revised version of [[essays/traversing liminality through walking]] the essay, which landed me a spot at the [[ANWW20]]. The original essay was heavy on citations and theory and included some photos. This one was written for a more general audience. I sent it as an entry for the 2023 Palanca.\n\n***\n\n_So Jehovah's anger blazed against Israel and he made them wander about in the wilderness for 40 years, until all the generation that was doing evil in the eyes of Jehovah came to its end._\n\n~ Numbers 32:13, New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures\n\nMy shoulders tightened as I sensed a slight pain in my sacrum. On my next step, I pulled my backpack’s shoulder straps away from my chest. My back felt my bag's soft and warm cushion, and the pain in my shoulders subsided.\n\nOn my left, two dump trucks moved like tortoises climbing a rock. Behind them, a long line of cars started to form. I didn’t expect this eight-mile stretch from Calauan to San Pablo City to be elevated—one of the many other things I overlooked when preparing for this walk.\n\nThis elevated artery, which reminded me of the Aspiras–Palispis Highway of Benguet, was the most challenging part of the walk. It had almost no shade and sidewalks. The sun was peaking, and it burned my legs and feet—feet that were aching from blisters.\n\nA shadow formed before me as I walked toward a sharp curve: a small tree cast the shadow. After laying my backpack under the shade, I leaned on the tree and grabbed my phone from my right pocket. I looked at the time: it was already 10:37. I couldn’t believe I had been walking for two and a half hours with a backpack that weighed more than ten kilos.\n\nI turned to my right, and that was when I saw it—one of the three summits of Mt. Banahaw, the active complex volcano of Laguna, often associated with the supernatural. It peered behind thick foliage as if watching, even mocking me. It was there when the questions came to me: “Why am I doing this? Why am I walking?”\n\nOn June 9, 2022, I walked over 22 kilometers from my apartment at Los Baños to San Pablo City, Laguna. The walk that took 35,000 steps to complete in more than 5 hours started along the busy Lopez Avenue at Los Baños and traversed 5 kilometers of the Manila South Road, passing by the town of Bay, before turning right toward Calauan for another 5 kilometers. From Calauan, the walk turned into a 10-kilometer hike on a highway with a 630 feet elevation en route to San Pablo City.\n\nThe following morning, I walked an extra 22,000 steps around Sampaloc Lake and visited nearby Bunot Lake. I went home that afternoon by riding a jeep that covered what I had walked for five hours the day before in just around 30 minutes. Riding that jeep home was surreal.\n\nDays after the walk, the questions that came to me while staring at Mt. Banahaw continued to revisit me. Why was I walking? I have walked almost my entire life but never questioned my motivations until the long walk to San Pablo City.\n\nAt first, I struggled to piece together a coherent answer. I was surprised that thinking about my reason for walking reminded me of supposedly unrelated existential issues concerning my past. My journals slowly revealed that walking had become my way to traverse the distance between two identities—that liminal space between my Old Self and my New Self.\n\n## The _Limen_\n\nI first learned about the concept of liminality from the book _Les Rites de Passage_  (1909) by Arnold van Gennep. In that book, he introduced a three-phased structure of rites of passage followed by people from different cultures: separation, transition, and reincorporation. Liminality corresponds with the second phase: transition. For Gennep, the transition was always deliberate and voluntary.\n\nWhen we launch ourselves into liminality, we transcend our former identities. Liminality is likened to death, being in utero, and the wilderness. When separated from our former identities, we enter a vast existential expanse, the _limen_, where our sense of being forsaken becomes even more pronounced. An identity blackhole engulfs us, but we are unaware of it.\n\nI was raised in a family of devout Jehovah’s Witnesses, where the Bible was the central authority from which all behaviors were measured. Everything, from big decisions like when to enter a romantic relationship, when and to whom could we have sex, or whether to go to college or not, to minor decisions like what clothes or hairstyles to wear, was dictated to us by a Governing Body made of nine American men located in Brooklyn, New York—all white except one—who delivered instructions on living through a sophisticated chain of command.\n\nI didn’t fully embrace the faith of my parents until I, despite the discouragement of members of our local congregation in San Jacinto, Pangasinan, and threats of my father’s removal from his pastoral duties, went to college at Baguio City. There, I met other young Jehovah’s Witnesses passionately pursuing religious responsibilities amid college life. They inspired me to look deeper at the faith of my parents and accept it as my own. In three years, I dedicated my life to the faith, ultimately becoming a ministerial servant of the Jehovah’s Witnesses—a young pastor—at 19 while serving in a congregation that catered to the Deaf and Hard of Hearing through sign language.\n\nAt the end of my first semester in the third year, the life ahead of me was crystal clear. I belonged to a tight-knit community. I didn't have to think much about what to believe because everything was spoon-fed. I knew who I was and what I wanted to become: a missionary who would bring the doctrines of the religion into distant places. I found my purpose.\n\nBut all of these began crumbling down on March 11, 2011.\n\n## The Long Cold\n\n05:30 A.M.\n\nThe sound of my phone’s alarm woke me up.\n\nFor a brief moment, I wanted to ignore it and go back to sleep, but I didn’t. I was building a new habit and knew missing two days in a row was terrible. I couldn’t do it yesterday because I slept at Kuya Al and Ate Sarah’s place. She was there too.\n\nI wanted to start caring more for my body, so I had to do this. But I regret not returning to sleep. I should’ve returned.\n\nThere was nothing unusual with this morning. I stood up and switched the lights on, illuminating the windowless room that was pitch dark a second ago. My notebook, the daily devotional, and the Bible all piled together gleamed on top of the Monobloc I used as a table whenever I sat on my bed.\n\nI kept the pants I wore when I slept and just put on my blue sweater. It was one of those sweaters with a zipper that ran only from the neck to the chest. It had no pockets, and it was collared like a polo shirt.\n\nI walked out of the room and closed the door. My sister was still sleeping in the room across the dining table and the vacant space that was supposed to be the living room.\n\nBehind the curtains, tiny white and yellow lights flickered. They were from the fields that grew flowers over the hills of Ambiong, the only lights visible outside aside from the few street lights here and there. The sun won’t show up until about another 30 minutes.\n\nAfter putting on my rubber shoes, I unlocked the wooden door and the steel and screened door behind it. I didn’t know it back then, but those two doors separated me from what will be an entirely different life.\n\nOutside, I felt the air change as I walked the steep _eskinita_ that led to the main road. From afar, I could hear that the main road was empty and silent, except for one or two jeepneys already starting their day. Upon reaching the street, the path began to go downhill. I walked, crossed the road, and stood in front of the opened gate of the enclosed hill called Bayan Park.\n\nI climbed the hill and started jogging. I was alone. The air was still cold. A few weeks from now, Baguio’s temperature will start rising. But today, the cold that filled all our Decembers was still here: it was difficult to break a sweat.\n\nAfter just a few minutes of jogging, I stopped.\n\nI should feel good, but I didn’t.\n\nI started walking.\n\nI can still hear her words. I can still hear my words. I can still feel the pain of realizing how young I was and how vulnerable to the weaknesses of the soul. I wasn’t aware until then that I was in my head the entire time. I knew I should be sad, and I thought I was miserable. But I didn't know then that it wasn't sadness that I was starting to feel.\n\nIt was something more: something that would last for weeks, months, years.\n\nThe only thing I knew then was that it was unusually dark. The sun wasn’t around. It won’t come out until about 30 more minutes. And it was cold. Too cold. The beginning of a long, long cold.\n\n## Leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses\n\nOn March 11, 2011, a couple of weeks before the end of my sixth semester in college, I started developing symptoms of clinical depression. I was forced to file for a leave of absence at my university to rest for an entire year back home in Pangasinan.\n\nRecovering from depression was the most challenging thing I ever went through. I saw a psychiatrist when the symptoms were already at their peak—severe insomnia, severe chronic fatigue, anxiety attacks almost every five minutes, and frequent suicidal ideations. Since I found help late, I also began medication late. Psychiatric meds don’t immediately kick in, so I had to endure the symptoms for another month before finding relief.\n\nWhat happens to a devoutly religious young man who suddenly finds himself in the bottomless pit of depression? First, he asks whether God has forsaken him. Then he turns toward the church he belongs to and questions whether what they tell him about God is even true in the first place.\n\nMonths after pharmacotherapy, my sleeping patterns became normal again. The anxiety attacks stopped, and the suicidal ideations lessened. I was still tired most of the time, and an unrelenting dark cloud followed me wherever I went. But I have found some equilibrium. This equilibrium allowed me to continue questioning the foundations of my religious upbringing, including whether there is a God and if the religion where I belonged was indeed his church. This questioning lasted for months culminating in my decision to leave the Jehovah’s Witnesses in April 2012.\n\nI still remember that afternoon when I made the decision. My father, mother, and sisters were preparing to attend the memorial of Christ’s death, the only religious celebration the Jehovah’s Witnesses observe every year.\n\nI stayed inside my room and refused to come out. When my family had left, I took my pen and notebook, placed them inside my backpack, and rode my bike to a nearby abandoned street. There, I saw a mango tree behind a small _kubo_. I sat under the tree and wrote my heart out in the pages of my journal. I wrote until the sun set it. That evening, I rode my bike home on an empty road illuminated by a full moon.\n\nAt that time, I was following what felt right. Little did I know that leaving a religion and a way of life I spent the first 20 years of my life in would be like wandering in an existential wilderness. Abandoning my faith was abandoning myself, and this launched me right into a messy liminal state, where identities are never yet final, and I was always becoming someone I didn’t yet know.\n\n## A Religious Wilderness\n\nAfter leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses in 2012, I went through a two-year exploration of atheism and humanism. Although I never really connected with the atheist community, I explored its most radical forms. I started by reading books like _Bondage of the Mind_ (2008) by R. D. Gold and _The Bible as History_ (2008) by Werner Keller. These books convinced me to reject that the Bible is the inspired word of God. After this, I began questioning the very existence of a God.\n\nConvinced that the existence of a personal God wasn’t necessary, I continued living my life and discovered that it was possible to be happy and find meaning despite being “godless.” Around this time, I encountered Eastern philosophy. I read the _Bhagavad Gita_, the _Yoga Sutras of Patanjali_, and the _Tao Te Ching_. I listened to New Age gurus, learned yoga, and practiced meditation.\n\nImmersing in Eastern philosophy helped me realize that although the nonexistence of a God appeals to me, I didn’t resonate with the hatred that radical atheists felt towards religion. I understood it wasn’t necessary or possible to eradicate such an ingrained element of human culture. Despite not identifying with organized religion or spiritual groups, I realized I was still profoundly “spiritual.” I sought to answer the deep questions of existence and reality.\n\nIn search of answers, I went around different spiritual traditions. I sat down with a sangha of Zen Buddhists in Baguio City, I meditated with Theravada Buddhists in Marikina, I listened to the talks of an Advaita Vedanta teacher on Facebook, and I spent an entire day with a Dada of Ananda Marga.\n\nI tried hard to find something, anything, that would stick but soon discovered that while I appreciated the experimental nature of Eastern philosophy and spirituality, where I am allowed to be in other groups simultaneously, I was not too fond of the intellectual animosity among many of them and sometimes a complete rejection of the rational.\n\nAfter two years of moving around Eastern spiritual circles, I fell in love with philosophy, which reconnected me to my rational, intellectual self. I read heavily on metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, walking every afternoon to reflect on the things I was learning. The main question I asked in my philosophical studies was, \"How should I live?\" I resolved that if I couldn't find a new religion to belong to, I would build my worldview from the ground up and set my own rules for living.\n\nToday, I accept that I am in a psycho-socio-religious liminal state. Here, I go back and forth between the structure of my Old Self and the anti-structure of my New Self Becoming—that unrefined current identity that hasn’t fully reached reincorporation for it to be called my New Self.\n\nI am not inclined to associate with any organized religion. I still don’t think a personal God is necessary, even if his or her existence won’t surprise me. I may have ceased to care too much about metaphysics altogether. But I am still profoundly spiritual and deeply religious, and my intellectual self counterbalances that. I resonate with the progressive and liberal Free Religion concept of Shin’ichirō Imaoka (1881–1988).\n\nDespite my religious identity (and my identity in general) being in flux for ten years since leaving my childhood religion, I never articulated this clearly. I knew I tended not to commit and was uncertain about many things since leaving the church, but I was unaware that my separation from my Old Self caused this uncertainty. I was in an interstitial identity blackhole but unaware of it.\n\nTo make matters worse, I avoided thinking about my life as a Jehovah’s Witness. I avoided it even in the safe pages of my journals. It was a dark past that needed to be completely buried.\n\nBy enacting my liminality through daily walking, culminating in the long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo City, things began to change.\n\n## Walking Liminality\n\nMy desire to walk is a physical expression—a symptom—of being liminal. Walking is performed liminality. After leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses, I noticed I was growing an affinity with nature, landscapes, and physical spaces. It was as if my subconscious told me, “Since society has forsaken you, perhaps it is in the animate outdoors where you shall find a home.” For a long time, I believed that.\n\nWalking in nature became a way to recuperate from losing friends and family members who will no longer associate with someone who has “grown cold in faith.” I walked because I was largely unsure of where I was going and who I was. And this uncertainty calls for it to be performed, embodied, and enacted. My appreciation for long walks, or short daily walks, reflected this need to perform uncertainty through my body while at the same time hoping that perhaps through it, I could recreate myself.\n\nI return to the photographs I took during all the walks I have undertaken since leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses, and I now see glimpses of what it means to be in limen. I didn’t know it then when I took the photos, but there was a reason why I was attracted to abandoned buildings, decaying objects, and landscapes that evoked uncertainty and limbo.\n\nI read that ethnographers find themselves in a similar liminal state when conducting fieldwork in a foreign culture for the first time. As they attempt to temporarily abandon their own culture and immerse themselves into the culture of their study, ethnographers discover that their participants don’t immediately trust them. Moreover, being stuck with their participants in geographic space heightens the ethnographers' sense of unbelonging. Some ethnographers report breaking free from this liminal state by walking with their participants.\n\nThere is something with walking, this simple tool of mobility, that helps humans traverse liminality. Two of walking’s most critical features are encounter and relationality. When walking, an ethnographer encounters two entities: the participant and the place where they are walking. Before the walk, the ethnographer may have very little in common with the participant. However, as the ethnographer joins the participant in traversing place and experience, a commonality emerges between them. This commonality lays the foundation for deeper connection and, therefore, more honest revelations.\n\nWalking opens the space for informality and honesty between the researcher and the researched. Because walks are informal, they allow moments of experimental encounter. Freed from strict rules of research, both ethnographer and participant speak freely to each other. The freedom walking provides facilitates the negotiation of identities between two contrasting people.\n\nI wonder whether this could explain my unquenchable desire to walk throughout all those years after leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\n## Meeting My Old Self on the Road\n\nWhenever I walk alone, I walk with two people: my Old Self and my New Self Becoming. Walking generates a moment from within the identity threshold where these two meet face-to-face, no matter how short. What often comes from this encounter is honest reflection.\n\nLike an ethnographer, I could use walking to find my Old Self waiting for me on the proverbial road and invite him to walk with me, hoping to build trust with each other enough to unveil the distance that has separated us for years and find ways to walk that distance together.\n\nThis encounter with my Old Self happened on that elevated stretch after leaving Calauan—a geographic threshold between Los Baños and San Pablo City. Of the many questions that walking on that threshold provoked, one that stood out was about my motivations for walking. In hindsight, the very nature of walking—the informality, the freedom, the physicality, and the embodied and deeply reflexive nature of the experience—opened the gates and made me finally confront my Old Self.\n\nBefore the long walk to San Pablo, I avoided revisiting my past as a Jehovah’s Witness. I used to think of those first 20 years of my life as a dark, wasted time, with nothing to contribute to where I am now other than as a reference point to whom I shouldn’t become. However, after the long walk, my journal entries suggested that I was interested in inquiring about how my past could inform my current work.\n\nIn my journal, I began comparing my current life with my past life and was surprised to realize that several elements of my old religious life were better than what I have now. Back then, I was embedded in a community. I worked hands-on with a historically marginalized group (the Deaf) and immediately saw that my work made a difference in other people’s lives. I don’t have these things now, but I want them again. Although I will never achieve the clarity I had about who I was and what I wanted to do, I now see that there are elements in my former life that I want to reintegrate into my current life.\n\nInterestingly, my journal entries began discussing how my Old Self as a religious person still manifests in what I currently do. I started entertaining the idea that my work as a philosophically-inclined writer who walks may still have religious elements even if I categorize myself as an agnostic.\n\nIn my journal entry on August 29, 2022, more than two months after the long walk to San Pablo City, I wrote the following:\n\nToday, I will be trying to understand whether what I am doing is indeed religious. Obviously, it is philosophical, and like Bugbee, I don’t have to articulate it and call it “religion” or even associate myself with the field of religion or religious studies. All I need to know is whether I could find inspiration from this field that I have been practically avoiding since 2012.\n\nWalking is a religious thing. The great walkers I read, namely Henry David Thoreau and Henry Bugbee, all have works that can be described as religious. I use religion in its generous, liberal sense, a commitment to a way of life based on principles, regardless of where those principles come from. In the past, I heavily relied on an organization to dictate those principles. Today, I rely primarily on myself. But both new and old identities share a common desire to be religious, and I would never have realized this had I not walked from Los Baños to San Pablo City.\n\n## What Walking Does to Us\n\nWhat happened there on the walk? What made me talk to my Old Self that I have resisted, ignored, and intentionally distanced from for years? Under a scorching sun, with only an umbrella to protect me, forgetting to put on sunscreen or bring sunglasses, and burdened by the excessive luggage behind my back, an opportunity for irreverent dialogue with my Old Self was opened.\n\nThe physicality of walking prompted my New Self Becoming to loosen its guard, shatter the walls it built around itself, and finally confront what was always its subject of concern but unconsciously or consciously avoided: my Old Self. And what a productive move this was because my Old Self held knowledge of the terrain that my New Self Becoming doesn’t have.\n\nGoing through this process took work. I was frightened to realize that perhaps my New Self Becoming hadn’t yet moved that far away from my Old Self, that this new identity that I thought was new was still ancient, and that what I was trying to walk through metaphorically wasn’t an expanse but, in fact, an interstice.\n\nBut this is what walking does to the Self on the threshold of identities. It reveals commonalities between the past and present. It works as a form of transportation to help the Self traverse the liminal realm that links and separates two opposed identities. Walking allows one to relax and trust. Conversation with oneself is more natural than journaling at a desk, natural breaks are permitted, and visual cues in the environment become prompts for reflection.\n\nWhile walking one afternoon, I noticed a long line of flowers in two colors. At first, I thought they grew from different plants: one flower being a variant of the other. Upon closer inspection, I was surprised that the flowers grew from the same plant, although different in color. I would later learn that these were Umbrella Worts or more commonly known as Four O’clocks, because they opened around that time, coinciding with my afternoon walks.\n\nThis visual drama triggered thoughts on community—one of the things I lost after leaving my childhood religion. As a Jehovah’s Witness, I interacted with individuals who believed the same things I believed in almost daily. This sense of belonging was lost after I left. I have tried hard to find community, but I now accept that being in a liminal space means coming to peace with not being connected to people I share similar beliefs with as easily as before and that differences and learning to navigate them are now my norm.\n\nWalking and noticing Umbrella Worts and how two flowers of different colors could grow from the same plant made me ask whether growing a community despite differences is possible. This insight points me toward reincorporation.\n\n## Perpetual Liminality or A Never-ending Walk\n\nLeaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses was painful. I abandoned a familiar life that gave me a sense of stability for a long time. I abandoned many friends, good people who have done many good things for me and treated me as their real brother. I abandoned my parents, who I know are still hopeful that one day I will return.\n\nI will return. I know I will but in a different way.\n\nI found that the possibility of return, of rebuilding myself, only begins when I recognize that I am in control of my destiny. Abandonment is painful, but it is also the autonomy of existence. Because no one is telling me what I need to do with my life, I have complete freedom to shape who I want to be and how I want to exist. From here lies the key to ending liminality and reaching the third phase of Van Gennep’s rite of passage: reincorporation.\n\nImplicit to the idea of liminality is that it has to end. I, who have lost my community and identity, must find a new community and identity. The correspondence between my Old Self and my New Self Becoming facilitated by the ambulatory inquiry that happens through walking, must now point me towards arriving at that ever-elusive ideal: my New Self.\n\nI have seen recent signs of reincorporation in my life. I walked on Session Road in Baguio City during my first visit in two years after the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, and I remembered how I used to walk the same pavement holding an umbrella under drizzles while wearing a polo shirt, slacks, leather shoes, and a shoulder bag.\n\nI intuit that perhaps my unquenchable desire to walk and study walking came from all those years of walking as a minister of the Jehovah’s Witnesses visiting Deaf after Deaf scattered around the hills of Baguio City and La Trinidad. It may be a subconscious compromise to an activity I could no longer do as part of the religious community I left. Walking reincorporated itself into my new life, my new identity, which until now, I haven’t fully articulated.\n\nBut why should it be articulated? Liminality is not a single flavor. It could be either transitional or perpetual—a social position that persists in ambiguity and expansive in loyalty. In peripatetic language, a perpetual liminal state is a never-ending walk.\n\nThe Unitarian minister Andrew James Brown provided a phrase that allows me to describe what I need now as I traverse the road ahead: “the freedom to be tomorrow what we are not today.” This is walking at its very essence.\n\nAs a metaphor for traversing liminality, walking reminds us that every day is a new walk. What only ends this daily recurring walk is the eventual perishing of the body. As long as it is here, the body, through movement, shall remind us of this perpetual liminality, this constant becoming, and helps us embrace it, traverse it, and perhaps even find ourselves at home en route to nowhere.",

    "title": "A walk to Maahas Road",
    "content": "\nYesterday ([[2023-04-06]]), I had an amazing walk at Maahas Road. It was my first time to walk the road. I remember passing by about a month before the pandemic. [[contacts/rem tanauan]], [[Claire Madarang]], [[Lea Ignacio]], and I (the Balitbitan Kids) just came from a visit to Dr. Irma, the jolly-go-lucky homeopath. I guess it was my birthday. We wanted to try the food at IRRI and so we went there via a tricycle.\n\nWe passed by Maahas Road but it never crossed my mind to walk it until two days ago (or yesterday?) when I noticed the path/road parallel Pili Drive. I wanted to check it out because it seemed to enter the rice farms. And so, I plotted my route. I will start walking at the eskinitas of Batong Malake, exit to Lopez Ave., then walk on the side of the highway until I reach the 7-eleven that would signal me to enter.\n\nI began at Onyx St. then Pulog St. where the road has been newly concretized a few months ago. On the corner of Topaz St., a new basketball court has replaced what I remember was a garden and a garage. I was briefly tempted to walk through it but decided to pass by Garnet St. instead.\n\nAt the end of Garnet St., I noticed how light strikes the side of a long apartment complex. I struggled to capture the building's windows, which looked like two lonely eyes. I continued walking at Mt. Kitanlad St., then Ruby St. There, I saw the light once more, which now strikes a closed storefront of a garita. Then, at the corner of Isarog St., I took a photo of a gate. Few people walked the eskinitas of Batong Malake right now. As expected, perhaps 75 percent of the population has gone home to the province. After the holy week, students at UP will have an extra week for reading break, extending their vacation.\n\nAt Isarog St., I empathize with the sign maker who wrote the large letters on the wall around a house. Perhaps, noticing that the box he drew was too small, he opted to cut words: \"Pakiusap hwag tapunan basura canal.\" This is just my theory, though. Another theory is perhaps, the writer wrote pakiusap then decided to draw the border then realized he drew it too small so he had to cut letters. But the grimmest theory is that all of this was intentional. This is how the maker of this sign knows how to write the words.\n\nI continued walking to Jade St., Taal St., Diamond St., then El Danda St., before exiting at Lopez Ave. At Lopez Ave., several churchgoers are crossing the street to San Antonio de Padua Parish Church. Meanwhile, the street is almost empty. A few tricycle drivers are waiting for passengers outside Robinson's Mall. I checked. Robinson's is open until 7:00 pm, but several stores are closed and very few people are doing their groceries.\n\nAlong the Manila-South Road, passengers are waiting for buses to take them home for the holidays. Across the road, I saw several jeeps filled with passengers. But these were not stations. So I thought the jeeps were hired to take passengers home for the holidays. I took a photo of a colorful door and a walker with a large bag, who walked passed me. Later, I would see him sitting with a few bystanders drinking. Perhaps, he is a local. Was he just walking from work? Or did he came from a far and is only home for the holidays? Perhaps the bus dropped him on Olivarez.\n\nI passed by the railroad. A trolley stood by while another approached it. Across the road are murals of Leni and Kiko, reminder of things fought for and lost about a year ago. But also things that are here and will always be here, like this Itlugan store.\n\n(Enter around here: seed - no place stay the same)\n\nA few motorcycles and a tricycle exited from the road where the 7-eleven stood beside. I entered the road. Looked at my map. Maahas road.\n\nThis road is about cars. Car repair shops abound here and there. There is even a second-hand car seller. As usual, there are no side walks. I treaded carefully and crossed the street to the left so I could see vehicles approaching in front. I was starting to get tired of all the metal works so seeing a woodyard was surprisingly pleasurable. And hey, the dance school!\n\nOne of the things I've experienced several times in walking especially during long walks is that people do the same things almost simultaneously at different parts of a place or at different places. I see patterns in people's behaviors and somehow this makes me feel how people really are connected.\n\nIn two different compounds a but far from each other on Maahas Road, two different families—groups of children—were doing the same thing: playing soaked in their inflatable pools.\n\nAt the end of Maahas Road is IPB Road, the road that separates IRRI from the rest of UPLB. Parallel the IPB Road is a railroad. Around 7:00 pm, you will hear the train approaching. This afternoon, there might not be a train coming. It's Maundy Thursday. When there is no train, the tracks are filled with people and trolleys, which reminded me of Lopez, Quezon (cf. [[Lilim 31 - Walking Lopez, Quezon Part I The Rules of Trolleys]]).\n\nI peek inside the fences of IRRI and see the mountains from afar. I crossed the road to where a few joggers and walkers are resting. A dog approached a woman at her seat, its owner following behind it. The shitzu had no leash. It was free.\n\nThe woman left with her husband on a motorcycle. The dog and its owner, a man was left there on the seat. The owner sat and checked his phone, while the dog walked freely away from him. Cars and motorcycles were moving continuously jus a few meters away. Noticing that the dog has walked too far, the man reached for a blue toy in his bag and pressed it making a sound. The dog ignored it at first but his master was persistent. \"Come here or I'll put you on a leash!\" I heard him say. The dog eventually came back. The master picked him up and put him on his lap while he continued swiping his phone. \"No, stay put!\" I heard him say as I jumped over the concrete barrier where we all sat to continue my walk to the dirt road.\n\n## To do\n- Create a location note for Maahas Road",

    "title": "Navigating Spiritual Ambiguity",
    "content": "\nOne of my friends asked me after reading my essay [[essays/traversing liminality through walking|Traversing Liminality Through Walking]] how I navigated myself out of spiritual ambiguity. Honestly, I don't think I have come out of ambiguity, but there are a couple of things that helped me navigate uncertainty in this area of my life.\n\nThe first was discovering the power of [[thoughts/presence is the foundation|presence]] and [[thoughts/meditation|meditation]]. These two things made me aware of what happens between my ears. They helped me realize that what I think is out of my control but it is what I pay attention to that I can control. Meditation gave me the tool to distance myself from my thoughts and, therefore, find peace. From this silence comes contemplation and all sorts of possibilities. I discovered that the more I stayed in the present moment, the less pain I feel.\n\nThe second thing that helped me navigate uncertainty was falling in love with [[thoughts/philosophy|philosophy]]. [[thoughts/purpose|Purpose]] is a big thing to me. Because I was suicidal. And when we are suicidal, it is purpose that saves us. Now, although I have a love-hate relationship with [[thoughts/metaphysics|metaphysics]] because it fosters hatred among people, it was seminal in finding a way out of despair.\n\nI was constantly asking myself, what is my purpose? Or more specifically, what is the reason for me not to kill myself? Now, for many, the existence of [[thoughts/god|God]] is necessary to answer the question. I empathize with them. It is a popular and easy option, which is also logical. But it also means that there is a predetermined purpose for me.\n\nThe alternative, I discovered, is existentialism, which might seem bleak at first: [[thoughts/life is inherently meaningless|life is inherently meaningless]]. Meaning does not arise from outside of us but inside of us. There is no large purpose behind the universe but that is okay. [[thoughts/meaningful living is possible despite meaninglessness|Meaningful living is possible despite meaninglessness]]. We can get by with the little meaning we are capable of creating. We can get going.\n\nI could've killed myself in 2011 when the depression was really bad. But if I did that I may not have met the people I hold dear now and traveled all those places and experienced all those experiences. So looking back if the depression happens again and I am suicidal, I don't have to believe in God to continue going, I just have to remember that this life is so short anyway and I'll be gone soon but there's so much I want to do to make it meaningful and giving up now is a waste.\n\nThis is were [[thoughts/art|art]], specifically [[thoughts/writing|writing]], enters. For me, the arts is here to convince me not to kill myself. I can't kill myself now because there is so much more beauty to see and create. This keeps me going. Aside from this, [[thoughts/relationship|relationships]] are big too. Life is so much easier surrounded by good people.",

    "content": "\nPeople were still walking around the gallery when we began sitting down on a circle of chairs. I started the workshop by asking them to introduce themselves and describe their most favorite walk route. I introduced myself and told them about the road I used to visit almost every afternoon back in Pangasinan. The road that will later be named Snake Road.\n\nI told them how I felt like I owned the road in the past, how I would lie down on the side looking at the stars after farmers have gone home—farmers I personally know. I told them how I left Pangasinan a couple of months after it was cemented—after motorcycle riders, Tiktokers, vendors, and teenagers began flocking every afternoon on what was once my favorite walk route.\n\nI passed the baton to the person on my right and listened to participant stories of their favorite routes. Lea said that her favorite walking route might just be the route we are walking this afternoon. Benjie said that the academic oval at UP Diliman is his favorite walking route. Maui mentioned the place he grew up in at Quezon City. Abbey said Sampaloc Lake. Kuya Icktoy said he likes walking at the beach. Uwa said he's favorite walking route is life itself—a walk where he encounters many people whom he could show kindness to. Bien mentioned Roxas Boulevard, where one could walk along Manila Bay. And Cha, mentioned a farm she stayed in at Puerto Princesa, Palawan.\n\nAfter the introductions, I told them that the walk we are performing this afternoon is more about attention than it is about walking. Walking will simply be a tool to train attention. I told them that attention is life a gift that we offer to someone. The more we offer it and the higher the quality we offer, the more chance of building relationship. Love and friendship grows from the mulch of attention.\n\nI then told them that this afternoon's walk will offer attention to three receivers: Kapuwa (Other), Pook (Place), and Sarili (Self). How will we do it? We would divide the walk into three parts. On the first leg (the walk towards), we would focus on Kapwa. The second leg (the rest), we would focus on Pook. Lastly, on the last leg, we would focus on Sarili.\n\nThe walk would be a practice of being here in the present moment. Instead of using the breath as anchor for attention, we would use kapuwa, pook, and sarili consecutively. After this introduction, I asked everyone to join me outdoors to start the first leg of the walk.\n\n# Nasa Kapuwa ang Ili: Home is in the Other\n\nI divided the group into pairs. Then I read the poem \"Sabay Tayo\" by Inggo. Then we started walking.\n\nWe started the walk outside Sining Makiling Gallery and continued to Freedom Park before turning left to Pili Drive and entering an interior dirt road that was near Molawin Creek.\n\nNearly after the walk started, I received my first feedback from Benjie, \"Take it slow, Vince. Tatay Icktoy is with us.\" I looked back at the 75-year-old man who decided to do the walk with us.\n\n\"Ok, I will. Or I will wait for you,\" I said. Marky saw us from afar and ran toward us. \"I will join the walk,\" he said. He was playing volleyball with some friends. \"Why did you left your friends?\" I asked him. \"It is you I want to be with,\" he answered.\n\nBefore the walk started, I shared a few reminders. I reminded everyone that discomfort is inherent in any walk and that we would be treating it as part of our training this afternoon. I also told them that despite us having a plan, I am open to making changes if the present moment asks so. Marky suddenly joining us is the first change. I thought I would be walking the first leg alone. But there I was doing exactly what the first leg was designed to do: connect with Kapuwa.\n\nOn the corner of Freedom Park and Pili Drive, Hogar, another LB friend saw us from his bike and decided to join the walk. Not being briefed about the design of the walk, he started talking with everyone. I let it be. This exactly is what supposed to happen.\n\n# Nasa Pook ang Ili: Home is in Place\n\nWe entered the interior. I heard Abbey say, \"Uwa and I rode our bikes until the end of this concrete. We turned back.\"\n\nAnd now we're walking the rest of the road. And I know Uwa and Abbey will like what they will see very much.",

    "title": "Traversing Liminality Through Walking: An Autoethnography",
    "content": "\n## Abstract\n\nUsing a five-hour walk from Los Baños to San Pablo City, Laguna, as a springboard, this autoethnographic essay explores how I used the embodied, emplaced, and social act of walking as a means to traverse a psycho-socio-religious liminality. This essay reflects on my personal experience as an ex-ministerial servant (young pastor) of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, who left the religion after a personal crisis in 2012 and have spent ten years in an almost unconscious liminal state, characterized by exploring different belief systems and shifting between the yearning for the structure of my Old Self and the anti-structure of my New Self Becoming. Walking was a symptom of liminality and a way to perform this unconscious liminal state, which was only made conscious after the physicality of the long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo City provoked me to inquire about my motivations for walking. Through reviewing journal entries I wrote after the long walk and reflecting on photographs I have taken in recent years, I conclude that the knowledge generated through walking and ambulatory inquiry could open correspondence between my previous identity and the new identity I am forming, providing the possibility of leaving the _limen_ or, perhaps, finding a new home within it.\n\nMy shoulders tightened as I sensed a slight pain in my sacrum. As I took another step, I grabbed both of my backpack's shoulder straps to pull them forward away from my chest. As I did this, I felt my bag’s soft but warm cushion on my back, and the pain in my shoulders subsided. On my left, two dump trucks moved like tortoises climbing a rock. Behind them, a long line of cars started to form. I did not expect this eight-mile stretch from Calauan to San Pablo City to be elevated—one of the many other things I miscalculated in this walk. This elevated artery, which reminded me of the Aspiras–Palispis Highway of Benguet, was the most challenging part of the walk, mainly because it had almost no shade and sidewalks. The sun was peaking, and it burned my legs and feet—feet that were in pain from blisters.\n\nA shadow formed before me as I continued walking toward a sharp curve. A small tree cast the shadow. After laying my backpack on the ground under the shade, I rested the left side of my body on the tree and grabbed my phone from my right pocket. I looked at the time. It was already 10:37 in the morning. I cannot believe I have been walking for two and a half hours with a backpack that probably weighed more than ten kilos. I turned to my right, and that was when I saw it—one of the three summits of Mt. Banahaw, the active complex volcano of Laguna, often associated with the supernatural. Mt. Banahaw peered behind thick foliage as if watching, even mocking me for the fool I made myself become. It was there when the questions came to me: “Why am I doing this? Why am I walking?”\n\nOn June 9, 2022, I walked over 22 kilometers from my apartment at Los Baños to San Pablo City, Laguna. The walk that took 35,000 steps to complete in more than 5 hours started along the busy Lopez Avenue at Los Baños and traversed 5 kilometers of the Manila South Road, passing by the town of Bay, before turning right toward Calauan for another 5 kilometers. From Calauan, the walk turned into a 10-kilometer hike on a highway with a 630 feet elevation en route to San Pablo City. The following morning, I walked an extra 22,000 steps around Sampaloc Lake and visited nearby Bunot Lake. I went home that afternoon by riding a jeep that covered what I had walked for five hours the day before in just around 30 minutes—a surreal experience.\n\nDays after the walk, I continued to revisit the questions that came to me while staring at Mt. Banahaw. Why was I walking? I have walked almost my entire life but never questioned my motivations until the long walk to San Pablo. At first, I struggled to piece together a coherent answer. I was surprised that thinking about my reason for walking directed me to supposedly unrelated existential issues concerning my past and current identities. After reviewing my journal entries, it became clear that walking has become my way to traverse the distance between identities—that liminal space between what I like to call my Old Self and my New Self and finally come face-to-face with my New Self Becoming.[[1]](#_ftn1)\n\n## A Liminal Wilderness\n\nThe concept of liminality emerged during the 20th century through works written in three disciplines: ethnography, architecture, and cultural anthropology. In all these disciplines, liminality was defined as an in-between state. Arnold van Gennep first used the word in the book _Les Rites de Passage_ (1909) to describe the second phase of a three-phased structure of rites: separation, transition, and reincorporation. For Gennep, the transition was always deliberate and voluntary. An individual launches themself into a disoriented state of liminality to transcend their former identity. In the 1950s, the concept entered architecture through the work of Aldo van Eyck, who expressed human transcience through the geometry of circles and rectangles. The architecture of liminal spaces sought to combine being in space and being in time as individuals interact with geometrical parameters (Al Shrbaji 75).\n\nThe cultural anthropologist Victor Turner reintroduced liminality to anthropology in the 1960s, focusing on its psychosocial nature. For Turner, liminality is subjectively experienced and expressed by an individual. He likened it to death, being in utero, and the wilderness (Turner “Liminality and Communitas” 95). He described it as “a realm that has few or none of the attributes of the past or coming state” (Turner “Betwixt and Between” 47). Separation from one’s old identity launches one into a vast existential expanse, the _limen_, where one’s existential “thrownness” (Dahistrom 12) becomes even more pronounced. Such experiences of being “neither here nor there” (Turner “Liminality and Communitas” 94) slowly engulf us into an identity blackhole where we forget that we are inside one.\n\nI was raised in a family of devout Jehovah’s Witnesses, where the Bible was the central authority from which all behaviors were measured. Everything, from big decisions like when to enter a romantic relationship, when to engage in sexual activities, or whether to go to college or not, to more minor decisions like what clothes or hairstyles to wear, was dictated to us by a Governing Body made of nine American men located in Brooklyn, New York—all white except one—who delivered instructions on living through a sophisticated chain of command. I did not fully embrace the faith of my parents until I—despite the discouragement of members of our local congregation in San Jacinto, Pangasinan, and threats of my father’s removal from his elder duties—went to college at Baguio City, where I met other Jehovah’s Witnesses who were passionately pursuing religious responsibilities amid college life. In three years, I dedicated almost every waking hour of my life to the faith, ultimately becoming a ministerial servant—a young pastor—at 19 while serving in a congregation that catered to the Deaf and Hard of Hearing through sign language. I remember being at the end of my first semester in the third year, feeling intensely that the life ahead of me was so clear. I belonged to a tight-knit community. I did not have to think much about what to believe because everything was spoon-fed to me, and I knew who I was and what I wanted to become: a missionary, bringing the doctrines of the religion into distant places.\n\nAll of these began crumbling down on March 11, 2011, when I started developing symptoms of clinical depression. I was forced to file for a leave of absence at my university to spend an entire year back home recovering. Recovering from depression was the most challenging thing I ever went through. I saw a psychiatrist when the symptoms were already at their peak—insomnia, severe chronic fatigue, anxiety attacks almost every five minutes, and suicidal ideations—so I began medication late. To make matters worse, the meds did not immediately kick in. I had to endure the symptoms for over a month before finding relief. What happens to a devoutly religious young man in such circumstances is that he starts to question whether God has forsaken him. Then this thought leads to questioning whether what the community he belongs to tells him about God is correct.\n\nAfter finding equilibrium, I began questioning the foundations of my upbringing, including whether there is a God and if the religion where I belonged was indeed his church. This questioning culminated in my decision to leave my childhood religion in April 2012. At that time, I was following what felt right. Little did I know that leaving a religion and a way of life I spent the first 20 years was like death or being in an existential wilderness. Abandoning my religion was abandoning my Old Self, which launched me right into a messy psycho-socio-religious liminal state, where identities are never yet final, and I was always becoming someone I did not yet know who.\n\nThe state of liminality is characterized by flux, a state where identity shapeshifts, and nothing is final (Turner “Liminality and Communitas” 94–95). Individuals in a state of liminality tend to be more open to multiple ideas and meanings as they attempt to recreate themselves (Stenner 209). A period of liminality is filled with uncertainty (Stenner 239) and, in my experience, difficulty committing to almost anything. After leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses in 2012, I went through a two-year exploration of atheism. Although I never really connected with the atheist community, I explored its most radical forms. I started by reading books like _Bondage of the Mind_ (2008) by R. D. Gold and _The Bible as History_ (2008) by Werner Keller, which convinced me to reject that the Bible is the inspired word of God. Then I started questioning the very existence of a God.\n\nHowever, after a few years of reading about atheism and humanism, I encountered Eastern philosophy. I read the _Bhagavad Gita_, the _Yoga Sutras of Patanjali_, and the _Tao Te Ching_. I listened to New Age gurus, learned yoga, and practiced meditation. At this time, I realized that I did not resonate well with angry radical atheists who wanted to eradicate religion. Despite not identifying with organized religion or spiritual groups, I realized I was still profoundly “spiritual.” I went around different spiritual circles: Zen Buddhism, Theravada Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta, and Hinduism, finding something, anything, that would stick. While I appreciate the experimental nature of being in these spiritual circles, where I am allowed to be in other groups simultaneously, I also encountered intellectual animosity among many of them and sometimes a complete rejection of the rational. After two years around spiritual circles, I fell in love with philosophy, which reconnected me to my rational, intellectual self. Today, I accept that I am in some psycho-socio-religious liminal state. Here, I go back and forth between the structure of my Old Self and the anti-structure of my New Self Becoming (Stenner 266). I do not desire to associate with any organized religion or beliefs. I still do not think a personal God is necessary, even if his or her existence will not surprise me. I may have ceased to care too much about metaphysics altogether. However, I am still profoundly spiritual and deeply religious, and my intellectual self counterbalances that. Currently, I resonate with the progressive and liberal Free Religion concept of Shin’ichirō Imaoka (1881–1988).\n\nDespite my religious identity (and my identity in general) being in flux for ten years since leaving my childhood religion, I never articulated this clearly. I knew I tended not to commit and was uncertain about many things since leaving the church, but I was unaware that this uncertainty was caused by separating myself from my Old Self. I was in an interstitial identity blackhole but did not know I was in one. To make matters worse, I avoided thinking about my life as a Jehovah’s Witness. I avoided it even when writing in the safe blank pages of my journals. It was a dark past that needed to be completely buried. By enacting my psycho-socio-religious liminality through daily walking, culminating in the long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo, things began to change.\n\n## Walking Liminality\n\nMy desire to walk is a physical expression—a symptom—of liminality. Walking is performed liminality (Stenner 257). One notices this in the works of walking writers like Craig Mod, who has connected his desire to walk Japan with his background as an adopted child and a foreigner in a country far from home. In issue 55 of his popular newsletter _Ridgeline_, Mod wrote, “I am adopted. The sensation of unbelonging—the tenuousness of connection without blood—permeates the life of an adopted person, and so perhaps having lived that allows me to feel a kind of comfort in the distance of life here” (“The Rigor of Process”). In issue 86, Mod continued, “Adopted, Japan based some twenty+ years, torn from a blue-collar shell east of Hartford. Drunkenly walked Tokyo at night in my teens and twenties, and now soberly walk the countryside of Japan in my thirties. Walks have come to define my days and years, are now a durable “platform.” Using them to deconstruct the human geography and history of Japan...” (“Summer Walks”).\n\nMod’s attraction to mobility also coincides with his attraction to material culture, specifically architecture, photography, and food (“Kissa by Kissa” 20). As if abandoned by society, people in liminal states cling to the material world for refuge. After leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses, I have always felt called by nature, landscapes, and physical spaces. It was as if my subconscious was telling me, “You do not belong to any social circle. Perhaps it is in the animate outdoors where you truly belong.” For a long time, I actually may have believed that.\n\nWalking in nature became a way to recuperate from losing friends and family members who will no longer associate with someone who has “grown cold in faith.” I walked because I was largely unsure of where I was going and who I was. Moreover, this uncertainty calls for it to be performed, embodied, and enacted. My appreciation for long walks, or short daily walks, reflected this need to perform uncertainty through my body (Yi’En 212) while at the same time hoping that perhaps through it, I could recreate myself.\n\nIf documentation through field notes and photography could capture our experience of liminality when looking at dereliction in geographic space, say, in abandoned urban spaces (Al Shrbaji 74), then perhaps, documentation too can be used to capture liminality as expressed through the field notes and photos we take during a walk. Photography and written or audio notes capture the memory of that specific moment in the threshold. I go back to the photographs I took during all the walks I have undertaken since leaving my childhood religion, and I now see glimpses of what it means to be in limen. I did not know it then when I took the photos, but there was a reason why I was attracted to abandoned buildings, decaying objects, and landscapes that evoke uncertainty and limbo.\n\n![](file:////Users/vinceimbat/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.jpg)\n\nFigure 1.

Abandoned House, UPLB, Laguna, 2023\n\n“Walking carries with it the possibility for the exploration of the liminal” (Hickey et al. 41). There is something with this simple tool of mobility that helps one traverse liminality. Two of the most critical features of walking are encounter and relationality. If we adopt Hickey et al.’s proposal that ethnographies should be “deeply relational encounters” (37), walking must be a quintessential ethnographic method. A model for how walking can be applied in ethnography may be extracted from the book _Street Corner Society_ _(1943)_, where the ethnographer William Foot-Whyte walked with his participants. Foot-Whyte, a pioneer of participant observation, noticed how the geographic space of the slum area he and his participants walked through, along with the meanings and cultural behaviors attached to specific parts of the area, dictated his research progress, i.e., the questions he could ask, the behaviors he could act out, and the identities he could or could not take hold.\n\nWhen walking, an ethnographer encounters two entities: the Other and the place where they are walking (Ingold and Vergunst 5). Before the walk, the ethnographer may have little commonality with the Other. However, as the walk happens and the ethnographer joins the Other in traversing place and experience, i.e., liminality, a commonality emerges between the researcher and the researched. This commonality lays the foundation for deeper connection and, therefore, more honest revelations. Through walking, ethnography becomes what it should always be: a “shared knowing, generated in place, together” (Hickey et al. 40). The knowledge that emerges out of this shared liminality facilitated by walking is characterized by ethnographers who have used walking methodologies as genuine, honest, new, and deeply relational—knowledge that is “necessarily peripatetic” (Hickey et al. 40).\n\nWe could point to several characteristics of walking that make it a perfect ethnographic method. First, walking opens the space for informality and candor between the researcher and the researched. While walking, the researcher and the researched are allowed to be “messy, uncertain, and multivoiced” (Denzin and Lincoln 26), which is not always the case in formal armchair interviews. Second, because walks are informal, they allow moments of “experimental encounter” (Hickey et al. 42). Freed from strict rules of research, both researcher and participant experience parrhesia (speaking freely). Last, and perhaps most importantly, the freedom that walking provides facilitates the negotiation of identities between the researcher and the researched as they traverse the inherently liminal nature of ethnographic research together (Hickey et al. 50). Walking, therefore, is both a tool and metaphor for ethnographic inquiry.\n\n## Walking as Autoethnography\n\nIf walking not only figuratively explains the liminal nature of ethnographic research but also helps an ethnographer traverse this interstitial space, then the benefits of walking are easily transferrable to autoethnography. When applied to an autoethnographic encounter of someone in a psycho-socio-religious liminal state, as I am, walking generates a moment from within that liminal state through a “physiologically mediated propulsion of the body and socially performed action” (Hickey et al. 48) and transforms it into a shared encounter between the Old Self and the New Self Becoming. The idea that the Old Self and the New Self Becoming are sharing this moment in the threshold becomes the very foundation from where more honest reflection could emerge.\n\nIn autoethnography, the researcher is also the participant. You (the ethnographer) research yourself (the participant) whose experiences and entire life reflect your identity, anchored on a social group (Ellis et al.). Autoethnography proposes that digging into your autobiography induces conclusions that could represent what occurs within your social group (Ellis et al.). However, what if, like I am, you are in a psycho-socio-religious liminal state where your identity and social group are undefined and in flux? In this circumstance, walking, through its very nature as a physiological, social, and emplaced act, unveils the liminal space and the distance between the former identity (the Old Self) and the new identity (the New Self Becoming).\n\nThis happened to me on that elevated stretch after leaving Calauan—a geographic threshold between Los Baños and San Pablo. Of the many perplexing questions that walking provoked, one that stood out was what triggered me to inquire about my motivations for walking. In hindsight, it was the very nature of walking—the informality, the freedom, the physicality, and the embodied and “deeply reflexive” nature of the experience (Hickey et al. 37)—that opened the gates and made me finally confront my Old Self. The cognitive and sensorial nature of walking makes it a powerful ethnographic method (Ingold 17). Through this embodied form of mobility (Hickey et al. 37), a correspondence between two entities, the researcher and the researched, within me was opened.\n\nThus, walking not only unveils the liminal space between the Old Self and the New Self but also provides a means to traverse it. Amid a psycho-socio-religious liminal state, an autoethnographer allows the New Self Becoming to confront the Old Self and talk. Before the long walk to San Pablo, I avoided revisiting my past as a Jehovah’s Witness. I used to think of those first 20 years of my life as a dark, wasted time, with nothing to contribute to where I am now other than as a reference point to whom I should not become. However, after the walk, my journal entries suggested that I was interested in inquiring about how my past could inform my current work. In my journal, I began comparing my life now and my life before and was surprised to realize that several elements of my old religious life were better than what I have now. Back then, I was embedded in a community. Back then, I worked hands-on with a historically marginalized community (the Deaf). I immediately saw that my work made a difference in other people’s lives. I do not have these things now, but I want them again. Although I will never achieve the clarity I had about who I was and what I wanted to do, I now see that there are elements in my former life that I want to reintegrate into my current life.\n\nInterestingly, my writings began discussing how my Old Self as a religious person still manifests in what I currently do. I started entertaining the idea that my work may still have religious elements even if I categorize myself as an agnostic. In my journal entry on August 29, 2022, more than two months after the long walk to San Pablo, I wrote:\n\nToday, I will be trying to understand whether what I am doing is indeed religious. Obviously, it is philosophical, and like Bugbee, I don’t have to articulate it and call it “religion” or even associate myself with the field of religion or religious studies. All I need to know is whether I could find inspiration from this field that I have been practically avoiding since 2012.\n\nWalking daily is a religious thing. Moreover, the great walkers I read, namely Henry David Thoreau and Henry Bugbee, all have works that can be described as religious (Marcel 31). I use religion in its generous, liberal sense, which is a commitment to a way of living based on principles regardless of where those principles come from. In my Old Self, I heavily relied on an organization to dictate those principles; in my New Self Becoming, I rely on myself to set my principles. However, both new and old identities share a common desire to be religious, and I would never have realized this had I not walked from Los Baños to San Pablo.\n\nHowever, what happened there on the walk? What made me talk to my Old Self that I have resisted, ignored, and intentionally distanced from for years? Ingold said that walking creates a space for correspondence for everyone participating in the research (“Life of Lines” 15). In my case, my Old Self and my New Self Becoming. Walking does this by “opening an opportunity for more irreverent, open and experimental dialogue” (Hickey et al. 50). Under a scorching sun, with only an umbrella to protect myself, forgetting to put on sunscreen or bring sunglasses, and burdened by the excessive luggage behind my back, what room is there for reverent dialogue? The physicality of walking prompted my New Self Becoming to loosen its guard, shatter the walls it built around itself, and finally confront what was always its research subject but unconsciously or consciously avoided: my Old Self.\n\nWhile walking, my New Self Becoming dropped from the tower it always occupied to join my Old Self below as both researcher and participant. By doing so, my New Self Becoming understood my Old Self better, finally confronting it as a worthy subject of study. And what a productive move this was because my Old Self held knowledge of the terrain that my New Self Becoming did not have (Hickey et al. 50). However, it was frightening to realize that perhaps my New Self Becoming has not yet moved that far away from my Old Self, that this new identity that thought it was novel was actually, still ancient, that what I was trying to walk through metaphorically was not an expanse but, in fact, an interstice.\n\nThis is what walking does to the autoethnographer on the threshold of identities. It reveals commonalities between past and present identities. It works as a form of transportation to help the autoethnographer traverse the “in-between realm, which forms a third place, or threshold, that links as it separates two previously opposed conditions” (Coleman 202). Walking allows one to relax and trust. Conversation with oneself is more natural than journaling at a desk, natural breaks are allowed, and visual cues in the environment become prompts for reflection.\n\nWhile walking one afternoon, I noticed a long line of flowers in two colors. At first, I thought they grew from different plants: one flower being a variant of the other. Upon closer inspection, I was surprised to see that the flowers grow from the same plant, although different in color. I would later learn that these were Umbrella Worts or more commonly known as Four O’clocks, because they open around that time, coinciding with my afternoon walks. This visual drama triggered thoughts on community—one of the things I lost after leaving my childhood religion. As a Jehovah’s Witness, I interacted with individuals who believed the same things I believed in almost daily. This was lost after I left. I have tried hard, even until now, to find community and accept that being in a liminal space such as where I am right now means coming at peace with the fact that I will not be connected to people I share similar beliefs with as easily as before and that differences and learning to navigate differences shall now be my norm. Walking and noticing Umbrella Worts and how two flowers of different colors could grow from the same plant made me ask whether growing a community despite differences is possible. This points me toward reincorporation.\n\n## Perpetual Liminality or A Never-ending Walk\n\nDerrida (1967) said that “deconstruction implies the possibility of rebuilding” (p. xlix). The rebuilding process starts with recognizing that one is in control of one’s destiny. Per Sartre (1946), existentialism and abandonment are related. Whatever its cause, abandonment involves detachment, a liminal condition that could be interpreted as an “autonomy of existence” (Al Shrbaji 76). Because no one is telling me what I need to do with my life, I have complete freedom to shape who I want to be and how I want to exist. From here lies the key to ending liminality and reaching the third phase of Van Gennep’s rite of passage: reincorporation. Implicit to the idea of liminality is that it has to end. I, who have lost community and a sense of identity, must eventually find a new community and identity. The correspondence between my Old Self and my New Self Becoming facilitated by the ambulatory inquiry that happens through walking must now point me towards arriving at that ever-elusive ideal: my New Self.\n\nIndeed, I have seen recent signs of reincorporation in my life. While walking on Session Road in Baguio City during my first visit in two years after the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, I remembered how I used to walk the same pavement holding an umbrella under drizzles while wearing a polo shirt, slacks, leather shoes, and a bag hanging on my shoulder. I intuit that perhaps my unquenchable desire to walk and study walking came from all those years of walking as a minister of the Jehovah’s Witnesses visiting Deaf after Deaf scattered around the hills of Baguio City and La Trinidad. Perhaps, it is a subconscious compromise to an activity I could no longer do as part of the religious community I left. Walking reincorporated itself into my new life, my new identity, which until now, I have not fully articulated.\n\nWhy should it be articulated, however? Liminality is not a single flavor. It could be either transitional or perpetual—a social position that persists in ambiguity and expansive in loyalty (Ybema et al. 24). In peripatetic language, a perpetual psycho-socio-religious state is a never-ending walk. Regarding my religious identity, I like how the Unitarian minister Andrew James Brown put it: perpetual liminars desire “the freedom to be tomorrow what we are not today,” which is precisely what walking signifies. As a metaphor for traversing liminality, walking reminds us that every day is a new walk. What only ends this daily recurring walk is the eventual perishing of the body. As long as it is here, the body, through movement, shall remind us of this perpetual liminality, this constant becoming, and helps us embrace it, traverse it, and perhaps even find ourselves at home en route to nowhere.\n\n## Works Cited\n\nAl Shrbaji, Sarah. “On Walking in Derelict Urban Spaces: Experiencing Liminality in a City.” _A Obra Nasce: Revista de Arquitetura e Urbanismo Da Universidade Fernando Pessoa_, vol. 14, 2020, pp. 73–83.

It sets a strict schedule on one's psychological development, forcing one to make premature work and career decisions, which hamper the organic discovery of one's purpose.

When you make changes, the software remembers the colors of the pixels. In vector, there are no pixels. There are only trajectories that are recalculated. (This explanation still doesn’t make sense. But find a better explanation.)\n\nAll photos are in pixels. They are not calculations. An image is simply a record of colors. All images are edited in an image editing software.\n\nIcons are easier to create and edit as vectors.\n\nWhen you put images and vectors together to design your website, you use screen editing software.\n\nConcepts that repeat themeselve in all softwares\n\nLayers\n\n- An image is made up of different layers, the order of which you can rearrange.\n   - Always name your layers. This is best practice in design.\n\nStyle\n\n- Maintain consistency with a lot of elements, esp. typography.\n- Use a stylesheet.\n\n# Brief History of Web Design\n\nSocial context + technology of the day = design current state\n\n1894 Art Nouveau\n\n- First time when graphic design was used in a large commercial scale\n- Reaction to rigid and academic art\n- maximalist art\n\n1959 Swiss Design/International\n\n- Reaction to chaos of world wars\n- clean, systematic, and clear design\n- rigid and grid\n- minimalistic\n\n1992 David Carson Grunge\n\n- Grunge design\n- Reaction to rigid Swiss design\n- Overlaying text and image\n- Never went to design school\n- Extreme and innovative\n- Readability is not always necessary to communicate; sometimes, messiness communicates your message better\n\nThe state of design reacts to social context and constrained by available tech\n\nIn web design\n\n1991\n\n- Simple html\n- Folders\n- Images\n\n1995\n\n- Experiments on using background colors\n- People were just exploring the web for creativity\n- They didn’t apply graphic design rules\n\n2000s\n\n- People started applying graphic design rules to designing web pages\n- Flash became popular, which allowed animation publishing.\n\n2007\n\n- iPhone was introduced and Apple did not support Flash leading to its decay in 2017\n\n2009\n\n- Zune created a flat design to their website in reaction to everyone trying to make cool interfaces\n- Cleanliness and minimalism\n\n2010s\n\n- Basic guidelines for good design were popularized\n- Mobile responsiveness\n- Many tools now\n- Accessibility\n\nTake history classes (art history and web design history) to be a better designer.\n\n# Intro to Typography\n\nThe font must:\n\n- Deliver information (legibility)\n- Communicate values (aesthetics)\n\nTwo categories\n\n- Serif\n- Sans-serif\n\nThe differences were caused by the tools used in writing. Serif is older because old tools left unecessary marks. San-serif is newer because more precise tools allow us to write cleaner.\n\nOther categories\n\n- Script - handwriting\n\nIf you are communicating something modern, use sans-serif. If you are communicating something more established, use serif.\n\nWhen designing, be mindful about hierarchies. What should readers notice first, second, third, etc.? By manipulating the width and styles of your fonts, you can design a hierarchical structure.\n\n- Bolder more catchy\n- Bigger font more catchy\n\nManipulating the space between fonts can change the feel of the page.\n\n- Tracking - changes spaces between all letters\n- Churning - changes space between two specific letters\n\nChange line height (space between the lines in a paragraph).\n\n- When text is too small, you need more space between the lines so you can read it.\n- However, the gap between the lines shouldn’t be too big that you start to notice the gaps that you start to focus on them more than on the text.\n\nDon’t create very long lines.\n\n- This lessens legibility.\n- People shouldn’t have to tilt their head just to read your work.\n- Tip: Limit each line to at least 10 words.\n\nWhat fonts should you use?\n\n- There are tens of thousands of fonts.\n- If you are a beginner, just start with some classics.\n\n6 fonts to use (by Massimo Vignelli) - not premium fonts\n\n1. Garamond\n2. Bodoni\n3. Century Expanded\n4. Futura\n5. Times New Roman\n6. Helvetica\n\nUse Google fonts\n\nIf you want to explore fonts beyond these 6, google their font alternatives and look for fonts that are similar to them.\n\nWhat size of font will you use?\n\n- Go to typeface.\n- Play around and look for how they look in the website.\n\nHeadings\n\n- You don't need more than 3-4 headings.\n\nPractice. Typography is a crafty skill. You have to manipulate stuff.\n\nExercise\n\n- Go to a dictionary. Pick a word and its description. Then create a poster out of it. Share to social media. Change fonts and layout everyday.\n- Design a daily quote from your favorite author and post it on social media every day.\n\n# Using the right image for your web design\n\n3 steps\n\n1. Choose the right style/genre\n2. Pick the right image\n3. Using it correctly\n\nStyles\n\n- Photography - very realistic\n- Illustrations (handmade or vector) - more abstract, can tell more complex story in one visual\n- 3D - similar to illustrations; combines real-world rendering (combines photography + illustrations)\n\nCollect and categorize types of visuals that you like\n\nChoosing the right image depends on your subject matter and brand.\n\nFor photography, where will you get the images?\n\n1. Create those images yourself or hire someone.\n2. Buy images or get it from stock photos.\n   1. Shutterstock\n   2. Pexels\n\nDevelop a fullstack developer mindset (learn as much as you can so you can just do them yourself).\n\nWhen choosing an image, r where you are going to use it—the context, the text around it.\n\n- Choose a high-quality image.\n- The image must have a layout for itself (subject is clear; there is a space to position text).\n\nCollect inspiration. Familiarize yourself with different styles.\n\n- [Awwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)\n[4651 Landing Page Design Inspiration - Lapa Ninja](https://www.lapa.ninja/)\n\nFind images that work with those designs.\n\n# Intro to Layout\n\nHardest skill to master\n\nLayout must be both beautiful and easy to consume.\n\nWhat makes a good layout?\n\n- Clear, not confusing\n- There is a hierarchy. You know what’s first, second, last.\n- Interesting, not boring\n- Helps user consume content\n\n**In any design, there is an element that is big, medium, and small. These contrasts allow for reorganization.**\n\n- Decide: Which is big, medium, and small?\n\nMost designs can be broken down in this.\n\nGrids\n\n- Invisible line structures.\n- Gives logic.\n- Popularized by the book “Grid systems”\n- 12 grids is popular because you can divide it by many numbers\n- Gutter: space between grids\n   - With text, you don’t want too narrow gutters that make text so close\n   - With images, make them tighter\n- Decide how wide your grid is\n   - Most displays now are really wide. We don’t want to use the entire screen because people will have to scan it all.\n   - Container: is where the grid is contained. Usually at the beginning. The grid does not get wider than the container\n\nExercise\n\n- Do a daily practice.\n- Do three different layouts.\n\n# How to Use Colors in Web Design\n\nSteps\n\n1. Choose a color based on the meaning of it.\n2. Use a pallette generator to find complementary colors.\n3. Find a way to combine the colors together.\n\n**What is the meaning of each color?**\n\nUse colors depending on their color\n\n- Green and Blue: Nature\n- Red = Love\n- Black = Death and mourning (contrast: in East, white)\n\n[Meaning of Colors in Color Psychology](http://www.empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com/meaning-of-colors.html)\n\n**When I need to combine it with something, how much will I need of that color?**\n\nCreate a pallette.\n\n[https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)\n\nYou can also upload your photo and the generator will create the pallettes.\n\n**How do you combine the colors together?**\n\n60:30:10 rule\n\n- 60% primary color\n- 30% secondary color\n- 10% tertiary (accent) color\n\n# Why Hierarchy is So Important in Web Design\n\nHierarchy is important in guiding the eye of the visitor.\n\nHow to create hieararchy\n\n1. Size\n2. Color\n3. Position (you will notice this in pricing sales pages)\n\nHow do you create hierarchy using size?\n\nHow do you create hierarchy using color?\n\nHow do you create hierarchy using position?\n\nGhost button - borderless button\n\n# Using Wireframes in Web Design\n\nWireframes are sketches of the structure of a page.\n\n- How many titles do you need?\n- Where do you put the button?\n- How many images will you use?\n\nBefore you go to your design software, you want to make sure that what you are designing is the right thing.\n\nDoing wireframes helps you focus on\n\n- Structure\n- Content\n\nFocus on the most important thing: your message\n\nSteps\n\n1. Hand-drawing in your notebook\n   1. Always start with this to keep your mind more open.\n2. Convert your drawing into a high fidelity wireframe using software\n   1. This step may not be necessary if you are just working for yourself. You can just jump into creating.\n\nTip: Use real text in your wireframe. Your real copy. Not just lorem ipsum. This will help you really see if your design is working.\n\nUI kits\n\nPlatforma: [http://platforma.ws](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description\u0026redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWxNa1ZmS2xSb0RKRmFCRWpYRXZZci1VOUlWQXxBQ3Jtc0tueWdDRTc1NEdyZGtZSXlpZ2Q1S2NXb3lEbnQxQ01DU2l1akNHa3FkUzRfNjJqVkJydlFVcDM1RnI4QnpaRmMwX0NGYnBFZS11enZLU3RSaXhTaTJSNUtuREhXVFlsNFhtcjVXbkhNNjJyTDhpWUZ3SQ\u0026q=http%3A%2F%2Fplatforma.ws)\n\nInvision Form: [https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-de...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description\u0026redir_token=QUFFLUhqbkE5a0FsTXk4cVRaZWZNV2tEVzJBMXFEVW9Kd3xBQ3Jtc0tsNWl0TTY5d1ROQ0U2UlJMZjQ5WFJBNV9DS2JaVkxPRE5DeDlFak1DZ3NLQmItX1dsVWZDWVYwcHoyLTctQjREWmtCMmVwWU5SM0FFOTVxM3JPTF80VXB6MVVuV0JZdmhwNG9qVXN1R2M5Y1pmbHc5RQ\u0026q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.invisionapp.com%2Finside-design%2Fdesign-resources%2Ffree-wireframe-kit-form%2F)\n\n# Creating a Good Hero for Your Website\n\nThe majority of your visitors will leave in 15 secs.\n\n- They don't understand where they are.\n- This is not for them\n\nQuestions\n\n1. What is this?\n   1. Who are you?\n   2. What is this website I’m visiting?\n2. What do you do?\n   1. Browse content ala Wiki\n   2. What is the purpose of this website?\n3. What’s in it for me?\n   1. Why would I invest time on your website?\n\n# Website Content Structure\n\nSteps\n\n1. Understand the website goals\n   1. Every element in the website must help achieve the goal.\n   2. There will always be a high level goal and minor goals.\n2. Brainstorm all the kinds of content that are going to help us achieve the goals.\n3. Organize the content in a way that makes sense (sitemap).\n- Use cards.\n- Put all brainstormed content in individual cards\n- Arrange them\n\nInformation architecture\n\n- Your arrangement of information creates a unique experience to the visitor.\n- What will be the right structure?\n- How will navigating this site actually feel?\n\n# UX/UI Best Practices for Web Design\n\nNavigation\n\nApple\n\n- Uses a main navigation and subnavigation\n- Then uses sticky menu to keep you track on where you are\n\nBreadcrumbs is a good practice in complicated websites to remind you of structure\n\nPurpose of navigation\n\n1. To show the visitor their options\n2. To show somebody where they are in the website.\n   1. This is important particularly because some people will be visiting the site via an internal link.\n\nButtons\n\nYou want your buttons to be clear about what will happen if they click it. This will prevent them from hesitating to click.\n\nYou want to teach your visitor what does what. Consistency is the key.\n\n- E.g., if blue text is linkable, all blue text must be linkable\n- Peopl are browsing different websites and there are “social” rules like when its in a box, it’s a button or if it’s in blue, it’s a link.\n- Do not design your website in a vaccum. It is part of a larger context.\n- It’s okay to have multiple calls to action. But you have to create a hierarchy within them.\n- You have to make sure that things that are clickable look clickable if you want people to click them.\n\nBe very careful about giving names to pages, buttons, and sections in your website.\n\n- instead of Talahardin, say notes\n\nContrast\n\nChoose correct colors, especially with text. White on white is difficult.\n\nUse overlays to solve contrast problem when photo background does not contrast enough with the text.\n\n# How to Find Web Design Inspiration to Stand Out\n\nTwo steps\n\n1. Look at other websites.\n   1. You want to see what other people in your niche have already done. You want to see what’s working and what’s not. Screenshot them.\n2. Look at designs outside of websites.\n\nYou don’t want to do exactly what other people have done.\n\n**Website inspirations**\n\nCheck website inspirations:\n\n- Awwwards\n- Lapa Ninja\n[{title}](http://blog.gaetanpautler.com/)\n\nLook for typography, color, or layout you want to use.\n\nCollect them in your Invision board.\n\n**Inspirations outside websites**\n\nFilms\n\nBooks\n\nHistory\n\nLook for visual ideas embeded in your search terms or space\n\nThis assures that you are doing something outside of what has already been done.\n\n# Tools to Develop Your Website\n\nOptions\n\n1. Code\n   1. Code the website (ultimate customization)\n2. Abstract\n   1. Wix or Squarespace (no coding needed)\n   2. not built in designers in mind\n   3. tools for dummies (easy)\n   4. things have been abstracted\n   5. codes have been made into components\n   6. lots of templates\n   7. constricts your creativity in design\n   8. what you get is not what you want to do\n3. UI for code\n   1. You use an interface to manipulate the code.\n   2. You are almost using code but not really\n   3. Spectrum\n      1. Webflow\n         1. It is almost like coding yourself but you don’t have to type the codes.\n         2. Steeper learning code.\n         3. You don’t have to write code but you need to think like a developer.\n      2. Elementor\n         1. Wordpress plug-in\n         2. Powerful but not as powerful as webflow\n      3. Editor X\n         1. Built for designers.\n         2. Not as powerful as webflow but not as dummy as Wix.\n\nWhere will you host it and manage content?\n\nCMS\n\n- Allows you to update content without changing the design of the site.\n\n",

Human infants are born with craniums made up of four plates that have not yet knit together into a solid dome so that their heads can compress to fit through the birth canal, so that the brain within can then expand. The seams of these plates are intricate, like fingers interlaced, like the meander of arctic rivers across tundra.\n\nThe skull quadruples in size in the first few years, and if the bones knit together too soon, they restrict the growth of the brain; and if they don't knit at all the brain remains unprotected. Open enough to grow and closed enough to hold together is what a life must also be. We collage ourselves into being, finding the pieces of a worldview and people to love and reasons to live and then integrate them into a whole, a life consistent with its beliefs and desires, at least if we're lucky.\"\n\n# References\n\n[_Recollections of My Nonexistence_](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/n4uwgvze7nuvh85on7wux/z2hghnholond7nip/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNBMGNwTWM=)",

    "content": "\nBefore you being, remember that you don’t have to follow the book’s structure or even its concepts. You can create your own concepts and structures based on your individual mental models.\n\nTo convert [[literature notes]] into [[Evergreens]], do the following:\n\n1. Since writing permanent notes out of literature notes can take a lot of time that you might need to spread out in multiple work sessions, you could start everything in a single digital note first. Title this one note with the title of a book.\n2. Begin to cluster highlights and annotations ([[Fleeting notes]]) you've taken while reading around single big concepts. Think about this process of creating clusters as creating an index for a book. For definitions, collect usage examples in the text and definitions themselves to get a clear picture of the term’s meaning.\n3. Write a title for these clusters as if you are writing note titles ([[How to write good note titles]]). This is helpful because these clusters could become individual notes or structure notes later.\n4. Bold this title.\n5. If there are multiple big concepts, then create multiple big concept titles within the digital note.\n6. When you start clustering annotations, you will notice that there are individual concepts within those clusters. This is specially true if the big concept is a conclusion with many premises. Start writing atomic permanent notes for each of these premises.\n7. Connect these new notes with past notes. [[Fill permanent notes with links to other notes]].\n8. Return to the big concept note. If it doesn’t have its own note yet, you can now separate it from the original note and put it on its own note. Revise it based on what you learn writing the small concept notes. Be as concise as possible when writing.\n9. Repeat the process to other big concepts.\n\nAt the end of a permanent note, include the references you used to write them and include the exact passages that prompted the note under each reference. Do not delete the original aggregation of texts. Keep them under the note bearing the book’s title as reference.\n\n# References\n\nMatuschak, A.

    "title": "iPhone Photo Editing by Sean Dalton",
    "content": "\nEditing on your photo actually makes your editing color accurate because most people consume photos on their phones anyway.\n\nThree parts of a photo\n1. Light - exposure of a photo, dark or light\n2. Color - white balance, colors\n3. Detail - sharpness, grain or noise, overall texture\n\nExercise: Take one photo and edit it in 10 different ways. Then choose which one represents your style better.\n\n.JPG is most common, digitally compressed, smaller file size, more difficult to edit -\u003e best for simple edits\nRAW captures as much data as possible, not compressed (sot takes up a lot of space), greater flexibility in editing, more detail in bright/dark areas (dynamic range) -\u003e for more complicated edits\n\nIf you are a mobile shooter, shoot your photos through the Adobe Lightroom App because it has its own RAW file (dng).\n\n**Exposure and emotion**\n\nExposure has a huge impact on mood.\nDark photos are moody, mysterious (hide info), ominous, scary, powerful, refined, intense, sad, calm, and relaxed.\nLight photos are optimistic, upbeat, happy, airy, ethereal, and gentle.\nLight photos can also be sad like dark photos (via contrast).\n\nContrast is the difference between the dark and bright areas of a photograph.\nPhotos can be high/low contrast regardless of their overall exposure.\n\nA dark image with very low contrast (image is more gray instead of huge difference between light and dark) can be a sad, sombre, or relaxed photo.\n\nA dark image with a high contrast is refined, polished, or intense.\n\nHigh contrast images (regardless of whether light or dark) are dramatic, intense, loud, vibrant, punchy, and sharp.\n\nContrast is one of the most abused functions in the editing process. Avoid using too much contrast.\n\nLow contrast images may not standout that much. They are relaxed but not so bold. They are subdued, gentle, soft, quiet, muted.\n\nGood light doesn't need high contrast to stand out.\n\n**Color and Emotion**\n\nThree aspects of color:\n1. Hue - is the actual color and their shades in between\n2. Saturation - is the purity of the color; the purer the color, the more saturated it is; the less saturated the closer it is to gray\n3. Luminance - the brighter the color, the more luminant it is; less luminant is darker (dark blue vs light blue)\n\nIn the color wheel, the middle is pure white, the edges are the pure hues of color.\n\nColor harmony is color combination that look good together.\n\nGo to color.adobe.com\n- Analogous\n- Monochromatic\n- Triad\n- Complementary\n- Compound (complementary + analogous)\n- Shades\n\nThe base color is the color that is most prominent in your image.\nExplore the colors in other people's photos on the app.\n\nYou can use this app before you go editing just to help you in a subconscious level to know which colors work together.\n\nJohann Wolfgang Van Goethe was one of the first to experiment on color and its effect on emotion.\n- Published *The Theory of Colors*\n\nRed: passionate, aggressive, sexy, intense\nOrange: playful, energetic, exciting\nYellow: happy, friendly, warming, calm, caution\nGreen: natural, prosperous, trusting\nBlue: serene, trustworthy, inviting\nPurple: luxurious, mysterious, romantic\nPink: Young, innocent, calm, feminine\nBrown: natural, earthy, rustic\nBlack: powerful, sophisticated, mysterious, scary\nWhite: clean, virtuous, bright, hopeful\nGray: neutral, sofy, gloomy, moody\n\n**Storytelling and Editing**\n\nThe content tells the story.\n\n**Editing Styles**\n\nRealism - Trying to achieve the most realistic look possible (photojournalists)\nStylized - Editing for aesthetics without regard for realism.\n\nYou can aim to balance the two. Create a stylized photo that is not overly stylized.\n\nStylized: cyan + blue, cyan + pink, green + pink\n\nQuestion: Are you going for more realistic or stylized?\n\nThere is no right and wrong in editing. Editing is an artistic process. Certain ways of editing is right for the majority of people, but it doesn't mean that you are wrong.\n\nDon't worry about creating something that is right or wrong. Worry about creating something that you care about.\n\n**Finding Your Editing Style**\n\nFind inspiration. Search for beautiful things on Pinterest or IG.\n- Analyze color, exposure.\n\nMimic others. Try to achieve the same look or edit.\n- Take a similar photo and edit it similarly.\n\nEdit as often as you can.\n- Edit one photo differently, then ask people what edit they like.\n- Practice editing at wesaturate.com\n\nGreat apps\n- VSCO (A6)\n- Snapseed\n- RNI Films (dust and grain filters)\n- Adobe Photoshop Fix (best in cleaning up skin blemishes)\n\nOrganizing in Lightroom\n- 5* if you like; flag it if you really like\n\nCreate an editing workflow.\n1. Import your photos.\n2. Sort/organize photos.\n3. Prep the photo (cropping, remove blemishes, simple pre-edits)\n\t1. Crop\n\t2. Optics\n4. Edit exposure/light, contrast, higlights, and shadows.\n\t1. You can opt not to use contrast and adjust contrast manually through whites and blacks\n\t2. Ansel Adams said that a photograph must have some areas where totally devoid of detail in the whites and blacks, which creates an aesthetically beautiful contrast.\n5. Edit color. When you edit color, this will affect exposure, so you will go back in forth to the two.\n6. Edit effects or details (vignetting, clarity, sharpening).\n7. Selective edits\n\nYou can only achieve really good photos by editing. A lot of CM's photos were focused well using selective editing.\n\nHow to import photos to lightroom\n- From phone to lightroom\n- From DSLR or mirrorless camera to phone\n\t- Via wifi (Sony A73)\n\t\t- Organize by date\n\t- Adapter SD card to iPhone\n\t- Upload to computer first then collection then sync to lightroom CC\n\nPreset is a saved edit.\nYou can use preset first then just adjust.\n\nCommon editing mistakes\n- Over-editing - To avoid over-editing, edit a photo then step-back, then return later.\n- Not stepping away\n- Not cropping your photo - Cropping helps with composition.\n- Too much contrast and clarity - If you use contrast, use some haze to calm it.\n- Using odd colors - colors that don't go together. To avoid this, check that you white balance is correct before editing.\n\nGreens are distracting if they are too vivid. Desaturate them.\n\nEditing food\n\nFor cafe images add blue by lowering the first period down on the red color curve.\n\nThen go to color mix and lower the saturation of most colors.\n\nYou can also selectively mask the food and add detail or clarity.\n\nExport to RNI Films and add some grain or adjust warmth too.\n\nTo create more focus on a subject in black and white:\n1. Create a radiant filter.\n2. Invert it.\n3. And put down the clarity of everything around that subject.\n\nHow to become a better editor\n- Experiment, edit as many pictures as you can, edit one photo in 10 different ways.\n- Step away, come back, and do it frequently.\n- Learn the color schemes that you like and figure out how to capture those colors through your camera and enhance them during editing.\n- Use presets from photographers you like and implement them.\n- Mimic others.\n\n# References\n",

    "title": "In search of the internment camp in Los Baños",
    "content": "\nAlternative title: Chasing the Ghosts of The Internment Camp\n\nWent to UPLB Library and read about the internment camp at UPLB during the Japanese occupation. It was an amazing read. The historian was a good writer. After reading, by 4 pm when the library closed, I walked around Freedom Park, Madamba, and Viado to trace the interment camp. I wrote my impressions, reflections, and discoveries.\n\nBehind Baker Hall is a submerged area. A broken bamboo bridge makes sense. There definitely is a deep ravine. Part of Molawin creek perhaps. Until now, this ravine exists and plants still grow here although I am not sure whether they are still bamboos and grass here, 6 ft high.  I more bamboos. Just lots of bananas. Large trees. Some palms. In this ravine was also an orchard. This area is what is now the Senior's Social Garden.\n\nFrom where I stand right now, I could easily see the Los Baños internment camp.\n\nThe back of the hall would show that its iron works have really seen years. The cement looks new though. Was this building just restored? Was it completely bombed?\n\nThe wires would be clear from here. The guards. The infirmary. The barracks. Chapels would cover my view, but where they are playing soccer right now would easily be the wide space where the prisoners could play. Up on Baker Hall's second floor, would be the best place to watch all the suffering in the camp. I imagine Konishi standing there looking at the internees, thinking about lessening their rations or rummaging their gardens. The plots would be easily seen from this spot.\n\nAs I seat, nearby, I hear the sound of racket hitting the ball. A man is playing with the fence on the tennis court nearby, owned by the aptly called Baker Tennis Clubhouse. Watching a tennis game wouldn't have been a bad idea. This court may have been where the target range of guards once were.\n\nA walk is a good metaphor for the process one needs to go through in understanding oneself and the larger world where one is embedded in. You don't run. You don't hurry this process. You take all your time. You don't force things. You walk.\n\nWhere this basketball court right now is guard house 1. This unnamed building beside the court could have been the infirmary.\n\nOn this football field, part of Freedom Park, is guard 1, barracks, kitchen. The part where the bleachers are not built could have been a part of the barracks and the kitchen. Past the bleachers on what is now Vraja would be the commander's barracks. Interestingly, this is the portion is in front what it is currently the UP ROTC headquarters, actually bult since 1912. Across the road from here is the entrance to the target range. The ROTC headquarters was part of the target range.\n\nIf my theorizing is right, then the Fertility tree cannot be older than 1945. It is too prominent for it. It to be in the map. Or it is possible that it was already there but way smaller than now so it was easily ignored. That area where it is now is the blank space that divides two chapels or mess halls. Perhaps there is that larger gap because of the tree.\n\nRoxas street where I met Blanca for the first time was maintained. A long time road but it cut through the camp. If thats the case, the better location for the fertility tree was the garden. Juliano Ave did not exist yet. That road and the continuing education center were all part of the garden.\n\nBefore the animal husbandry building, on what is now Villegas Hall is a barracks, office, and garage. Beside the animal husbandry building was a tiny ice plant that crossed the road but is still part of the camp.\n\nAs I track all of these the sky starts cloudier, air chiller, night is coming close. How did the prisoners felt like when the night is about to come and they were at the middle of their captors?\n\nThe end of argañosa before dtri entrance is a corner of the camp. Across Where a guard house now stands was a chapel.\n\nMadamba street was perhaps alreadt a path back then. At its mouth were sheds outside the barbed wire that enclosed the east side of the camp. I will walk Madamba, look at my right, imagine that these foliage is gone and I would see starving people.\n\nWard street may have been what divided dwellings from nondwelling areas. It may have lead to the end of the camp police, also made up of internees. At the corner of Roxas and Juliano.\n\nIf that's the case this thickly plant covered area may have been the excavated dirt in the map.\n\nWhat copeland gym once was an area where prisoners may have played or done outdoor activities.\n\nI hear a warbling bird in the distance and another bird with a different sound responds.

People organize just to feed them and in the case of ate nadia, she goes by herself to feed them. These people would be appalled that the interns ate cats and dogs at the last days of their imprisonment due to starvation.\n",

    "title": "Lilim: A Weekly Newsletter on Philosophy, Art, and the Outdoors",
    "content": "\n![Kapok and humans](/lilim/images/001/Kapok-and-Humans.jpg)\n\nReceive a weekly essay readable in three to six minutes, which weaves a philosophical insight with reflections on the outdoors and everyday life.\n\n## The Story Behind Lilim\n\nOver the extent of my entire young life, and especially during my lowest moments, I have tried and retried to answer a single question that has always baffled me—How should I live?\n\nI see this question wherever I look and go. I see it in every book I pick up to read, every movie I watch, every artwork I stare at. It has even followed me to places I never imagined it will go—rice fields, lakes, mountains, the voluminous sky, bird songs, the warmth of dog and cat fur.\n\nAnd as I get older, I'm starting to realize that the question eludes an answer. I'm starting to see that its very nature is that of a guide that tells you how to walk but never when to arrive.\n\nPursuing this question has inspired me to write hundreds of [essays](/tags/essays) and journal entries and to draw landscapes and take [photographs](https://www.instagram.com/vinceimbat) to document and remember what I have seen.\n\nThe question has taught me that to try to discern what it means to live as a human being involves not only thinking about life but, perhaps more importantly, experiencing it and finding answers in the real world—outdoors.\n\nThis newsletter is my last attempt to bring to you the insights, observations, and stories, paired with photographs, that I have gathered and continue to gather throughout the years.\n\nIt will try to weave a tapestry that blends ancient and modern philosophical wisdom with humble but awe-inspiring experiences from communing with nature and everyday life.\n\n## Why Lilim?\n\n_Lilim_ is a Tagalog word that, with weird serendipity, captures everything I look forward to in a walk or a bicycle ride outdoors.\n\n_Lilim_ means shade made by any structure that blocks light from above. Usually, it refers to a shade that a tree makes, blocking sunlight, particularly on a very hot summer day.\n\nIn a country like the Philippines, a _lilim_ is a friend of nature lovers. For some, it is the only reason why a walk outdoors is even attractive. Aside from the infrequent dry and cold weather days in the Philippines, which makes a shade-less walk possible, most communion with nature would be done under extreme heat from the sun from as early as nine in the morning to as late as five in the afternoon. To go out and walk in nature with a portable _lilim_, an umbrella, is acceptable but weird. People who walk here are able to do it because of a _lilim_, which is sometimes the canopy of tall trees that cover a forested path. In less forested paths, such as those in the middle of fields I used to walk on in Pangasinan, a _lilim_ is less available, but its sight is welcomed and anticipated.\n\nI envy Thoreau for going out as early as after lunch to go for a walk that would end sometimes until eight in the evening. I am less dedicated to walking I guess—partly because I need to contend with digital distractions than Thoreau didn't and partly because I need to wait for more shade, for more lilim. Thoreau was simply living in a colder place in the world, where the heat from the sun is more tolerable for long, reflective walks.\n\nHere in the Philippines, by four or five in the afternoon, the sun is less hot as it has begun its descent. This is often the time I go out to walk or ride my bike to discover a new path, visit an old one, and just find something new to see. Interestingly, while researching more about the word _lilim_, I discovered that its Pangasinan equivalent, _sirom_, is a synonym of the Tagalog word _dapithapon_ or sunset. _Sirom_ is also a Hiligaynon and Waray word, which means the same thing. Therefore, _lilim_ is not just the shade of trees that I have taken refuge on during many of my walks and bike rides. _Lilim_ is also the time when I took those walks—a time when I would often be alone in the middle of fields as farmers go home after a long day of work.\n\nAt that time, clouds are also more mature, much bigger, creating welcomed shades that block the sun—a phenomenon called by the similarly sounding Tagalog word _lilom_. The best _lilom_ would create beautiful sceneries in the sky: celestial halos, long sun rays, and the much-awaited mackerel sky.\n\nThoreau once observed how shades made by clouds interacted with his emotional state during a walk:\n\n\u003e By the mood of my mind, I suddenly felt dissuaded from continuing my walk, but I observed at the same instant that the shadow of a cloud was passing over the spot on which I stood, though it was of small extent, which if it had no connection with my mood, at any rate suggested how transient and little to be regarded that mood was. I kept on, and in a moment the sun shone on my walk within and without.\n\u003e\n\u003e Journal, July 23, 1851\n\nHowever, even the best lilom will not replace a good shade from an old tree—the perfect _lilim_.\n\nA _lilim_ is where I am allowed to slow down, shift my walk from the dirt road towards the inner paths of my soul. It is where rest is possible, where stillness happens. It is where one’s immediate natural surroundings and one’s intimate thoughts, feelings, and insights begin to converge into a single state of being. It is where one can start to answer life's deepest questions—Why are we here? Where are we going? What does this all mean?—all within the comfortable, existential caress that nature provides.\n\nSo, shall you sit down under this shade, this _lilim_, with me?",

  "/lilim/Lilim-10-Good-Art-Reorganizes-Your-World": {
    "title": "Good Art Reorganizes Your World",
    "content": "![Window at the mall](lilim/images/010/Window-at-the-mall.jpg)\n\nI find it amazing how encountering a certain work of art could change how I [[seeing the world clearly|see the world]] almost instantly. This is what I love about reading [books](/tags/hero-books/), watching films, visiting galleries, and listening to [[My 2019 Musical Diaries|music]]. When the art and the person behind it are the right ones, this internal world reorganization happens easily.\n\nSince practicing [[thoughts/meditation|meditation]] and visiting Nature almost every day, I realized that if I cultivate a daily mindful state, I would feel more at home. I am naturally [[Seven Lessons I Learned Since My Depression In 2011|melancholic]]. This tendency has always been within me. However, I discovered that through mindfulness, I am able to transform this melancholia into an existential feeling where every single thing I see around me, and every single moment, bursts into a supernova of awe and deep appreciation.\n\nThere’s one caveat though—I need a trigger for this to happen. And that trigger is usually a unique and excellent work of art.\n\nThis happened to me recently.\n\nI maintain a digital reading inbox using [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com). A reading inbox is simply a place where we can save reading materials (usually articles) for future consumption. I subscribe to several newsletters like the one you are reading right now, and I review these at least once a week. Some of the newsletters I am subscribed to, like [Austin Kleon’s](https://austinkleon.com/newsletter), contain links to different articles or resources taken from around the Internet. I open these links, take a quick glance through the resource, and if it piqued my interest or if it is related to a project that I am currently doing, I save it on Instapaper.\n\nI usually visit my Instapaper to read when I am on a commute or waiting for someone. Last April, while visiting my girlfriend’s family and waiting for lunch to be served, I decided to open this article from Wired that I saved many months ago. It was entitled [_The Glorious, Almost-Disconnected Boredom of My Walk in Japan_](https://www.wired.com/story/six-weeks-100s-miles-hours-glorious-boredom-japan). Mind you, many of these articles that I save never make it to reading proper. When they have been left untouched for more than two weeks, I usually delete them as that's an indication that they're not that relevant to my current projects. For some reason, I kept this article. I do not know why. It just felt like something I wanted to read later. And I finally read it at that opportunity. And my, was my world changed!\n\nAfter reading the article, I enjoyed it so much—the words and the photographs alike—that I decided to dig deeper into the author and his work. The writer’s name was [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com), and he has been living in Japan for several decades, the last of which he devoted to walking Japan’s beautiful historical and cultural pilgrimage routes.\n\nOn his site, I saw more of his photography and writing. I immersed myself in his love of Japanese culture. Through his work, I felt like Japan, both its breathtaking landscapes and ordinary everyday objects, is an existential paradise, a place where I am reminded of the miracle that is living every single moment.\n\nSuddenly, I was reconnected to a similar feeling, a similar state of mind, I had in the past—during a trip to Coron, Palawan. While riding a boat home after a day of island hopping, I looked far over the horizon. The sun has not yet fully descended, but clouds were covering it, leaving a dim warm yellow light that illuminated the waters. I saw the vastness of it all, the little waves over a quiet ocean making tiny silent movements, with only the boat’s motor to be heard in the background. At that moment, I felt the oneness and interconnectedness of everything. And that was the time I was still reading [Jeff Foster](https://www.facebook.com/LifeWithoutACentre) and exploring Advaita Vedanta. I no longer read him nor agree with his philosophy, but my inner world was similarly reorganized at that time, much like I recently experienced with Craig Mod.\n\nWhat happens after this reorganization is that I usually go about my day, chugging along with my usual activities, but noticing every little nuance—a tiny _maya_ perched on a branch of a tree, a simple window that created a beautiful frame of a scene outside, a leaf twirling around as it hanged on a thread of spider web, and a broken street light that blinks. All of these, I notice, and I can’t stop it. It is as if my senses are heightened and I pay attention easily to almost everything but noise and distraction. I am ever-present, ever mindful.\n\nWhenever this happens, I am more motivated to [take photos](https://www.instagram.com/vinceimbat/) and write. I become more existential and, therefore, [[Lilim 4 - Umbrellaworts and Truth Partners|philosophical]]. I think better and insights come easier. This combination of deep experience of the world and careful meditative thinking creates a rich experience that I try my best to keep as possible.\n\nAnd this is exactly what [[thoughts/henry david thoreau|Thoreau]] did and represented. Like Craig Mod, Thoreau has deeply affected how I see the world and my work. Thoreau was so effective in balancing experience and thought. In the morning he wrote—eventually exclusively about the things he saw in his walks. And I would assume that this was also the time he delved into philosophy and the field of ideas. This was the time he dedicated to getting familiar with his own thoughts—“the children of his mind” as he called them. He cultivated his intellectual and mental process in the morning and cultivated mindfulness, attention, and awe—by taking very long walks and taking notes—in the afternoon until evening.\n\nCraig Mod, with his body of work, has done something similar. He is somehow a modern-day Thoreau. He doesn’t have that many books as Thoreau had nor is he very interested in philosophy as Thoreau was, but like Thoreau, he walks, takes pictures, takes notes, talks to people along the way, and cultivates presence, savoring, and mindfulness—things that even science says will make us happy.\n\nKnowing how great art—no, let’s rephrase that, honest, authentic, joyful art—could completely change how people experience their lives and the world should be enough motivation for any artist to keep going in a path where the destination is not always easy to see.\n",

I will cover my mouth once I’m outside and the first person comes. This is something I say to myself to stop being annoyed with all this mask-wearing.\n\nI picked up my face shield and placed it inside my bag. I usually wear it on top of my head like a headband because—why the fuck are we [still wearing these in the Philippines](https://www.rappler.com/nation/review-sought-mandatory-wearing-face-shields-philippines) when the entire world isn’t already? This is where it stays most of the time unless I enter an establishment. But I am not entering any establishment today. In fact, I’ll just be walking around the neighborhood to see what else I can see.\n\nI realized I still haven’t walked on two nearby streets—Sierra Madre and Banawe. These are the two streets parallel to my street (Mt. Data). I pass by the two of them whenever I walk Onyx Street towards UP. Since I am feeling a little lazy today, I decided to just explore these two streets nearby.\n\nAs I got out the gate, I looked up at the sky and saw that the sun is still up. There are clouds everywhere. Soft light, I said. This is good.\n\nI encountered a quote that I have been pondering a lot recently. James Clear shared it in his [newsletter](https://jamesclear.com). It is a quote from Thomas Mitchell, a well-educated farmer who wrote essays on how to live well in 1913, a few years before the First World War. The compilation of these essays was published in a book I am still about to read—[Essays on Life by Thomas Mitchell, Farmer](https://www.amazon.com/Essays-Life-Thomas-Mitchell-Farmer-ebook/dp/B01N6DCOK2).\n\nThe quote says:\n\n\u003e One of the best secrets of a happy life is the art of extracting comfort and sweetness from every circumstance...\n\u003e\n\u003e People are always looking for happiness at some future time and in some new thing, or some new set of circumstances, in possession of which they some day expect to find themselves. But the fact is, if happiness is not found now, where we are, and as we are, there is little chance of it ever being found. There is a great deal more happiness around us day by day than we have the sense or power to seek and find.\n\u003e\n\u003e If we are to cultivate the art of living, we should cultivate the art of extracting sweetness and comfort out of everything, as the bee goes from flower to flower in search of honey.\n\nI love this bee metaphor to visualize how the process of living a full life happens.\n\nIn a lot of ways, the world is a large field full of experiences (flowers), where we can extract comfort, joy, happiness, or Ginhawa (nectar). Thoreau looked at the world the same way. He likened the sights of the world to a harvest that must be reaped by those who walk in Nature. He wrote in his journal:\n\n\u003e We pass haymakers in every meadow, who may think that we are idlers. But Nature takes care that every nook and crevice is explored by someone. While they look after the open meadows, we farm the tract between the river’s brinks and behold the shores from that side. We, too, are harvesting an annual crop with our eyes, and think you Nature is not glad to display her beauty to us?\n\u003e\n\u003e August 6, 1858\n\nThoreau was a bee and the beauty around him was his nectar. He would walk with a notebook in one hand and a pen in another, jotting down very brief notes about things he sees in his walks—a bird flying by, a small stream breaking the silence, a rainy summer afternoon. In the morning after his walks, he would expand these brief notes into long journal entries, written with so much beauty and care that they turned out to be his most important work.\n\nA honeybee sucks nectar through a long tongue called a proboscis. Thoreau’s proboscis—the thing he uses to extract sweetness and comfort out of everything—is his attention guided by his eyes, which are supported by an external tool, a pen, and a notebook, where the nectar gathered were recorded.\n\nI am currently going deep in photography, and I realized that in a lot of ways, photography makes for a very good proboscis. With mindfulness and a keen eye, a camera can be a powerful tool to capture the sweetness and comfort all around us. In one way, images can even be more powerful tools for this purpose compared to the words we write in a journal.\n\nA camera simply captures light, but the quality and form of that light are informed by many things—the amount of light itself, the subjects in one's surroundings, emotions present in those subjects, movement, etc. And all of these don’t just inform what is captured and recorded. They are all present in that recorded artifact. Words can’t easily do this. They are not as direct as images.\n\nThrough images, the simplest of all flowers—or streets—can be a rich source of beauty. Sierra Madre and Banawe streets are not as visually exciting as the other streets I've walked in. But look at the nectars I have extracted from them.\n\n![Electric meter and roof](lilim/images/011/Electric-meter-and-roof.jpg \"Sky, trees, roof, meter\")\n\n![Electric meters](lilim/images/011/Electric-meters.jpg \"More meters...\")\n\n![Stained gate](lilim/images/011/Stained-gate.jpg \"A gate that has seen years\")\n\n![Japanese dorm](lilim/images/011/Japanese-dorm.jpg \"A Japanese-themed dormitory\")\n\nI like to walk—a lot. But I am too lazy—not to mention too incapable—to capture through words what I see in these walks. And so I take photos instead—try to take at least. Photography allows me to articulate the things I cannot express well through words. It allows me to just shut up—and just look. It trains my eyes to pay attention so that I don't ask for more than what is already in front of me. Instead, I grab what is already here with my bare hands and extract every single drop of sweetness and comfort from it.",

    "content": "\n![The road to IRRI housing](lilim/images/012/To-IRRI.jpg)\n\nHello, my friend,\n\nI want to use this issue to give an update about this [newsletter](/tags/lilim) and my future plans for it. But before that, I want to, first, express once more my sincere gratitude to you for taking the time to read this weekly missive. I know that in this day of information overload, spending five minutes or more reading an email from some random unknown guy on the Internet could be a big sacrifice. I am aware of this and I appreciate the attention you are giving my work so much.\n\nThis is the 12th issue of Lilim—my last attempt to write a regular newsletter. Three months ago, before we started on this journey together, I expressed my hesitation to start it because of my past failed attempts to maintain a regular publishing schedule. I declared to the world (um, actually just a handful of you who are reading this) that if I fail to keep writing this newsletter every week, I will never start one again. Now, because of calendar reminders (thanks Google Calendar!) and repeating task reminders (thanks [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things)!), I am kept accountable to show up every week and write something for you.\n\nIt has been a lot of fun writing stories and essays regularly and complementing these with [photographs](https://www.instagram.com/vinceimbat) I take in my daily walks. I have never felt fully expressed in my entire writing life as I am today. What's more, taking the time to write and revise these essays multiple times a week has helped me hone my voice as a writer. I also came face-to-face with loopholes and unconscious grammar mistakes that I have been making probably for years! There is no better way to get better in writing but to write regularly even if it is just for oneself.\n\nThat said, my [[How I Became a Professional Multipotentialite|multipotentialite]] tendencies are still persistent, and there is so much more I want to do other than writing stories and essays about my walks with philosophical and artistic musings. Right now, I am being called to go back to [[What I Learned From A Year of Reading Thoreau's Journal|translating Thoreau’s journal entries]], a project I want to see through as a published book. I already have a sizable amount of translations, but there is so much more to do before a manuscript can even start to take shape.\n\nAside from this, I am once again being called to study the one question that my entire body of work revolves around— [[About me|\"How should I live?\"]] More specifically, I am beginning to feel that I need to spend more time researching and writing about this question, so I can publish essays about it in this newsletter and in my blog.\n\nBecause of these recent changes in my artistic inclinations, I have decided to experiment with a new Lilim newsletter format starting next week. I will then call the first 12 issues of Lilim as Lilim Season 1.\n\nThe next 12 issues of Lilim will be its second season. In that series, I will still be releasing essays and stories when I have one to share, but I won’t be forcing myself to write one every week. Instead, most Lilim newsletter issues in its second season will contain:\n\n- a photograph from my photo archives,\n- an insight from myself (gathered from my collection of notes I call Talahardin,\n- a quote that has inspired me in the week, and\n- a question for all of us to ponder about.\n\nWith this new format, I expect that you will be able to go through the newsletter in just about three minutes or so. But I am hoping that whatever you find there could affect you much longer than that. A simpler format like this will cut the time I spend preparing the newsletter, and put that extra time into doing research, which I am hoping will improve the essays I will be writing in the future.\n\nOverall, what I am feeling right now is encapsulated in this quote by Emily Carr, a Canadian artist from the first half of the 1900s:\n\n\u003e You will have to experiment and try things out for yourself and you will not be sure of what you are doing. That's all right, you are feeling your way into the thing.\n\nAs I try to keep my promise of maintaining a weekly publishing routine, I am less sure of my direction but more open to possibilities. While I am a very, very intellectual person, I like to \"feel\" myself during these situations—I follow what \"feels\" good and trust that that will make things okay, if not better. I don't like to call this an intuitive process—because it is not. It is more like a dance between feelings and careful thought. And the music playing is \"trust\". It's difficult to dance with that tune. But I keep trying.\n\nAnyways, I'll see you next week with Lilim Season 2. And once again—thank you, thank you, thank you so much for being here. I sincerely hope I can continue to serve you through my humble writing.\n\nLove,\n\nSome Random Unknown Guy from the Internet\n",

    "content": "## A Photograph\n\n![Eyes at Carabao Park](lilim/images/013/eyes-at-carabao-park.jpg)\n\nI’m calling this photo “Eyes on Carabao Park.” I took this yesterday late afternoon while walking back home after a semi-wet quick walk. About two days ago, I went home soaked in rain after staying out too late. I don’t want that to happen again, so I started my wait out of the campus when it started raining and the drops are not yet that big. Rains here in Los Baños are starting to come with strong winds, making any sort of walk difficult. I had to stop to take a photo of those orange lights though. I notice that whoever opens these lights opens them fairly early. What a waste of energy, I thought. But those orange bulbs do look like the eyes—like of an engkanto, perhaps a kapre, looking down from the large tree on the background. Oh my, these rains water the imagination!\n\n## A Thought\n\nWhat we ultimately want is to be in a particular mental state.\n\nWe don’t want physical objects. We want the Mental state we get by having those objects. We don’t want the status that people see. We want the mental state of having that status that we alone can see.\n\nWhat we desire is to revisit a mental state we experienced in the past and which we know is desirable. So, when asked, “What do you want?” our first answer is almost always not the true answer. The true answer is usually behind that first answer or way back.\n\n## A Quote\n\n\u003e The quality of my entire life is the quality of my habitual emotions.\n\n— Tony Robbins\n\n## A Question\n\nWhat is the mental state you desire the most?\n\n\\***\n\n\nThank you for reading.

    "content": "## A Photograph\n\n![House below stairs](lilim/images/014/house-below-stairs.jpeg)\n\nI found these mossy concrete stairs while walking one of the streets that my friends and I have walked in the past. There is something about walking by yourself that makes you notice facets of the environment that you never knew was there before. And those facets break the monotony of walks. They are what you want to see. They’re like a vacation from the walk—a new discovery, dopamine triggers, eye candies, feet candies, worthy of being written down on your diary. And when they do come, sometimes they bring with them something extra on top.\n\nWhen I was walking down these stairs, looking for this angle, this shot, a woman, possibly in her 40s, definitely way older than me, was walking up, talking on her phone and holding a stick—not a walking stick, but a _batuta_. I waited for her to walk past me before opening up my camera. I didn't like another subject crowding this already crowded photo. But after taking this shot, or was it the shot before it, I heard her voice, _“Kuya, kuya, sandali lang. May sasabihin ako.”_\n\nI looked up and she was walking back, down the stairs towards me. I saw her _batuta_ again, and all kinds of thoughts came rushing into my head—“Is she a _tanod_? Or part of the police force that keeps on pestering my walks? Why is she a woman? I have never seen woman police inside UP before. Did I do anything wrong? I have my mask on. Perhaps the shield?”\n\nShe stopped on a stair, socially distant from me, and began uttering the most surprising words I heard that entire afternoon, perhaps even the entire day, or the entire week:\n\n_“Kasi kuya nagpipicture ka diba? Ano, magdasal ka muna bago ka magpicture. Kasi baka mamaya iba na ang mapicturan mo.”_\n\n_“Ah, okay sige po,”_ I said.\n\n## A Thought\n\n**In your work, be a sage and a child.**\n\nWhatever you do, it will be either art or science or both. Either way, you will be more effective and satisfied if you use both focussed and fleeting attention. You need to be able to transition between focus and play. You need to be both a sage and a child.\n\nIn order to do so, you need to have a flexible strategy that facilitates the easy transition between these two states of mind because flexibility requires an equally flexible work structure.\n\n## A Quote\n\n\u003e The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.\n\n— Jeremy Dean\n\n## A Question\n\nWhat is the mental state you desire the most?\n\n\\***\n\n\nThank you for reading.

    "content": "## A Photograph\n\n![Graffiti and walking man](lilim/images/015/Tolerance.jpeg)\n\nTolerance is the reason why a photo like this can exist. A religious building and street art can coexist in one composition because the social context from where the image was taken allows it. Imagine a supra-religio-authoritarian world where everything “blasphemous” is removed, burned, destroyed, bulldozed, and everything the eye can see are just churches and religious relics. In that world, I could have never taken this photo. Conversely, imagine if the world was taken over by punks and every concrete known by man was painted with graffiti. In that world, it would be criminal to build churches, to practice religion, to be devoted to a belief. This photo would have never existed there. I wake up every day feeling grateful for the fact that I live in a pluralistic world, filled with people of different backgrounds and belief systems, counterbalancing each other when one group forces their opinions on another, preventing the rise of a single world order or a single global religion. I was able to compose the image above because I could. I live gratefully but also vigilant that this world could vanish any minute as power converges only to a few and beliefs are normalized not because they are based on facts but because they are espoused by a powerful majority that listens to \"the experts.\"\n\n## A Thought\n\n**We need brave spaces.**\n\nBecause I believe in Pluralism, I believe in a world where everyone could practice their beliefs but still coexist with each other. For coexistence to happen, entities within this plural society will have to tell each other if some of their behavior is undermining their freedom. This is what constitutes a Brave space. One can be in a space where one feels safe and secure but is unable to voice out a contrarian opinion. This is faux security. A true safe space is a brave space, where one is allowed and encouraged to express [[The Art of Navigating Disagreements|disagreement]] if necessary.\n\n## A Quote\n\n\u003e Convincing someone to change their mind is really the process of convincing someone to change their tribe. If they abandon their beliefs, they run the risk of losing social ties. You can’t expect someone to change their mind if you take away their community too. You have to give them somewhere to go.\nNobody wants their worldview torn apart if loneliness is the outcome.\n\n— James Clear\n\n## A Question\n\nWhat one step can you do to start transforming your family or circle of friends into a brave space?\n\n_P.S. Hat tip to my friend Diwa Malaya for first introducing me to the concept of “brave spaces”._\n",

Dorms are emptied by the pandemic, with no assurances of being occupied anytime soon. Then there are also those houses unoccupied for so long even before the pandemic started that termites and the elements, so domineering in forested areas like the campus, have already started to consume. I walked past one during one of my recent walks on the campus. It is one of the widest houses—American-style houses—built for qualified UP employees to live in. I had to stop to admire its size. How can something so large be so dilapidated? The posts that elevate the house are okay. But an entire wall of the house has been opened, and the stairs towards the door are missing several steps. No one can enter the door. Who lived here before? Why was it never inhabited again? Who opened the door last? Who closed it?\n\n## A Thought\n\n**It is necessary to ask the big questions by ourselves.**\n\nWe have outsourced a lot of this asking to people we think are more intelligent than us—philosophers, spiritual leaders, and powerful people. However, these questions are so important to let others do the asking. The answers for these questions determine all the other decisions we do in our life. We need to empower ourselves to ask these questions.\n\nTo do that, we need to make the process easier (i.e., less intimidating) and make it practical and relevant to us.\n\nOne way to make this process easier is by using art to experience, express, and interpret the questions.\n\n## A Quote\n\n\u003e The contemplation of things as they are, without substitution or imposture, without error or confusion, is in itself a nobler thing than a whole harvest of invention.\n\n— Francis Bacon\n\n## A Question\n\nWhat question did you contemplate recently?\n\n\\***\n\n\nThank you for reading.

I'm capping a week of living without Facebook and Messenger by communing with water. I am also going back to work tomorrow—another intense editing marathon for five days, which means no long walks in the afternoon, only short tours on the streets around my place, around 30 minutes—an hour if I am lucky. So I walked today. My pedometer computed 5,000+ steps from my home to the lake. I took the longer cut by using the inner streets to reach the highway rather than the main road. The walk is quieter that way. I try my best to avoid the noise when I walk. Actually, I try my best to avoid the noise wherever and whenever I can. It's the only way I can give myself a chance to hear myself.\n\nIt's the reason why I left Facebook and Messenger this week and honestly contemplating leaving them for good. There are things only heard in silence—usually the best things, the important things. And I heard a lot of that this week.\n\nI don't know what exactly provoked me to leave. I just knew I can't take it anymore. Was it the feed or the chat app? I feel like the latter has gone out of hand more than the former. The feed can be tamed by unfollowing people and no one would know. The chat app is an entirely different animal—rabid, too extroverted, too authoritarian. If you seenzoned people, they’ll get hurt; if you don’t even read their messages, they’ll get hurt; they want you to respond immediately. And it’s not their fault entirely. It’s just how the app was designed. We just follow how it was designed.\n\nCompare that to the silence you get from reading this email. I won’t know when you read this (until I check the report in Mailerlite). I don’t anticipate a response from you. I don’t get hurt if you seenzoned my email. No one is rushing anyone. No one is asking for anyone's attention in real-time. This email can just be an ambient thing that passes through your attention and is deleted or archived after the experience.\n\nThis is how it was designed. This is how I want to talk to you—to anyone—in written form.\n\n## A Thought\n\n**The most critical decision of all is what you do at this moment.**\n\nYou have multiple projects and multiple actions under those projects. The consolidation of these projects and actions could lead you towards your purpose.\n\nHowever, there is only this moment. The most critical decision of all is what you do at this moment—this action.\n\nBecause there is only a single list of actions, whatever you choose to do at this moment is your priority. The act of choosing one thing tells the world that this is what's important for you at this time.\n\nOnce a choice has been made, the next critical step is to make peace with your choice and let go of what you didn’t choose to do. This is only possible if you make sure that what you choose to do is indeed what you need to do.\n\n## A Quote\n\n\u003e Celebrity, even the modest sort that comes to writers, is an unhelpful exercise in self-consciousness. Celebrity is a mask that eats into the face. As soon as one is aware of being ‘somebody,’ to be watched and listened to with extra interest, input ceases, and the performer goes blind and deaf in his over animation.\n\n— John Updike\n\n## A Question\n\nWhat can you do to lessen the noise, so you can hear yourself more?\n\n\\***\n\n\nThank you for reading.

    "content": "## A Photograph\n\n![Champy the cat](lilim/images/018/Champy.jpg)\n\nChampy sits on everything—on my table, on my bed, on my weighing scale, and, yes, recently on my journal. Living with a cat, I find, is like “living in” with a fiance. Every day, or at least every week, you learn something new about her. And I think this familiarity is what ultimately builds the bond (and for some, what breaks it). This happens in any kind of relationship. I mean—isn’t it impossible for me to build a bond with someone I am not “familiar” with? Luckily, for a cat, especially a house cat living with a house person like me, this “familiarity” happens easily, naturally, so subtly I’m amazed it even happened.\n\nJust a few days after adopting Champy, I forgot to close the back door and she got out, never to come back until after two days. I feel guilty feeling this back then but a part of me actually felt good when she left—I mean, I “don’t know her”, I just thought bringing her in was a “kind” thing to do, but I never really knew her. I secretly said, “Good riddance. You don’t want to be helped? Then fine.” But she came back! All perched on the window like a large lizard with her four limbs stretched, meowing loudly as if explaining why she left. She left a second time about a month after this happened, and I was anxious for her to come back. Today, I’m sealing all windows, all doors, all holes around the apartment she might fit into. I might die if she gets out again never to return.\n\nFamiliarity is the foundation on which love can be built. I wonder how much of the hatred and fear existing in the world right now arises out of a lack of familiarity.\n\n## A Thought\n\n**Organization is only possible because of the law of non-contradiction.**\n\nOur mental ability to distinguish between this and that is called the law of non-contradiction. This law of thought was first articulated by Aristotle. It simply means that, for example, given that an apple and an orange have unique characteristics—then an apple and an orange are not the same.\n\nThe law of non-contradiction is so critical in living well. Without this ability, it is impossible to organize anything from the simplest atom to the most complex societies.\n\nWhile some would argue that organization is the antithesis of positive emotions—that we should just \"go with the flow\" and embrace the mess—I would argue that organization actually optimizes freedom—it allows us to free up mental space so that we can experience more positive emotions.\n\nAnd, again, organization is only possible because of our mental ability to distinguish between this and that—the law of non-contradiction.\n\n## A Quote\n\n\u003e The dynamic of friendship is almost always underestimated as a constant force in human life: a diminishing circle of friends is the first terrible diagnostic of a life in deep trouble: of overwork, of too much emphasis on a professional identity, of forgetting who will be there when our armored personalities run into the inevitable natural disasters and vulnerabilities found in even the most average existence.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self, the ultimate touchstone is witness … to have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.\n\n— David Whyte\n\n## A Question\n\nWho is one person you might actually like if you get to know them more?\n\n\\***\n\nThank you for reading.

A few days before that, I just learned the mechanics of cross-provincial traveling—the paperwork and rides—from a friend who has traveled twice during the heavier lockdowns. I took advantage of the opportunity—of less strict travel rules—to get out of Pangasinan and start a new life at Los Baños, Laguna.\n\nLeaving Pangasinan was something I have contemplated for years even before the pandemic. I grew up in Pangasinan and have stayed here for most of my 20s. But deep inside, I knew that I will not be staying here forever. For one, I will not raise a family here. There was just too much history in this place—wounds that are yet to heal, wounds that I will never outgrow as long as I was here. Despite knowing this, some things just kept coming up, which prevented me from building the confidence to start a new life far away from home—a painful breakup from a six-year-long relationship in 2018 and then the insanity-inducing advent of my tinnitus in 2020.\n\nI have played with the idea of leaving this place in my head for so long. The pandemic just made it clear to me last year that it was time. So, no matter how painful it was to leave everything—the view of the Cordillera, the calming green of rice fields, the slow motion of life in the province, the lake I frequented during the lockdowns, Doji, Kako, Chami, my father and mother, I left. And it was the right call. I am in a far better place now—a place more aligned to who I am, not yet perfect but perfectible, a good place to start.\n\nBut why did I came back? No matter the shadows we associate with places we grew up from, we cannot change the fact that at one point we stood upon them, and dug our roots, and sucked on the comforts of their soil. For me, it was the dogs that called me back. Doji died about a month ago—a day right after I thought about going home but decided not to because I was still enjoying the transition and didn’t want to destroy my momentum. But my mom and my dad, they too were calling—silently though, they’ve always been silent. In just eight months, they suddenly grew older, caught some health issues, and are now showing clearer signs that they won’t be here forever. My father was boasting his new senior citizen benefits.\n\nThe old home in Santa Maria is now abandoned. Don’t know if I’ll go there before I go back to Laguna next weekend. Probably. It’s something I can’t not do while I’m around here.\n\nThe photo above was taken in the new house my father has been building for several years now, in Santa Barbara, my mom’s hometown. This was where Doji died last month, and where Kako (in the picture) cried yesterday when she smelled my scent as I sat on one of the wooden benches behind her.\n\n## A Thought\n\n**Do projects that target several goals at the same time.**\n\nYou can only work on a finite number of projects at any given time (due to cognitive, physical, and logistical limitations).\n\nBecause of these constraints, a very wise approach is to choose projects that target several goals at the same time.\n\nTo do this, the following process can be followed:\n\n1. Define all your goals.\n2. List all the projects you want to do.\n3. Compare projects and see if you can combine two, three, or more in such a way that one project fulfills multiple goals.\n\nAn example of a project that targets multiple goals is walking. When I walk, I improve my physical and mental health. I commune with Nature. I could practice photography. Sometimes, I also get to meet people along the way and hear their stories. But most importantly, ideas and insights come to me when my limbs are moving. This is why I also call walking “fieldwork,” because it is what it is—an avenue for fulfilling multiple values and interests.\n\n## A Quote\n\n\u003e There are hundreds of paths up the mountain, all leading in the same direction, so it doesn't matter which path you take. The only one wasting time is the one who runs around and around the mountain, telling everyone that his or her path is wrong.\n\n— Hindu proverb\n\n## A Question\n\nWhat place is calling you to return? What is your answer?\n\n\\***\n\nThank you for reading. If you enjoyed this issue, please consider forwarding to a friend.\n",

    "content": "![Pink cosmos](/lilim/images/002/Pink-Cosmos.jpeg)\n\nHello, my friend,\n\nThis week, I decided to be more intentional about my walks, partly because of encountering Craig Mod but also because I realized how unwise it was not to take full advantage of the place I currently live in.\n\nI am currently living in Los Baños, Laguna, a town 63 kms away from Manila. It is one of the many places in the Philippines that are fortunate enough to be situated in the middle of a mountain and a large body of water. The house I am living at is literally at the foot of Mt. Makiling, while Laguna Lake is just about a 30 minutes walk away.\n\nBefore the latest community quarantine in this part of the country, I went out for walks almost every day inside the University of the Philippines (UP) campus. It is where one can really start to feel the character of Mt. Makiling—trees start to get taller, bird songs become weirder, roads begin to ascend, and the wind starts to get colder.\n\nI relocated here last January and I must admit that I have settled on the comfortable routine of walking on Mt. Makiling’s foot every day. It wasn’t until this week that I decided to look at the map of Los Baños and see where else I might be able to walk. I was astounded after seeing that Mt. Makiling and UP already took about half of the entire municipality of Los Baños. And as long as the quarantine continues, that half remains off-limits to people who want to walk.\n\n![Los Baños Map](/lilim/images/002/Los-Banos-Map.png)\n\nLooking at the map—looking at things as they really are—I realized that there are a plethora of other places I could be walking to. And that is what I did.\n\nMy first line of business was to find a way to see the shore of Laguna Lake. Looking at the map once more, I saw that there are several barangays where roads and the shore seem to converge: Masili, Tadlak, Baybayin, Malinta, Mayondon, and Bayog.\n\n![Laguna lake shores in Los Baños](/lilim/images/002/Laguna-Lake-shores-in-Los-Banos.png)\n\nLast Monday, after visiting my girlfriend at Calamba, I decided to get off earlier at Baybayin and see if I can finally get to Laguna Lake’s shore. Among all the barangays I mentioned above, it has a street that goes directly to the shore: Burgos Street. I followed the map and I finally got to see the shore.\n\n![Laguna lake shore at Baybayin](/lilim/images/002/Laguna-Lake-shore-at-Baybayin.jpeg)\n\nIt was the first time in more than a year that I saw a body of water as large as Laguna Lake. It doesn’t have the same waves you will see from seashores but the largeness of this body of water can create that illusion that one is looking at the sea.\n\nI returned to the lake last Friday but visiting it through a new shore, on a basketball court at the tip of Mayondon.\n\n![Laguna lake shore at Mayondon](/lilim/images/002/Laguna-Lake-shore-at-Mayondon.jpeg)\n\nSeeing Laguna Lake both gladdened and saddened me. I was glad—very glad—that I heard waves again, that I felt that strong wind once more, that I saw the sunset in its most majestic form. But I was also deeply saddened because I realized that I felt, for the first time in what seems like a very long time, the emotions that the pandemic has deprived me—emotions I didn’t even know I was looking for.\n\nIsolation may indeed be saving our lives, but that kind of life we are saving is not a full life. A full life needs the outdoors. And even if I was already frequently outdoors during the quarantines, I now see that those were not enough. Mountains, seas, roads, ridges—they’re all waiting for us.\n\nDuring the old normal, it was already too difficult for many of us to see the beauty that is always around us. The pandemic did not make that any easier.\n\nIt did not just isolate us from each other. It isolated us from the planet, from the simple things that could bring us great joy.\n\nThese are things I am only realizing now even as I write these words.\n\nBeauty is everywhere. It can convince one to continue living and by doing so saves lives. I know, because beauty has saved me more than once.\n\nIf beauty is so critical, so vital in convincing us to \"stay a little bit longer\" in this cruel world, then to see beauty is a skill worth developing.\n\nIt is my sincere wish that this newsletter contributes to your own search for beauty in any way.\n\nMore next week,\n\nVince\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n_P.S. I would love to know what part of the world you are currently living in. Where is your current location and how are you developing your skill of looking for the beauty that is always around you?_",

    "content": "## A Photograph\n\n![Evening at irrigation road](lilim/images/020/evening-irrigation-road.jpg)\n\nI’m back in Los Baños yesterday. We left Pangasinan around one in the afternoon and arrived in Calamba by five. I was in Los Baños by six, carrying a heavy backpack and another bag filled with books. I wanted to walk since, hey, I’m already in LB! But my luggage was too heavy to carry. I called a tricy to help me out.\n\nThe week-long vacation back in Pangasinan was a blast. I brought with me important insights I will be processing in the coming days, some of which I already shared in the previous issue. But in some way, I am also quite relieved to be back home in LB. “Covid peer pressure” was just too strong in Pangasinan.\n\nAll of my relatives have been vaccinated. All of them believe that the virus is the greatest most important enemy they will ever face in their entire life and that they need to do whatever it takes to protect themselves and their loved ones from it. I have many relatives in the medical profession, so it is understandable that they repeat what their superiors in the medical system tell them—the virus is bad! Get vaccinated! Lockdown everything! Fuck the anti-vaxxers! Wear masks everywhere! Forget fun and stay at home for 50 years or until this is all over!\n\nWell, I don't share this enthusiasm. And I am not alone.\n\nI do not deny the existence of the virus. I just don’t think we are showing enough critical thinking about what medical authorities are telling us, especially with these drastic measures they are endorsing that are affecting the economy severely—something that, believe it or not, trickles down to the poorest members of society. And should I mention the toll all of these are taking on our collective mental health? How about the violation of our liberties, e.g., possibly being forced to put something in our body we are not even sure is safe?\n\nBut this isn’t at all surprising. We’re intellectually impatient. We don’t spend enough time thinking about our beliefs, reading enough about ideas that are different from ours. We choose what’s easy and most of the time, what’s easy is what's on our social media feed. Unfortunately, these feeds are designed to confirm our own unchecked biases. And traditional media is not helpful either.\n\nWhen I think about all this covid mayhem, I feel like what I felt while I walked a nearby narrow farm-to-market road on my last evening in Pangasinan. The photo above captures what it looks like to walk by yourself, alone, in the middle of rice fields with only a small light to guide you.\n\nThese are frightening times. But I’m not sure what I should fear more—the virus or how unkind we seem to be to people who don’t share our beliefs about the virus.\n\n## A Thought\n\n**Doubt is an important part of a rich life.**\n\nWhen you doubt your beliefs, you start to listen to the points of view of others. You become more empathetic to your “enemies.” Artificial divisions are diminished and dialogue and conciliation can be more possible.\n\nDoubt has practical benefits as well.\n\nWhen you doubt your current job, you will start looking for other places that can make better use of your talents and strengths. Possibilities are opened. You become more connected to yourself and those you are meant to serve.\n\nDoubt is an important part of a rich life.\n\nDoubt is a space where we finally meet our true selves and those of others.\n\nDoubt leads to freedom, and freedom is a prerequisite to a happier existence.\n\n## A Quote\n\n\u003e What sort of life do we think we are protecting? There is more to life than the avoidance of death. Life is a drink with friends. Life is a crowded football match or a live concert. Life is a family celebration with children and grandchildren. Life is companionship, an arm around one’s back, laughter or tears shared at less than two meters. These things are not just optional extras. They are life itself. They are fundamental to our humanity, to our existence as social beings. Of course death is permanent, whereas joy may be temporarily suspended. But the force of that point depends on how temporary it really is.\n\n— Jonathan Sumption\n\n## A Question\n\nHow much freedom and quality of life are you willing to sacrifice just to avoid death?\n\n\\***\n\nThank you for reading.

    "content": "## A Photograph\n\n![Blanca the dog](lilim/images/021/Blanca.jpg)\n\nDays are getting shorter really fast. When I arrived from Pangasinan last weekend, I could still take some decently lighted photos around 5:30 in the afternoon. Now, it’s completely dark by 6:00.\n\nAbout a few days ago, I was walking at UP around that time. I started my way along Victoria M. Ela Ave., stopping briefly to listen to some church music at the Diocesan Shrine of St. Therese of the Child Jesus. I’m not a Catholic. I just find church songs amazing. I then crossed the bridge over an arm of the Molawin river and turned right at Pili Drive. The plan was to reach Freedom Park through this route.\n\nAt Freedom Park, at the mouth of Manuel L. Roxas Street, there were no lights. Only shadows. There were some lights at the other end of the street. It was those lights that hit a big mass in the middle of the street creating a shadow that was impossible to ignore. When I saw it, I walked a little slower, trying to figure out what it was. Was it a big branch of a tree that fell? Was it a person? It was neither. As I approached the shadow, I saw that it was, in fact, a dog. Lying down, not moving, aside from its occasional breaths. My first immediate thought was to ask for help. But who? Of course, Cats of UPLB, who also feed the dogs here, and who probably know the dog. They replied. Turns out, the dog, whose name was Blanca (a boy), was missing during their feeding time that day. Volunteers from outside the campus went to UPLB, beating the 10 pm curfew, to feed Blanca. Good thing he ate and drank water, they said. They returned the following day to bring Blanca to San Pablo, where he is currently confined. If you’re interested in sending donations for his treatment, which is currently running beyond Php 6k, reply to this email and I’ll send you their donation lines. Alternatively, you may also check the Facebook page of Cats of UPLB for the donation lines and updates on Blanca’s health.\n\n## A Thought\n\n**Freedom requires self-reliance.**\n\nWhen you choose freedom over a middle man or a centralized power, you trade convenience with liberty. Being free is not easy, because when you don’t answer to anyone, you take full responsibility for your actions.\n\n## A Quote\n\n\u003e When we read someone else thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. … Accordingly in reading we are for the most part absolved of the work of thinking. … It stems from this that whoever reads very much and almost the whole day, but in between recovers by thoughtless pastime, gradually loses the ability to think on his own – as someone who always rides forgets in the end how to walk. But such is the case of many scholars: they have read themselves stupid. For constant reading immediately taken up again in every free moment is even more mentally paralysing than constant manual labour, since in the latter we can still muse about our own thoughts. But just as a coiled spring finally loses its elasticity through the sustained pressure of a foreign body, so too the mind through the constant force of other people’s thoughts.\n\n— Arthur Schopenhauer\n\n## A Question\n\nWhat can you do to not lose your ability to think on your own?\n\n\\***\n\nThank you for reading.

    "content": "## A Photograph\n\n![Fish net](lilim/images/022/fish-net.jpeg)\n\nHe just approached me, Kuya Frank did, walked towards another log near the one I was sitting on—driftwoods brought by what I could only imagine was a strong current caused by the previous storm. Wood, trash, and all sorts of things were scattered along the beach. Kuya Frank was holding a mug of coffee. Most probably, instant. He offered me to get one for myself. There’s hot water, he said. I declined, told him I’ll drink mine while I have breakfast later. It was too early for breakfast, and the sea looked alluring—as if telling us to witness its grace this Monday morning.\n\nBut Kuya Frank doesn’t need convincing. He have seen the sea many mornings than he could count. And yet he looked at it still as if he was looking at it the first time. And then he started pointing towards the West. That’s Anilao, he said. We brought many divers there pre-pandemic. Now it’s close. And that’s Bonete, he pointed to an island over the horizon that looked like a round piece of bread. And that’s Calatagan. Fisherfolks from Calatagan still bring their fishes here at Lemery, where prices are higher. Perhaps, there is too much fish in Calatagan, Kuya Frank explained. I noted his supply and demand argument. It was flawless. If you catch 200-300 kilos of fish, that’s a good day, he said. If you can catch that much consistently in a month, you can easily pay for the costs of a big boat—Php 200k—plus Php 100k for the net. I was surprised by the cost of a wooden boat and its net. But that surprise was just a reflection of how ignorant I am—whose ancestors were Austronesian seafarers—about what it meant to live near the sea.\n\nThat’s when I realized I needed to ask Kuya Frank something. I excused myself to get my phone, returned, and showed him a picture of Thoreau’s mackerel sky, then asked, what do you call this sky? _“Ah, kapag ganiyang may kaliskis na ulap, kailangan raw pumalaot sabi ng matatanda, at maraming mahuhuli.”_\n\n## A Thought\n\n**Working on smaller tasks creates a sense of control.**\n\nWhen we break down our work into small and clearly separated tasks, it automatically becomes easier. This is because when tasks are small, it is easy to change course when necessary or just because we want to. This, in turn, creates a sense of control, which stirs us towards pursuing what we really are passionate about. If our work provides us with this sense of control, it becomes a source of motivation, which makes our work sustainable.\n\n## A Quote\n\n\u003e If my hands are fully occupied in holding on to something, I can neither give nor receive.\n\n— Dorothee Sölle\n\n## A Question\n\nWhat’s one thing you’re still holding on to that you should’ve dropped a long time ago?\n\n\\***\n\nThank you for reading.

That tint of yellow on the deck is special—brighter than the already dirtied hull. And that white roof—oh, good choice of color! Not only is it pleasing in the eye, but I also bet it’s cooler inside than most boats. But look closer. The tied is higher than usual, and there’s a new concrete on the pier, where there were once just rocks, lots of them. The lake is calm as usual. The sky calmer. Although cloudy. But they’re not too low as to cover the beautiful blue mountains in the background. Lea and I just sat there, feeding our eyes with all the colors, topping them all with the cool breeze that made tiny waves that hit the pier. It was getting dark and people were starting to flock around the newly built garden where we sat. A Chinese egret from nowhere flew very low in front of us. And then it was gone.\n\n## A Thought\n\nThis is the last issue of Lilim for its second season. I am not sure if there will be a third season. I’ll be taking a break from sending newsletters.

    "content": "\n![Abandoned van](lilim/images/025/abandoned-van.jpeg)\n\nI walk out the door and immediately feel the heat sting. A huge rain cloud is forming in the southwest, but the rest of the sky is azure.\n\nAt Carabao Park, I look up at the trees, and they all feel strange to me. I am in awe, and yet I know none of them. Is this what the ancient animists felt as they bowed beneath these giants?\n\nIt isn’t easy to love that which we cannot name. And it is even more difficult to love that which cannot talk because it cannot tell its story. And we need stories to understand someone. Without stories, I wonder how we can ever love trees, mountains, birds.\n\nIt seems then that the [[seeing the world clearly|natural sciences]] is the language through which we can uncover these stories. A jump-off point for conversing with the natural world. Through science, we observe plants, animals, rocks, soil—all non-speaking entities—to understand where they come from, what they want, where they are going. They talk through their actions, through non-human sounds, and we interpret them by deducing the patterns they create. When I walk and see that the *kapok* has stopped producing new cotton, and those that fell are melting under the sun, I know that it was done colonizing open areas, and summer is closing soon.\n\nPerhaps this is why [[What I Learned From A Year of Reading Thoreau's Journal|Thoreau]] and [[uman/004|Dillard]] cared a lot about  the natural sciences as much as they loved [[On Using Poetry and Story-telling to Express Your Beliefs|poetry]]. Through the natural sciences, they established that familiarity with the subject of their writing. They were able to call plants, animals, and even geographic locations by their names. And with calling them by their names comes the possibility of real connection.\n\n![Lilies and reflections](lilim/images/025/lilies-reflections.jpeg)\n\nThe natural world talks by simply being itself. It speaks by moving, doing what it has to do. Thoreau and Dillard listened through their eyes, ears, tongues, and hands with the lens of science and, from there, responded through poetry.\n\nBut the natural world does not understand the language of man. It does not understand poetry. It only understands the language of action. So when Thoreau and Dillard heard nature and responded through poetry, they were not really talking back to nature. They were talking to their own kind.\n\nNature then is perhaps Deaf. It does not speak words. It speaks through signs. Its language is visual. It makes sounds, but looking at it is enough to get what it is saying. A flower blooms, and you know soon its seeds will burst. It wants to give birth, to continue life. And nature comprehends signs, too, comprehends kindness.\n\nYou can talk about conserving nature nonstop, but nature won’t understand you until you strike a stick to the ground to support a dying plant. Nature talks through actions, listens through actions—actions which Thoreau was not prepared to perform at his time. As he developed his listening to the natural world, he also grappled with questions on vegetarianism and environmentalism. John Muir would be the one to take what Thoreau heard from nature and respond through actions that reverberated through generations—actions that nature finally heard.\n\nThe sound of the palm leaves shaking is like water falling. I say goodbye to the trees and move on.\n\nThe view of Molawin creek from above the never-ending bridge is never-ending beauty. If there ever is a curator of rocks, this part of the creek was curated. At 4 pm, the rocks are photographic. The light that pierces the canopy of trees touches the rocks gently, and the water sparkles from afar.\n\nAlong the rocks, the water flows fast. A mini rapid. Then it weakens as it reaches a large pool, the part of the creek below the bridge itself, which is deeper, rockless. Here, the water rests as if it was its home.\n\nOccasionally, the water crumples. Either something from above falls or something from below moves. Whatever falls, I do not see. Whatever moves below is a mystery.\n\nEverything here is silent if not for the occasional car and walker that passes by the bridge or the birds that glide from one tree to the next.\n\nI leave the bridge and walk for a while along the stoned path beside Umali Hall. I pick up a piece of kapok and sit down on one of the hall’s foundations.\n\nThis kapok is unlike the cotton I use at home. Silky, it feels like the comforters I covered myself with as I finished my thesis in Baguio. The seed around which it is wrapped feels like a dried corn seed. It even looks like it—a dark brown corn seed.\n\nThe kapok takes on the smell of whatever it lands into. As I pick it up, it smells like grass. Now that I hold it in my hand, it smells like the peanuts I ate at home.\n\nI remember Doji’s fur as I roll the kapok between my thumb, index, and middle fingers. It looks like Doji’s fur. It is as if someone cut the hair off one big Doji from heaven, and they all fell from the sky.\n\nI look at all of Doji’s fur around me. Some of them were already melted by previous rains. Some orange bugs seem attracted to the small clover-shaped plants that grow between stones where the *kapok* have fallen. These are tiny orange bugs. As I get up and continue walking the stone path, I notice bigger bugs—also orange—mating out in the open. They look like orange versions of that bug my mom used to hate so much back in Pangasinan. It bites you, and when it does, it leaves a small evil needle beneath your skin. This needle hurts so bad. Bad, bad evil needle.\n\n![Orange bugs](lilim/images/025/orange-bugs.jpeg)\n\nOn the bridge toward IRRI housing, the creek is difficult to see. The foliage is thick. But you can still hear the river flow.\n\nI read a few pages of Dillard’s book as I rest on the side of Drillon road. I raise my head, and I see an unknown bird fly. It vanishes behind a tree. A few seconds later, I hear the air roar, and a thin sheet of a white line appears in the sky. I watch it as it traverses endless blue.\n\nAs I walk back home, the cicadas sound a deafening siren. A black dog barks as it approaches me. On my face, the wind blows as the night weaves a mask of darkness with no eyes.\n",

    "content": "\n![Frogs on greeny water](lilim/images/027/frogs-swimming.jpeg)\n\nHere I am this morning, sitting on my office chair, looking at the gleaming leaves of a thin tree growing outside my window, covering my view of Makiling with a green translucent mask.\n\nI am uncertain whether it is even appropriate to call this a “tree.” Its kind just grows whenever the rain comes. We've had lots of rain in the past few days and boy do these \"trees\" grow fast! The owner of the piece of land outside my window had them cut a few months ago. Now they’re back with vengeance, blocking my once picturesque view of the mountain.\n\nI am in a mild trance looking at the green light when all of a sudden, I see a bubuli crawling around the branches of the tree. At first, the sun skink seems to be going down this one thin branch. But then it goes back up the same branch, as if it realizes that it is going the wrong way. Before it even reaches the tip of the branch, which is too small to carry its weight, the bubuli relocates into a leaf stem. The leaves of this tree are large, but they are less thick than the already thin branch that holds the bubuli. And yet, it feels like the creature is so sure that the leaf stem will be able to carry its weight. It proceeds without any hesitation or fear. Talk about lizard brain!\n\nFrom the leaf stem, it is only a few seconds before the bubuli reaches the large leaf, where there is no stem to support it. Naturally, its weight pulls the lighter leaf, which starts to bend down. At the exact moment when the bubuli would have fallen from the leaf, the animal jumps acrobatically to where it is really going—the sturdier trunk of another tree. It crawls down fast before I can even blink my eyes.\n\nWhat did I just see?\n\n![Small cat over a post](lilim/images/027/white-cat-on-post.jpeg)\n\nIn her masterpiece [*A Pilgrim at Tinker Creek*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12527.Pilgrim_at_Tinker_Creek), Annie Dillard shared that when she was six or seven years old, she would hide pennies under the roots of trees or inside the holes of sidewalks just for fun. She would draw arrows that point toward the pennies and write a label like \"SURPRISE AHEAD.\" She never returned to these pennies and didn't care who would receive them. “A free gift from the universe\" is what she called them.\n\nThen she draws the following comparison:\n\n\u003e There are lots of things to see, unwrapped gifts and free surprises. The world is fairly studded and strewn with pennies cast broadside from a generous hand. But—and this is the point—who gets excited by a mere penny? If you follow one arrow, if you crouch motionless on a bank to watch a tremulous ripple thrill on the water and are rewarded by the sight of a muskrat kit paddling from its den, will you count that sight of a chip of copper only, and go your rueful way? It is dire poverty indeed when a man is so malnourished and fatigued that he won’t stoop to pick up a penny. But if you cultivate a healthy poverty and simplicity, so that finding a penny will literally make your day, then, since the world is in fact planted in pennies, you have with your poverty bought a lifetime of days. It is that simple. What you see is what you get.”\n\nWhat Dillard is proposing is to develop [[Lilim 4 - Umbrellaworts and Truth Partners|a humble eye]]—humble enough to treat small moments of surprise with gratitude and possibly even reverence. This is because, compared to peak experiences that are very rare, these simple, ordinary moments, which Abraham Maslow calls [[uman/004|\"plateau experience\"]] are abundant. They are always here, always around us, if we only care to look.\n\nThese plateau experiences, these surprises, are more reliable sources of inspiration both for times when we need to create or times when we just need to go through a tough day. They are the pennies that a generous hand has left for us to pick up if only we care. And that is the point. If only we care.\n\n![A tiny seed from a tree](lilim/images/027/tree-flower.jpeg)\n\nFor Dillard asks, “Who gets excited by a mere penny?” No one. Almost no one. Everyone wants the big things in life. Everyone wants fireworks—extravagant experiences. Meditators revere samadhi or kensho—the deep self-forgetfulness. Writers worship the rare flow of inspiration. Everyone wants the divine. Almost no one wants [[Lilim 10 - Good Art Reorganizes Your World|the ordinary]], the mundane, the earthly.\n\nBut the big things are big for a reason—there are only a few of them. Few can afford expensive experiences. Few reach samadhi and kensho. Eureka is rare. There is no assurance we can ever get any of them. To rely on the big things for happiness and fulfillment is to set ourselves up for inevitable frustration. And this is while we are surrounded by pennies—millions of them, hidden in plain sight, all under our noses. The air we breathe. The sweet taste of watermelon on a hot day. The sight of little ants on a crooked line. “The world is fairly studded and strewn with pennies cast broadside from a generous hand,” Dillard says. “The world is in fact planted with pennies.”\n\nIf I pick all of them up, I might go home one afternoon with a good thousand in my pocket. But the key is that I have to be poor enough to do this. Otherwise, I wouldn’t care. And that is what Dillard admonishes us never to become: to never get too rich and too proud to crouch and pick up a penny.\n\nThat bubuli, who generously graced me with its presence on this cold and crisp Sunday morning, was one of Dillard’s pennies—an unwrapped gift from the universe.\n\n![A dog waiting at the back of a bike](lilim/images/027/dog-on-bike-basket.jpeg)\n",

Napakarami kong [[Lilim 25 - A Mask of Darkness with No Eyes|hindi pa kilala sa kalikasan]].\n\nBakit ba ako akit na akit sa paglalakad? Sa paghahanap nitong pakiramdam na hindi madaling maipaliwanag? Sa katahimikan at kapayapaan. At bakit ba bagaman akit na akit ako, parang nag-aalinlangan pa akong lumalim? Nakakulong pa rin ba ako rito sa paniniwalang wala sa pag-aaral ng kalikasan ang sagot sa kung paano ba mabuhay? Naniniwala pa rin ba ako na ang sagot ay nasa [[When I Left School I Started Reading a Lot|mga libro lamang]]?\n\nSubalit, ang buhay ay mas arte kaysa sining. Napaka-subjective nito. Kailangan mo munang subukang mabuhay bago mo ito maintindihan. Kailangan mo muna itong maranasan bago mo ito maunwaan.

May puwang pa rin ang mga libro. Maari kang magbasa ng talambuhay at hawaan ang sarili mo ng karunungan. Subalit, dahil buhay ka na bago ka pa man matutong magbasa, wala kang magagawa kundi mabuhay upang matutong mabuhay.

Matagal nanahimik ang pilosopo. Pagkaraan ng ilang minuto, sumagot siya: “Tinuruan ako ng mga librong isinulat ko kung paano umunawa, pero ang problem ay kung ano ang ikinubli nila mula sa akin. Ikinubli nila kung paano mabuhay.”\n\n“Sa tingin mo ba mas magandang maglakad na lamang kaysa magsulat ng isang libro tungkol sa paglalakad?” tanong ng tagapanayam.\n\n“Oo.

  "/lilim/Lilim-29-Why-Walk": {
    "title": "Why Walk?",
    "content": "\n![A man walking at Bay, Laguna](lilim/images/029/Walking-man.jpeg)\n\nMy shoulders started to feel tight. I sensed a slight pain at the bottom of my spine. As I took another step, I grabbed both shoulder straps of my backpack to pull them forward away from my chest. As soon as I did this, I felt my bag's soft but warm cushion on my back, and the pain in my shoulders subsided. I looked in front of me and saw a shadow—a tree! A small one, but enough to take a short standing rest. On my left, two dump trucks moved like tortoises climbing a rock. Behind them, a long line of cars started to form. I stopped under the tree, with the sound of traffic nearby. I turned to my right, and that was when I saw it—one of the three summits of Mt. Banahaw, the active complex volcano of Laguna, often associated with the supernatural. It was there, peering behind thick foliage, as if watching, even mocking me for the fool I made myself become. \"What the fuck am I doing?\" I asked myself as I looked at Mt. Banahaw. \"Why am I walking?\"\n\nI knew I needed to answer this question after walking for more than five hours, with intermittent breaks of 5–10 minutes, from Los Baños to San Pablo, Laguna. It is a full 13-mile walk, half of which was an elevated road that reached 535 feet (0.16 kilometers) max. I did the entire walk from 8:00 am to around 1:00 pm, mostly under a torching sun, which eased after the sky turned gray and beads of water started falling by the end of the walk. I reached San Pablo City by afternoon and found myself sitting at an almost empty diner on the second floor of a building along the city's main street. I was staring down at the road when it started to rain hard.\n\n![One of the three peaks of Mt. Banahaw](lilim/images/029/Banahaw.jpeg)\n\nI was relieved to finally arrive and ordered enough food to congratulate myself with pistachio sans rival at the end of the meal to remind me what it feels like to feel good. The long walk had to feel good, and it did, but it wasn't what I expected it to be. And I know the reason was partly because of rookie mistakes: not putting lotion on my feet (therefore, blisters), bringing more than what was necessary (therefore, backaches), and leaving when the sun was already high (therefore, sunburn on my legs and feet).\n\nBut the walk was difficult, more because I wasn't entirely sure why I was doing it. I could go through something like this and feel a lot better if I am strongly motivated—if I had a vision, I know I am fulfilling as I take one step after another. But this walk had no larger vision. It was entirely a \"let's see if this feels right\" kind of walk. I turned 30 last February, and more than ever, I felt a sense of urgency to articulate what I wanted to do with [[uman/004|the weeks left in my life]]. And I couldn't express what exactly I wanted to do if I hadn't done enough tinkering— if I hadn't [[uman/005|tried stuff]]. This first long multi-day walk was part of this tinkering process.\n\nI knew I liked [[Lilim 1 - Lilim A Weekly Newsletter on Philosophy, Art, and the Outdoors|walking]], perhaps more obsessively than most people. I am surprised by the rigor I put into this thing I am hesitant to call a craft since it is too simple to associate any mastery into. And yet, I feel like it does involve some measure of skill, which attracts me in a visceral, sometimes incomprehensible way. But I need to start uncovering my motivations for doing it. I have to start understanding this drive to walk so that I can begin crafting a vision for it.\n\n![The old San Pablo ice plant](lilim/images/029/San-Pablo-ice-plant.jpeg)\n\n## Walking is Being\n\nMy ultimate life vision has been to understand this world, my place in it, and how I should move in it. I dream of being on my deathbed one day (or wherever death overcomes me) and saying to myself, \"I have lived well. I have lived a life of meaning.\" That is the [[About me|ultimate vision]]. And walking is perhaps an unlikely means to fulfill that.\n\nBut why walk when I could probably be better off dedicating my life to a cause, working with people, and fighting for those in need, as I did in the past? Why choose a mostly solitary activity that is impractical, hard, seemingly selfish, and frighteningly pointless?\n\nA natural extension of articulating a personal vision is to identify the means toward it. Now, a personal vision is, as it sounds, deeply personal. There is no single way to live a life. The question is \"How do I ought to live?\" and not \"How do we ought to live?\" because living is intrinsically subjective, and all attempts to create absolute rules of living that everyone must follow will ultimately fail. Knowing this, it is not enough to craft our vision; we also have to find a way towards it that is true to who we are, regardless of what the outside world tells us we need to be.\n\nThis work is necessary because the path towards fulfilling a vision is perhaps even more important than fulfilling the vision itself. It is impossible to feel good about a vision, to enjoy the journey towards it, if you know you reached it the wrong way—in a way that went against your values. In short, it isn't enough that I become, but I become by simply being me. I need to fulfill a purpose and put meaning into my life in a way that is true to who I am. And for me, walking seems to fit the bill. Walking is who I am.\n\nWalking is me. I was the boy who grew up in the province while frequenting the fields. I was the high schooler who walked by himself from school to town to ride the jeep home. I was the preacher who went from one house to another, sometimes from one mountain to another, on foot to visit the Deaf. I was the depressed young adult who walked under trees and beside beaches to feel good. I was the traveler who hiked mountain after mountain to feel in awe. In walking, I learned simplicity and frugality as much as I learned about myself and my relationship with nature.\n\nWalking, when done right, achieves a lot for me. In walking, I connect with my body, allowing me to see the world as it is. I could practice photography, which is all but the art of seeing the beauty around me and elevating the present moment. Walking is a vehicle for deep thinking as much as it is a rest from it. And walking is an opportunity to listen to me, the world around me, and, when walking with someone, to others. Walking is a microcosm of life, a practice ground for life, if not life itself.\n\n![A man diving at Sampaloc lake](lilim/images/029/Diving-man-Sampaloc-lake.jpeg)\n\n## Walking is Becoming\n\nBut walking is also the best vehicle I know to become who I want to be. Walking is one of the few activities where deep thought and presence—in one's environment and body—can simultaneously occur. Deep presence is necessary to be truly there when something is happening. And we would like to be truly there so we remember, savor, and [[Lilim 11 - Extracting Sweetness and Comfort Out of Everything|extract the sweetness and comfort of an experience]]. We need this because of what happens after deep presence: deep thought. Deep thought is necessary for what I like to call \"meaning-making,\" the practice of interpreting the events that occur in our lives in a way that helps us make sense of them. We want meaning-making because while presence makes sure we are happy and fulfilled at the experience, it isn't enough to satisfy our longing for purpose, for profound meaning. Deep presence assures comfort. Deep thought ensures meaning.\n\nBy being present in my body and the world, I absorb experience, which becomes content for processing, for meaning-making. This cycle between direct experience and its interpretation is what spurs growth. Walking, of course, does not hold a monopoly on this cycle. But I find it an effective platform for my development in a way that feels unquestionably good.\n\nWalking perfectly represents this interplay between experience and thought, even to those who can't or won't walk. We can all \"walk\" figuratively by doing whatever we can to experience the world, to do something besides staying inside our heads. Because when we do come back to our heads, we bring something we can work with—a piece of memory or knowledge to sculpt and shape into whatever we want. This process, I think, is the best way to live. Not to rely solely on the experience of others recorded in books, but to go out there, to be present within our bodies, and to awaken our senses so that we may catch what needs to be acquired: the narratives that will get us through the dark night of the soul if not our whole life. This is what walking does.\n\n![A boat man at Sampaloc lake](lilim/images/029/Boat-man-Sampaloc-lake.jpeg)\n",

    "title": "Parenting in Nature is Our Only Chance",
    "content": "![Lily](/lilim/images/003/Lily.jpg)\n\nI have always wondered why even the most enduring religious, spiritual, philosophical, or psychological traditions can not put an end to violence, why these cannot inspire everyone to show kindness and compassion once and for all.\n\nI think what is imminent from this is that human personality is too complex for a single tradition to claim to be able to influence. A one-size-fits-all approach to transforming people from being selfish and violent to selfless and compassionate is always doomed to fail.\n\nThe things that many of us (even atheists) aspire to—compassion, kindness, love—are things that are not “given”. They are nurtured. Yes, we were born with the capacity to show them (as we are to not show them), but they don’t flourish by themselves. To grow, they need to be revisited and reenacted. In other words, they have to be practiced.\n\nNow, that nurturing starts from childhood. The [science](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_much_of_your_happiness_is_under_your_control) shows that our genetic make up makes us predisposed to certain emotions. I, for example, think that I am genetically prediposed to sadness and anger because, based on self-knowledge and how I scored in the [Big Five Personality Test](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/), I am moderately high in neuroticism. On the other hand, those of us who are more extroverted have a better chance of experiencing more positive emotions.\n\nMost of our parents will never know this. Most of them won’t be able to build a custom-made program to raise us in a way that targets our genetic flaws. The tools and styles they used to raise us are all based on what they knew, which were from their parents too. They think that raising a child is a no-brainer, that it only takes common sense to do it—work hard, earn money, and provide material needs to your children and you’re good. But obviously, that is a very deficient view of parenthood.\n\nAn ideal parent is like a true professional, who should update their knowledge about best practices in their profession and then apply those. But most parents don’t see parenthood as a profession and our society look down on stay-at-home parents. Most of us, especially the parents themselves, don’t see that what they are doing is perhaps the most important job in the world.\n\nChildhood is not our only shot in constructing a better, more compassionate world, but is is a very critical shot—it is the foundation of all our efforts. Of course, even a perfectly raised child could enter the world and see how ugly it is. It could shake them up and make them unlearn everything they knew growing up. But at least, they have something to look back to—a reference and reminder of what is possible.\n\nChildren who were raised in a kind, compassionate household have a first-hand experience of what a kind, compassionate environment is. They know that it is possible because they lived in it. Not all of them can be saved when they start entering society. But some of them will.\n\nWe only have two battlegrounds: home and society. The majority of us will never be able to influence society. Even democratic processes that suppose to give us power are easily manipulated by the already powerful. And anything that an ordinary citizen can do to influence society can easily be eclipsed by larger, richer, and more influential entities.\n\nBut when one takes the role of a parent—an adult that guides young human beings—they don’t realize this often but they just received a very critical privilege of constructing a mini-society inside their own home, a place where government and civic society has less power over.\n\nA home is a little society, which parents can either turn into a democracy or even an anarchic society where children are allowed to follow their own passions, as what happens in unschooling families.\n\nNow here is where Nature becomes a powerful tool for parents to tap. [Nature helps little human beings be more compassionate](https://mountainjournal.org/in-a-time-of-violence-nature-helps-empthy-grow-in-kid). Personally, when I am in nature, I am able to calm down, generate more positive emotions, and process negative emotions better. When I'm down, feeling antsy, or annoyed, I just walk. That's the reason why I cannot live in a place with no trees and nature-filled spaces.\n\nAnd what I find when I walk is that it is just so difficult to hate someone else when you are faced by a beautiful sunset or a star-filled sky enveloping you from above.\n\nParents can incorporate regular nature visits to parenting. A complete retreat from modern society and communion with nature is one of the best tools we have in raising children who would be more resilient when faced by the violent and less compassionate society.\n\nParents should never take parenting lightly—nor nature for that matter. We should make the most out of these two tools. It might be our only chance for building a more beautiful world our hearts know is possible.\n\nUntil next week,\n\nVince\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nP.S. I am not a parent, but I’m an unschooling proponent and this connection between childhood and nature fascinates me. If you are a parent, I would love to know your thoughts about the ideas I mentioned here. Non-parents like me are also welcome to share their.",

The place is small but neat. But one feels that it is trying so hard to become something it isn’t: an authentic Korean restaurant. On the walls, stickers abound, reminding—almost castigating—people to practice social distancing and to keep their noisy little children’s mouths shut. The _bingsu_ is good, although the mangoes are too sour for my liking. The _kimbap_ is not bad.\n\n![Inside Seoul Kitchen](lilim/images/030/seoul-kitchen.jpeg)\n\nAfter seeing Lea ride the jeep home, I walk towards the campus. At the bridge on Royal Palm Ave., two young construction workers were pushing a wheelbarrow. One is holding the left handle with his left hand, and the other is holding the right handle with his right hand, pushing their bodies together in an awkward display. They hobbled at the edge of the road like adult conjoined twins. They reminded me of a similar image I took in Baguio a long time ago of two baggers walking with their arms around each other. It was the best display of bromance I have ever seen.\n\n![Two baggers walking](lilim/images/030/Baguio-bromance.jpg)\n\nAt Freedom Park, I see the lone 7-eleven that closed in 2020. “Temporary store closure,” the sign on its door says. But it hasn’t opened even after stores inside and outside the campus have. It is a reminder of what the pandemic has done. Meanwhile, around the park, a crowd of unmasked joggers, walkers, and picnickers remind me of what life was before the pandemic and what it could be in the months ahead.\n\n![Abandoned 7-eleven](lilim/images/030/711-freedom-park.jpeg)\n\nFurther up the park, I see the marker for the [[uman/005|internment camp]]. I’ve seen it in the past but didn’t care much until I read the accounts of what happened inside that place. The marker sits beside Baker Hall, which is weird because Baker Hall was never part of the camp. The choice of its location was perhaps pragmatic. Let’s put it away from the park itself, away from the grasses where picnickers now sit and football players kick ball, away from where a skull may once have rolled and where grass once turned crimson.\n\nNear the animal science buildings, I see this old tower-like structure that looks like a long chimney. I walk toward it and take some photos from below. The tower is part of a network of buildings that look older than others on the campus, and with face-to-face classes still not fully back, they look more aged and abandoned. I follow the path that cleaved between the buildings, leading me to a [[Lilim 15 - We Need Brave Spaces, Not Safe Spaces|heavily graffitied]] two-story structure that reminded me of stables in cowboy films. The second floor looks like a large conference hall, while the first floor comprises smaller rooms that were, perhaps, previously offices. I study the writings from afar, admiring this piece of public art. Suddenly, a guard appears out of nowhere and starts walking toward me. I look back at the graffitis and take one last photo, pretending not to care. Then I started walking back to where I came from, at a pace faster than usual, doing what any graffiti artist would do.\n\n![A building full of graffiti](lilim/images/030/graffiti-building.jpeg)",

    "content": "\n![One-man trolley](lilim/images/031/one-man-trolley.jpg)\n\nThere is something magical about walking beside the railroad at San Jose, on a crisp summer morning. An ironic silence wraps over and under the tracks, amplified by the thin fog that hazes metal, stone, and wood. At first, you won’t see a single soul walking here at this time of the day. The narrow concrete road beside the tracks is fair game for any solitary saunterer. And yet—and you only get this once you’ve stayed here for at least a couple of days—you know that any minute now, a noisy trolley, which locals call “skates,” would appear. You anticipate its arrival, and this dance between silence and anticipation creates that magic.\n\nThe trolley could come either from behind or in front of you. Only the squeal of metal announces the arrival of one or two or even three of these humble modes of transportation. On Sundays, expect many of them, mostly carrying families visiting the resorts along Lopez Bay. But some would also carry hollow blocks, gallons of water, or tubs full of fish. When several of them are about to occupy a specific segment of the railroad, you will witness an interesting theatre of _bigayan_ (literally, “giving way”), a stronger flavor of what you would experience when riding the more popular jeep.\n\n![Railroad crossing a bridge at San Jose](lilim/images/031/sta-teresa-bridge.jpg)\n\nInside the jeep, especially in the Tagalog regions where drivers are without conductors, anyone who rides these public utility vehicles is expected to observe two main rules: (1) Let seniors and people with disabilities occupy the seats nearest the entrance and (2) help the driver collect the fare from other passengers by receiving the money, reaching out, and handing it over to a passenger nearer the driver. You are expected to perform this last rule, even if the passenger paying the fare hands their money over to you without saying “please” or “thank you.” It is a felt rule (_pakiramdaman_), which Westerners or even other Asians visiting the country and riding the jeep for the first time will never fully understand. And yet, it reflects one of the deepest cultural values Filipinos share—_bigayan_—a value that is, admittedly, on a decline as newer, more individualistic values challenge it. There are other rules inside the jeep, like women should never _sabit_ or hold on to the handrails at the entrance of the jeep, so one can ride without sitting. _Sabit_ usually happens when passengers are desperate to go home, and jeeps are already scarce. It’s traditionally taboo to see women, especially in a skirt, hanging behind jeeps. Men inside are expected to trade seats with women. But these rules are already being broken or are seldom applied.\n\n![Trolleys and coffee](lilim/images/031/skates-and-coffee.JPG)\n\nIn abandoned railroads, such as this in San Jose, trolleys are king, and _bigayan_ takes on a more complex and interesting personality. Only a single trolley could use a stretch of the railroad at any time. This means that if two, three, or even four trolleys meet at a section of the railroad, only one can use the tracks first, and everyone else will wait for their turn. This constraint triggers a swift but beautiful display of _bigayan_, facilitated not with words but with _pakiramdaman_. Every single trolley driver knows these felt rules. They know if they need to give way or if they hold the right to use the rails first, and the decision-making happens in about three to five seconds. Once a decision has been made, passengers stand up, get off the trolley, move to the concrete road beside the rails, then the driver carries the trolley (thankfully, it is mostly wood) and parks it on the side. Boom. Boom. Boom. One after another, lego pieces fall beautifully into place.\n\nThe felt rules that make such a display of _pakikipagkapwa_ (fellowship) possible are as follows:\n1. **More people trump fewer people.** The trolley with the least number of people in it should give way to trolleys with more people.\n2. **More baggage trump fewer baggage.** Even if there are fewer people in a trolley, if the trolley contains more baggage, the trolley with people with no or less baggage will give way.\n3. **Heavier and fragile baggage trump normal baggage.** Trolleys with baggage that are hard to carry or are fragile (e.g., sacks of rice, gallons of water, hallow blocks, etc.) should pass first.\n4. **More trolleys in one direction trump fewer trolleys in the opposite direction.** Multiple trolleys going in the same direction should pass first, and a single or fewer trolleys going in the opposite direction should give way, except if they contain baggage mentioned in rule 3.\n\nIdeally, the driver who ought to give way has to make a judgment call while his trolley is still reasonably far from the trolley who is entitled to first use the rails. This prompt decision prevents waste of time and signals other trolley drivers that he knows the rules. If the driver makes a very late judgment call, the other drivers will let him know.\n\nThis morning, there were no trolleys on this segment of the rails in San Jose. Only cold air runs over the immovable metals. After crossing the bridge, I saw a trail on my right, which led to several fishponds. A white dog appeared behind me and entered the path, walking briskly over soft mud.\n\nNothing was happening on the rails of San Jose.\n\nSo, I entered the trail and followed the dog.\n\n![Trolleys in black and white](lilim/images/031/trolleys-bw.JPG)",

    "content": "\n![A fisherman's house](lilim/images/032/fisherman-house.JPG)\n\nThe white dog walked briskly on the muddy trail, a _pilapil_. Its small feet seem to float over the soil and led the animal as if they have a mind of their own. They know this trail, for they probably walk it every day. I couldn't keep up.\n\nNot far from where I started, the mud began to get softer, and my heavy feet pressed on the ground. They couldn't float over the soil, so I am unable to go any further.\n\nI stood up instead and looked around me. Nearby, I saw a fisherman's house built on the banks of the fishpond over the water. Some clothes hang outside under the _nipa_ roof. If those clothes fall, which they will by a strong wind, they will fall directly into the water, which reflects the house and the trees behind it.\n\nIn front of me, on the trail, a few long bamboo poles were lying down. They are big enough to build a bridge over these fishponds, but not big enough to provide structure for a house. Someone left them here, but he'll return to get them back when the soil on the trail starts to harden again. Over the horizon, large cumulus clouds begin forming over the blue sky.\n\n![Bamboos on a trail](lilim/images/032/bamboo-on-trail.JPG)\n\nMy eyes got tired of looking around. Perhaps they were trying to do the walking I couldn't do now. My feet couldn't float over the muddy trail. But my eyes, my eyes could do the floating anytime, anywhere. And yet, they are tired, so I settled my gaze on the water and the banks of this fishpond below my feet. I crouched and looked for what I could find.\n\nA few young mangroves grew here. Around one mangrove, I saw something move fast over the mud. It was almost invisible. Its color blended with the ground and was very, very tiny. Here, the locals call it _tustusak_ or _mananaltak_. A Google search would say it is a mudskipper. This one is so small, it is probably a baby—but a baby who knows how to swim, who knows these waters, and who moves really fast.\n\nNot far from it, something larger began to move. It had an irregularly circular form. Whatever was underneath it, it patiently carried that dome. Meanwhile, on a dead mangrove branch nearby, a cone-shaped shell was also on a very, very slow expedition. I was looking at both shells, patiently waiting for whoever completes its journey first, when, out of nowhere, a gray _katang_ (crab) walked sideways between the two.\n\nI stood back up, still smiling, my legs a little cramped. The cumulus clouds over the horizon grew much bigger, and what was once a bright morning was starting to dim. I couldn't walk this trail, but it didn't matter. The creatures I saw were enough. Like my eyes, they did the walking for me.\n\nI started my way back to the railroad when a large figure swam under a forest of mangroves on my right. It stopped, as if it sensed my movement when I stopped. I moved slightly, and it too moved, swimming towards the next mangrove. This time, I looked at it intently, reminding me of the _tustusak_ I saw just a while ago. But this had a brighter color, yellow-green, and it was bigger, much, much bigger. So, this is how they look like as adults.\n\nThey say that mudskippers are fishes that learned to walk on land. Some speculate that they are the ancestors of four-limbed vertebrates, like apes, where we came from. If they are right, I am looking at my grandfather or grandmother right now. And that is a good thought to end this very, very short walk.\n\n![A bamboo bridge](lilim/images/032/bamboo-bridge.JPG)",

    "title": "Umbrellaworts and Truth Partners",
    "content": "![Umbrellaworts](/lilim/images/004/Umbrellaworts.jpg)\n\nDuring a not-so-long-ago walk, I saw these two flowers on the same patch of soil. They look entirely the same; only their colors were different. One was yellow; the other was fuchsia. They grew underneath the walls of a large school run by the religious, so I am not sure whether they were cultivated or whether they were wild.\n\nI later learned that they were Umbrellaworts or four-o’clocks, named after the time of the day when their flowers open. I usually walk around 4 or 5 in the afternoon, so perhaps it made sense that I saw these bright flowers at that time.\n\nSince I didn’t know their identity at that moment, what struck me was the duality of their colors, their being together, their being the same yet different. It reminded of a new friend I recently found from the vast world of the Internet. This friend filled a void that I didn’t have for quite some time—a void that made me feel less complete in my search for truth.\n\nWe all need partners—conversation partners—but more so if we are interested in the truth. While I still think that the search for an accurate description of reality should always start and end within oneself, I also find that we need others to make this search sustainable. Otherwise, it can be a long lonely monologue.\n\nBut a truth partner performs an even more important role. My new friend shared me this quote from Marcus Aurelius a few weeks ago:\n\n“If anyone can refute me, show me I’m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective, I’ll gladly change. It’s the truth I’m after, and the truth never harmed anyone.”\n\nI love this so much! To achieve any success in a journey to truth, one needs to embrace this kind of humility—a humility, which in turn, encourages one to embrace openness.\n\nBut it can also feel the other way around. Maybe I know something that my truth partner would need to know. I should be ready to perform the role of an accountable honest friend who is brave enough to say when he disagrees and offer a better perspective.\n\nObviously, we are so infallible as human beings, and our efforts to share our perspective could easily lead to self-righteous criticism if we aren’t careful. That said, it is this very infallibility of our minds that necessitates dialogue. The quest for truth will only get better through talking to someone.\n\nAnd even if we come to philosophy not to understand the world or to take advantage of what Socrates called the “medicine for the soul” which philosophy provides, what better medicine can we get than a friendly conversation with an honest and kind truth seeker, perhaps late in a summer afternoon while walking and being amazed with umbrellaworts.",

    "content": "![Child on rocks](lilim/images/005/child-on-rocks.jpeg)\n\n“We as a couple. We choose to be anonymous.”\n\nShe said as she looked me straight in the eye, her stare piercing as if to stress that this is something very important to her.\n\n“But I will share the video on social media so that others could benefit from it,” she ended.\n\nThis is my dull attempt to remember the exact words said on that Tuesday afternoon, while a torrential rain poured outside, water falling from the tall trees that covered the wide single-floor house we were all cozied in.\n\nI was sitting beside two friends with whom I woke up early to see what flowering trees are left around the campus. I thought we would be done in a couple of hours that I even elected to not feed my cats until I got back home. But after having omelet brunch together with the new friends they introduced me to, we were still there outside, 3 pm, while my cats purred in hunger back at home.\n\nI think we were drinking chocolate while this conversation happened. And mind you, this was just after we ate chocolate. All that chocolate in my system helped me pay attention—I heard everything my new friend said amidst the loud downpour of rain over the steel roof.\n\n## Freebirth\n\nThe video she was referring to was a video of her giving birth to her son by herself, with her husband only watching and documenting the entire process. She was a believer of autonomous birthing—a philosophy of giving birth where the pregnant woman directs how everything happens. This self-direction extends to things that should happen before and after the birthing.\n\nShe did not go through any conventional program that most soon-to-be mothers go through before giving birth. She did not go through a nutritional program under a physician nor fasted before giving birth—a protocol that doctors give so that, in the event a woman needs to undergo a cesarian section, it would be easier for them to perform it.\n\nShe did not push for her son to come out. She waited, letting her body and son communicate to do the process naturally. And when her son came out, after about 11 hours of labor, no one cut the umbilical cord. She and her husband waited for about 30 minutes—enough time for the blood from the placenta to transfer from mother to child through the umbilical cord. After 30 minutes, she had another contraction, this was her second birth—the birth of the placenta, the wonder organ of pregnancy, which most of us take for granted. She and her husband, gently tugged the umbilical cord until the placenta slipped out of her, physically separating mother and child for the first time.\n\nHer son will stay connected with the umbilical cord and the placenta for five more days until the cord naturally separated from the child. This process was beautifully called \"lotus birth\"—birthing the child intact with the cord and the placenta.\n\nI am writing this, still in awe of the story. And if you are curious, yes, I watched the video of her giving birth—a shortened 11-minute video cut from the entire footage (Update: My friend and her husband have generously released an even shorter version of the freebirth video online. You can now watch it below).\n\n{{\u003c youtube n6U5vEfqe2Q \u003e}}\n\n## Birthing and Autonomy\n\nIt was my first time to watch someone give birth and it is one of the most eye-opening things I’ve ever seen. My life is completely different after seeing the footage. I felt a strong feeling of gratitude to my mother and my sister, both mothers of three children, as I was watching the video.\n\nBut when I went home that night, and in the following days, what the entire experience left me was an affirmation of one of my deepest values—a value so intricately weaved in everything that I do and want to see in the world. A value that even Nature teaches us.\n\nThat value is autonomy.\n\nLike my friend and her husband, I am a believer of autonomy. I believe in autonomy because it is impossible for me to feel good and to live well without feeling free. What makes me feel good is a very personal and subjective thing. What makes me feel good is not necessarily what makes you feel good—or what makes the majority of people feel good for that matter.\n\nFor example, walking alone or with friends in Nature is fun for me. But I bet not everyone could stand the silence and stillness of the mind required in such an activity. Most people would rather listen to music or go to a party to have “fun.”\n\nNow, here is where autonomy enters. Imagine if someone or the state, for example, imposes a law where everyone is required to have fun ONLY by walking alone in Nature!\n\nSuch a rule is unfair. Walking alone in Nature is not fun for many people. It is not what makes them feel good. And yet all of us need to follow such a rule because of fear. We fear punishment and so we give our freedom away. We are stripped off of our autonomy and made to submit to such a preposterous rule!\n\nNow extend this scenario in everything that we hold dear in life—education, health, childbirth, work. What you get is a very unhappy world of people with no sense of free will, where everyone does the same, and everyone has forgotten what makes them feel good.\n\n## Autonomy is Essential to Self-actualization\n\nIn order for us to feel true happiness, we need to be able to govern our lives, to have the ability to dictate what we want to do, when, and how. The more autonomy we have, the more power we have in curating our context. The more power we have in curating our context, the bigger our possibility of experiencing positive emotions. Optimal happiness can only be achieved in a world where individual freedom is optimized first.\n\nAnd if that isn’t enough to convince you how good freedom is for you, then it might help for you to know that according to studies, people who feel free are more motivated and have [longer lives](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1976-28515-001).\n\nFor sure, freedom is not easy, because freedom requires self-reliance, and oh boy, do we fear relying on ourselves!\n\nBut between dependence on authority and freedom to create our own lives, the latter is closer to what we know deep within us is good for us. And what better way of building a world of autonomy than letting mothers bring their children to the world in full freedom.",

    "title": "A Walk Around HEAL",
    "content": "![Sky at HEAL](lilim/images/006/Sky-at-HEAL.jpeg)\n\nI thought the road will never end.\n\nOn the left was a large piece of land, mostly uncultivated, unfenced, filled with _talahib_, and encircled by large trees, probably mahogany. Trees lined up that side of the road, creating a natural border that prevents trespassers from entering.\n\nWhoever owns the land may have lost interest in it. Perhaps because it was too far from town or because they had no enough resources to develop such a large estate. Whatever their reason, birds, reptiles, insects, and weeds are happy about it. They rejoice for the success of their very own crusade to reclaim what was their ancestors’ land. The more disinterested people are about their lands the better it is for them.\n\nOn the right side of the road were several houses, many of them clustered together and separated from other houses by smaller pieces of uncultivated land. The grass on this side is short and goats graze on whatever is left in them. There were also very few trees and even little human activity.\n\nThis place is silent, I told myself—a perfect place to build a farm.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI was already the only passenger in the tricycle when we entered this never-ending road. I paid extra for the driver to bring me directly to HEAL, the permaculture farm I was visiting. We left town full—three inside the main carriage then two outside, along with the driver, who had to move a seat forward towards the motor’s gasoline tank to accommodate both of us behind him.\n\nI always pity tricycle drivers whenever they do that. To earn more, they had to put another body behind them. This forces them to sit in a very uncomfortable position—their groin over the gasoline tank and closer to the steering rod, their legs folded as if already kneeling, and their heads bowed down while, of course, looking in front of them. But I am not sure what I am more afraid of—the driver’s legs breaking or the tricycle tumbling altogether.\n\nAs I neared my destination, the tricycle started emptying up—one passenger after another. When the main carriage was empty, I had the option to go in. However, I chose to stay behind the driver, where I had a closer view of what was happening outside.\n\nThe illusion of the never-ending road was an illusion after all. After just around three minutes, I saw the end of the road—an open gate with large letters painted all over it:\n\nHEAL\n\nHAVEN FOR ECOLOGICAL AND ALTERNATIVE LIVING\n\nMEDICAL MISSION SISTERS\n\nI got off the tricycle, gave P40 to the driver, thanked him, and started my way in.\n\nI started walking towards the first visible structure—a small two-story house covered in green.\n\n![Heal Gate](lilim/images/006/HEAL-Gate.jpeg)\n\nAs I made my way towards the house, I felt a sense of relief. The travel was too long for a place that seems just near. To get here from our house in San Jacinto, I had to ride the bus from Dagupan bound to Cubao, which passes in front of our house and stops at Manaoag, the popular pilgrimage town. There, it waits for 30 minutes to get filled up. To catch it, I could either wait for it in front of our house or ride a jeep to Manaoag, hoping that the bus is still there. I usually do the latter as, most of the time, the bus is indeed still there, cutting my waiting time. If I wait for it back home, I will still wait for another 30 minutes once we get to Manaoag.\n\nWhile on the bus, we passed over several towns in Eastern Pangasinan—Laoac, Binalonan, and Urdaneta. These are the new towns, differentiated from the old towns by the sheer number of Ilocano-speaking people that inhabit them. In the early 1800s, Ilocanos began their diaspora from Ilocos to nearby provinces, populating thousands of acres of open arable land. Since most Pangasinan-speaking folks lived near the coastal areas of the province, the inner forests and grasslands were left open to migrants to cut, cultivate, and develop. These areas became the Ilocano-speaking towns of Pangasinan.\n\nAfter Urdaneta, our bus arrived at Villasis, the second to the last Ilocano-speaking town of Pangasinan that the bus passes by before entering Tarlac. The bus dropped us at the famous vegetable market or _bagsakan_ and behind it, I started looking for a tricycle bound to Capulaan. I found one and waited for it to get filled.\n\nAfter waiting, it was still a long ride from town to HEAL. The view along the way is mostly fields—sometimes rice, sometimes onions, other times just a small patch of a vegetable garden. I remember seeing wide wooden trellises filled with ampalaya in one of the wide fields we passed along the way.\n\nI wouldn’t say that the travel from San Jacinto to here was arduous, only that it was longer than usual. And so I felt relieved to finally arrive, especially after seeing how well-shaded the farm was. There were large trees everywhere—very large trees.\n\nBefore coming here, I communicated with Sr. Lynn, one of the five senior nuns living on the farm. I got her number from their website. She was supposed to meet me, so I texted her when I arrived. She replied and asked me to wait.\n\nI arrived at the two-story house surrounded by plants. It had a cemented first floor and a wooden second floor. An old woman was sitting on a tiny chair outside the door. I greeted her and she greeted me back. I would later know that this was Sr. Naty, the oldest nun living at HEAL.\n\n![HEAL House](lilim/images/006/HEAL-House.jpeg)\n\nI chatted with Sr. Naty for a while until Sr. Lynn finally showed up and welcomed me. She asked me to follow her to a large open building in the middle of tall trees. Like the previous building, this structure had a foundation built using concrete but with kawayan and wood on its walls and second floor.\n\n“We tried building with pure wood alone, but termites are so ferocious here in Pangasinan. We decided to use cement even for just our foundations,” Sr. Lynn explained.\n\n![Sr. Lynn](lilim/images/006/Sr.-Lynn.jpeg)\n\nThe first floor was mostly open. There were almost no walls covering it, only those that covered rooms. The second floor was of course walled for safety purposes. It had several beds lined up one after another, covered and divided only by large boards of rattan, which made it look like a dorm of some sort. This is where the nuns accommodate guests or retreat participants, which frequent HEAL every year.\n\n![HEAL dorm downstairs](lilim/images/006/HEAL-Dorm-downstairs.jpeg)\n\n![HEAL dorm upstairs](lilim/images/006/HEAL-Dorm-upstairs.jpeg)\n\n“If you opt to start volunteering here, you will be staying here for the night, Vince. I hope you don’t mind that the space here is mostly open. And please don’t be afraid of rats. When you see them walking around, they’re probably hunting for snakes,” Sr. Lynn shared. She continued saying that they don’t kill snakes here. When a snake is lost inside any of the farm's buildings, they pick it up using a stick and put it back to the rice fields so it could find its way back home. In Sta. Maria, we killed all snakes we see.\n\nI was not sure what bothered me more, the mention of rats or the mention of snakes. But whatever. I was here to learn about a different way to live and not even rats or snakes could derail me from that.\n\nAfter showing me the accommodation building, Sr. Lynn guided me to the immediate surroundings outside. She showed me a short tree with clusters of round, green plump fruits surrounding its trunk. They covered the trunk so much that they looked like parasites—children pulling down an old woman to the ground. The fruits were too many they were falling around the poor tree. The tree was really short, just about five meters, and I felt like these bunches of fruits were making her even shorter.\n\n“Where this tree grows, there is water. Thus, it is called _tibig_,” Sr. Lynn said.\n\nThe tree is one of several indigenous trees that the nuns planted around HEAL. As I spent more time on the farm, I learned more about our indigenous trees and their relationship with plants introduced from outside the Philippines. But the _tibig_ tree was special because it made me realize how little I knew about the trees that flourished in this country long before I was even born.\n\n![Tibig](lilim/images/006/Tibig.jpeg)\n\nBeside the _tibig_ tree was a large box that looked like a treasure chest with a green cover. It stood with four long legs. Sr. Lynn laid her hand on the box and started explaining that this box used to house honeybees during a time when the farm attempted to keep them.\n\nSr. Lynn also showed their plant nursery and the mandala-shaped vegetable beds in the middle of the farm.\n\n![HEAL Nursery](lilim/images/006/HEAL-Nursery.jpeg)\n\n![HEAL Salad Bowl](lilim/images/006/HEAL-Salad-Bowl.jpeg)\n\nBut what really fascinated me was their vermicompost facility. Housed under a structure made of bamboo and _nipa_ were three concrete containers filled with what looked at first like soil and rotting vegetables and leaves. Sr. Lynn introduced me to Julius, one of the three or four gardeners working full-time at HEAL. He was about my age but is already a father of one. He was in charge of the vermicompost and he explained to me the basics of what was happening in front of me.\n\nThe rightmost container held the raw materials for composting—mostly made up of vegetable scraps but also chopped banana trunks and other materials that are intentionally introduced by Julius. These served as food for the vermiculture worms that live underneath the container. They eat the scraps and excrete them into a very potent fertilizer—the vermicast. When vermicast accumulates, Julius shovels and transfers them into the two containers on the left, where they are later harvested for farm use. Sometimes, they are also sold for extra income. I’ve never heard of vermiculture before and so this really fascinated me.\n\n![HEAL Vermicompost](lilim/images/006/HEAL-Vermicompost.jpeg)\n\nAfter leaving Julius, Sr. Lynn showed me their vegetable trellises and greenhouses.\n\n![HEAL vegetable trellises](lilim/images/006/HEAL-vegetable-trellises.jpeg)\n\nThen she showed me this fascinating shrub that had pointed leaves, red stems, and pink flowers.\n\n“This is the roselle. I learned from the local people that they use the flower to cook _sinigang_. But we also use it to make jam,” Sr. Lynn shared.\n\nThis comment was interesting to me because Pangasinan-speaking folk do not use this flower in cooking _sinigang_. This practice seems to be an Ilocano practice and so was hidden from my knowledge for a very long time until now.\n\n![HEAL windmills](lilim/images/006/HEAL-windmill.jpeg)\n\nAs Sr. Lynn continued her tour of the farm, I can’t help but notice this large structure that loomed above trees all over HEAL. It looked like a windmill with a large container underneath it. When I asked Sr. Lynn about the structure, she said that it harbors wind energy to extract water from the ground, which then fills up the container. This structure helps HEAL become more self-sufficient in its water supply.\n\nFittingly, Sr. Lynn ended our tour at the farm’s chapel—a relatively small circular structure, which like most buildings in HEAL, had a concrete foundation but wooden frames all throughout. And like the other structures, it was open-aired.\n\n![HEAL chapel](lilim/images/006/HEAL-Chapel.jpeg)\n\n![HEAL cross](lilim/images/006/HEAL-Cross.jpeg)\n\nThere was an altar in front of chairs arranged in a semi-circle. A gong was nearby, perhaps used as a time-keeping instrument throughout religious services. There was a guitar on the side, as well as a podium and a table with images and icons.\n\nBut the most striking of all the objects in the chapel was the cross—two rugged wooden planks attached together, beautifully adorned with garments and paint, with a three-fingered branch of a tree nailed on them. This branch was Jesus—faceless like the earth.\n\nIt had a raw, laid-back look that camouflaged with its surrounding, almost concealed by the colors of the trees, the branches, the wood that filled all of HEAL.\n\nI am not a Catholic and have long left the Christian path. But there is something about the humility of this cross that resonated with me deeply.\n\nI left HEAL in the afternoon, promising to go back soon to start volunteering. I planned on trying out just two days, sleeping over for a night, to test if doing work on the farm will suit me.\n\nI walked the same narrow road that led me to this quiet abode in Villasis.\n\nI looked at the same trees, the same rocks, the same sky.\n\nBut, oh, how different they were!",

Tubig lang ito na nahuhulog mula sa kalsada at dumadausdos sa malalaking bato sa ibaba. Mala-falls, pero hindi talaga falls.\n\nNatetempt tuloy akong tawagin siyang False.\n\nNakita ko ang anino ko sa umaagos na tubig habang tinatawid ko ang kalsada. Tumigil ako upang piktyuran siya.\n\n![Shadow](lilim/images/007/Anino.jpeg)\n\nMukhang artipisyal ang falls na ‘to, pero ang tubig nito ay tubig ng Bumbungan River. Hindi ko alam saan eksakto nanggagaling ang tubig sa ilog na’to, pero sa mapa, dinaraanan nito ang ilang barangay ng Cavinti. May twin falls pa nga na Bumbungan rin ang pangalan! Ang mga ito talaga ang tunay na mga falls. Pero hindi ata sila masyadong kilala dahil wala sila sa Google maps.\n\nSigurado akong galing sa bulubundukin ng probinsya ng Quezon ang tubig ng Bumbungan River. Napakalayo ng tinawid ng tubig na ito para lamang umagos sa kinatatayuan ko at hugasan ang mga libag ko sa paa. Tapos, magniniig sila ng mga tubig ng Cavinti River at sabay bubulusok sa mga talon ng Pagsanjan at Naculo kung saan sila pagpipiyestahan ng mga tao.\n\nAy, 'wag naman sana nilang malunok ang pinaghugasan ko.\n\n![Bumbungan river](lilim/images/007/Bumbungan-River.png)\n\nPagkatapos kong maghugas, iniwan ko na ang False at sinundan ang kalmadong agos ng tubig na nagsususuot sa gahiganteng mga bato sa gilid at gitna ng ilog.\n\nHinulog ba ng mga trak ang mga batong ito? O nandito na sila noon pa? Mukhang taga dito talaga sila pero sinimento sila sa gilid ng bangin para maiwasan ang pagguho ng lupa kapag malakas ang ulan.\n\nHabang mas lumalayo ako sa False, mas nagiging tahimik ang ilog. Kamangha-mangha kung paanong ang isang bagay na sobrang ingay at garalgal ay kagyat na nagiging tahimik at kalmado. Pero 'yan ang tubig—mabilis dumaloy, mabilis mag-iba.\n\n![Rocks](lilim/images/007/Mga-bato.jpeg)\n\nNagpatuloy ako sa paglakad sa tabi ng tahimik na tubig, sa ilalim ng tulay. Pakiramdam ko'y tinitignan ako ng mga taong lulan ng kani-kanilang sasakyan mula sa itaas. Para akong  hayop na nakatira sa natural kong tirahan at pinagmamasdan ng mga turista. Nagtago ako sa anino ng tulay nang hindi ako makita.\n\nTumango ako at nakita ang usok na nanggagaling mula sa kung saan. Hindi naman ito amoy inihaw. Siguro’y may nagsisiga lang. Pero bakit hindi ko rin naaamoy ang siga? Dinadalisay ba ng halipawpay ng ilog ang usok?\n\nNagsasalamin ang araw sa tubig. Kumikislap ang ilaw tulad ng patay-sinding bombilya.\n\nHabang nagpatuloy ako sa paglalakad, nagsimulang kumipot ang ilog at mas dumami ang mga bato. Dito nagliliparan ang maiitim na tutubi na may bughaw at berdeng batik. Kakaiba ang kanilang itsura. Para silang mga paru-paro. Mabagal pumagaspas ang kanilang mga pakpak. Parang mas mabigat ang mga ito kaysa kanilang katawan. Mga gamu-gamo silang mahahaba ang mga buntot.\n\nMayroon ding mga pulang tutubi—mga karayom ng diyablo! Kumikinang ang kanilang pagka-pula sa ilalim ng araw. Pinagmasdan ko ang isa habang nakakapit sa isang sanga ng kalbong halamang hindi ko kilala.\n\nPagkatapos ng kaunti pang paglalakad nagsimulang maging maingay muli ang tubig. Huh, falls ulit. Pero ngayon totoo na talaga siya. Hindi na semento ang dinadaluyan ng tubig. Mga batong kasinlaki ko na.\n\nMay nag-iisang halamang umusbong sa maliit na butas sa bato kung saan ako tumayo. Saan siya nanggaling? Saan siya patungo?\n\nHmmm.\n\nParang tanong ko rin yan sa sarili ko ah.\n\n![Sprouting plant from the rocks](lilim/images/007/Simit.jpeg)\n",

    "title": "The Only Thing We Can Truly Control",
    "content": "![Rom's backyard at Bae](lilim/images/008/Roms-backyard.jpeg)\n\nOne of the creepiest things I realized during my first ever meditation experience around 2015 to 2016 was being aware, for the first time, of the involuntary influx of thoughts in my mind.\n\nWith nothing to do but sit still with closed eyes, counting my breath one after the other, it became almost instantly obvious that focusing on this task was impossible.\n\nI think this realization was what hooked me to meditation. I have been counting my breath for about six years since, doing so almost every day, in the morning and the evening.\n\nIt is this same realization that draws other people to meditation. It is what wakes most of us from the slumber of mindlessness. It is the first blow to the illusion that we are in full control of our thoughts and our life in general.\n\nA single minute of meditation is enough to make us see through this illusion. Meditating shows us the fact that the majority of our thoughts are automatic. They come from an indecipherable source and arrive when we least expect them. They even come when we don’t want them to come. Creatives notice this a lot and many of us find it so difficult to take ownership of our own ideas and thoughts.\n\nMeditation makes this clear: We do not control the influx of thoughts in our mind.\n\nBut does this mean that we are forever at the mercy of our minds? Or is there something within our mental space that gives us a sense of control?\n\nWhile I realized that I do not control the influx of thoughts in my mind, I notice that I can actually control whether to pay attention to some thoughts or not. This is possible because there seems to be another persona within my mental space that simply watches the involuntary influx of thoughts. This persona is able to distance and even detach himself from the thoughts.\n\nThis persona that watches does not necessarily produces thoughts. I am not yet sure of that. But I am sure that he is good at one thing: paying attention. I am tempted to say that this persona is the real me. I am not my thoughts, I am that which watches my thoughts.\n\nThis persona that watches is the seat of control and free will. I think what is most important to realize from all these is this:\n\nThe only real thing we can control is our attention.\n\nWhat happens outside our minds—even our physical bodies—is ultimately outside of our control. What we have ultimate control of is there within our minds. But we can’t control the influx of thoughts in our mind. That leaves us with the watcher—it is the only thing we can truly control. Attention is our truest domain of freedom.\n\nAttention is therefore our ultimate battleground. If it is the only true domain of free will, the more important question to ask is:\n\nAre we protecting our attention from everything that could rob us of it?",

    "content": "![Freedom Park](lilim/images/009/Freedom-Park.jpeg)\n\nWriting by itself is simply communication.\n\nWhen I pick up pen and paper, I have ideas inside I want to bring out. In this process, I do two things:\n\n1\\. I express myself.\n\n2\\. I talk to someone.\n\nAlthough I do both of these things at the same time when I write, it is important to see their distinction especially when I want to be very intentional about how I communicate. When I am in express mode, I don’t try to edit myself. I just try to be as honest as possible. But when I shift to talk mode, that’s when I start to question how I first expressed my ideas. I become an editor trying to put myself in the shoes of the person I am trying to connect to. I want to make myself as clear as possible. But no matter what mode I am in, I am sure that I want one thing when I write: I want to be heard.\n\nAt the core of being a writer is wanting to be heard. That’s it. Writing is not about being published or getting an award. Those are nice to have. But they are not the point of writing. Writing is simply self-expression and communication, and in the middle of both of them is a psychological desire to be heard.\n\nAnd so every writer needs to ask themselves how much they want that need to be fulfilled. Yes, how much. This is a question of quantity.\n\nHow many people does a person need to be heard?\n\nFive? Ten? A hundred? A thousand? A million?\n\nWhat does it takes to feel seen, listened to, heard?\n\nThe reason why I believe this is important to ask oneself as a writer is that your answer to the question of quantity defines how much you are willing to sacrifice to finally feel heard. Because there is a difference—a huge difference— between expressing yourself to one person and expressing yourself to a thousand. In the latter, you stay in talk mode a bit longer, you tend to censor things you wanted to say but ought not to just because the stakes are higher.\n\nThe funny thing about this question of quantity is that if we really think of it, most of the time, we only need one person listening to us really well in order to feel that we are heard. And even a funnier thought is that that person can be oneself. We are made up of at least two people inside us, and we talk to him or her everytime. How we communicate with this person within us is far more important than how we communicate with the rest of the world. I strongly think that the best writers ever to walk this planet are writers who were able to listen and talk to that person within them most effectively.\n\nSo why do we need other people to feel heard? This is a question I am still pondering about. It is a question that also prompts me to doubt the very purpose of a platform such as this newsletter. Do I really need to send a missive to a handful of people every week to feel seen and heard?\n\nI don’t know. You tell me.\n\nPerhaps I will feel heard if you reply to this email and tell me your thoughts.",

It is used differently by different people, but the people who use the word almost always assume that everyone uses the word the same way and they aren't usually sensitive to this fact. For example, most Christians I talk to almost always equate spirituality to a reverence of a personified God. But there is a large collective of people who don't define God as a person and therefore could not find such a definition of spirituality useful.\n\nMy initial response to this problem is to use a different word altogether. [[jon kabat-zinn]] suggested that the word \"spiritual\" should be substituted by the word \"conscious\" to signify \"focused attention\" or mindfulness.\n\nThere is another way, of course, and that is to borrow the word BUT always be clear on how one defines it. I find it useful to equate spirituality with reverence towards something.\n\nFor example, feel reverence to things we hold \"sacred.\" We don't revere it and consider it worthy of our dedication unless we recognize its importance and significant to our life. I don't go to nature and write poems about it unless I feel first that I value it enough to hold it sacred. So spirituality I think is closest to what I feel when I feel in awe to the intelligibility and yet mystery of reality.",

    "title": "My second hike at Mt. Makiling to Aguila Base",
    "content": "\nNicco and I talked about pursuing dreams. He shared about his food business. He was a Grab driver before the pandemic. During the pandemic that obviously ended. He and his wife were forced to switch to food business: cheese cakes mainly but other stuff too. Business was going well at the beginning of the pandemic, but after the lockdowns eased up, sales dropped as people started going back to restaurants instead of eating at home. Food Panda drivers were affected as well. They moved from Lala Move to Food Panda when online food deliveries were such a trend at the start of the pandemic but went back to Lala Move after online food sales dropped. Nicco is currently selling insurance aside from selling food. But it is still a struggle.\n\nWe reached Aguila base. One can really see that the trail ends abruptly different. With the recent rains, the soil is really soft and muddy. While there, it was as if Mt. Makiling is making you feel afraid. The mountain is intensely canopied. There is not a single ridgeline. You are inside Makiling's world, under her enchantment, until you find your way back. There was a store at the base. Mami was served there, my companions told me. Now it is still closed.\n\nThere were hungry dogs. A mother who had surprisingly relatively healthy puppies approached us, wagging her tail, hoping to get some food. Another dog with lots of scabies, wounds open with some blood was roaming around us cautiously. Embi fed the dogs with all of his food. \"Di ko na kakainin ito. May pagkain naman tayo eh. Itong mga to wala talaga.\" Such a good man.\n\nWe made our way back and reached the mami store we passed by a while ago. We stopped and ate mami. The beef was good. The price was right. The noodles could've been better but the soup was enough for me to ignore the flaw. The soup had egg in it like lomi. It was thick. And the heat lasted longer. We ate under the open space, sky above us, no rain. It was good.\n\nDuring this walk, I learned that our feet remembers. They know where best to land. They are cautious. There are two parts to this hike: the hike on concrete road to Aguila base and the hike on muddy, slippery trail to mudspring. The experience of each are obviously startkingly different. I like walking on concrete or dirt roads when I want to practice a wide range of mindfulness. I switch from one view to the next, one sensation to the next. I am comfortable so I am more open to philosophizing, thinking, and being.\n\nWalking on muddy and slippery trails require focus. It transports you to your body and environment—immediate environment—sometimes, just the trail itself. Then there is an unusual relationship between your feet and the path that emerges. Everything else is shut down. Plants, twigs, leaves, and everything around us serves a utilitarian purpose. They are not objects to observe. They help you get past the trail. It is extremely immersive. You forget yourself. No walker, just walking. And you have no choice because your safety depends on it. I love both experiences.",

    "content": "\n## Where do your view on work and life complement one another?\n\nBoth [[My lifeview]] and [[My workview]] have this minimalist balanced view of money that recognizes the need for it but only in a limited role—a supportive role. What is more important are the things that occur in the gift space especially those related to my vocation.\n\nI realized that I have never truly been driven by money. I have been very cheap in my life and could be even cheaper if needed. The more I don't think about how I can generate more income, the better. And this is why I am attracted to a patronage.\n\nBecause the main work is inner and its movement is slow, fame is not really part of the equation. I actually don't want to be a bestselling author, a producer of words. What I want to be is to become a producer of goodness and compassion and help in alleviating suffering. This means the work I want to do is not only creative. It involves working with people directly—one on one.\n\n## Where to they clash?\n\nThe only contradiction I see that I am hoping to correct soon is the compartmentalization of everything. Since livelihood work will still be a prominent part of my life, ideally, it has to be treated as integral. Either I force myself to really put my heart into it and love it or I look for a different job—one that is closer to passion and therefore closer to love.\n1. Day Job\n2. Business that integrates with my vocation.\n3. Vocation\n\n## Does one drive the other How?\n\nMy lifeview should definitely drive my workview. Because I am interestingly existential, I am called to do contemplative, pihilosophical, and pastoral work. If i was Catholic, I defnitely went to priesthood. If I was religious, I would have become a pastor. My calling is to construct my own worldview, be in the world, and see how any of them could be of help to others. Livelihood is there to support this calling financially.",

    "content": "\n# Module #2: Rapid Email Frameworks (How to Write Persuasive Emails Fast)\n\nEmails that you only send once in an email sequence.\n\n30 minutes writing and 10-20 minutes editing\nWrite fast by having:\n- Research\n- Frameworks that work (these boosts your confidence that your emails will deliver)\n\nBefore writing you must already have done the research about\n- who you are writing the emails to (their fears, desires, needs, beliefs, identifications)\n- why it's beneficial for them to buy and buy now (features, benefits, USP, elevator pitch, value proposition)\n- why they should pick you over the competition (research competitor's promises, sales messages, guarantees, etc.)\n\n## Killer email elements\n\n1. Subject line\n2. Opening sentence (pattern interrupt)\n3. The body\n4. They segue\n5. The ask\n\nOnly 4 elements in the frameworks\n\n## 1. What, Not How\n\n- Tell them what the problem is.\n\t- Educate if needed.\n- Tell them what to do to solve it.\n\t- Give them a step-by-step if needed.\n- Tease or hint that the true solution is in the product or just by clicking the link.\n\t- That's where the how is\n\nWhy it works\n- You are demonstrating expertise, insight\n- You are solving their problem\n- You are helping them get closer to their dreams\n\n## 2. Troll/Hater Email\n\n- You can use someone who trolled you or the trolls of someone you are following.\n- First line: use a climactic first line that grabs your attention.\n\t-  I finally got my first hater\n\t- Someone trolled me the other day\n\t- This is my first troll this week\n- Give context\n\t- Show what they said by posting the question or a screenshot (blur the name)\n- Give commentary or answer the troll: Why he's wrong, right. What makes him wrong or right.\n- Commend the right. Expose the wrong. (Point everything or just one thing)\n- If you'd like to learn more (the real way, the fast way, a more ethical way). To do this, then go here and get [product].\n\nWhy it works\n- People like drama and story and conflict\n- This filters people who are not meant to be your audience\n\n## 3. How to X without Y even if Z\n\n- If you're trying to (blank), then here are a few things I've discovered that (blank).\n- List each one and briefly explain what and why, not how.\n- Want to know a simple way to make all these things happen at once?\n- Get my product.\n- CTA\n\nWhy it works\n- It's a teaser to the real product.\n\n## 4. Here's Why, Not How\n\n- I saw something the other day OR I heard this ridiculous thing OR I realized something OR tell them something that troubled you\n- Here's WHY that's a problem/Why you think that happened\n- Tell them the point/moral/lesson\n- Link to the product\n- CTA\n\nWhy it works\n- Good for daily emails or broadcast emails\n- It's topical and relevant\n- It's insightful because it came from you (if they are in your list, share something personal because they want to know something about you)\n\n## 5. Poralizing\n\n- Use this if you have a contrarian view against a popular or prevailing statement\n- Format\n\t- People are going to hate me for saying this, but I'm going to say it anyway\n\t- Controversial statement\n\t- Defend (Here's why)\n\t- Link to product\n\t- CTA\n\n## 6. Correlation\n\n- Explain a topic your prospects already understand or explain it quickly in a way that makes it easy to understand.\n\t- Sports, politics, religion, etc.\n\t- Or find something in your living room or office and connect it to a feature of the product you are selling.\n- How does this topic relate to the market's problems and solutions?\n- Create a correlation to check your product.\n- Give them a \"push\" to take action.\n\n## 7. News email\n\n- Similar to correlation emails but topic 1 is the news.\n- Format:\n\t- I saw this news the other day.\n\t- Here's what happened.\n\t- It reminds me/It's kinda like/The reason this matters because\n\t- State the point\n\t- Segue to your product\n\t- CTA\n\nWhy it works\n- It's topical\n- You connect it with your product\n\n## 8. Situation, Problem, Implication, Next (SPIN)\n\n- From Ray Edwards\n- Format\n\t- Are you in this situation right now? And you want to go from here to here?\n\t- Here are the common problems to from A-Z\n\t- Imply the work involved.\n\t\t- You spent money, time, and effort.\n\t\t- You did a lot of \"leg work\" to find what works.\n\t- There is a shortcut!\n\t\t- It's called [unique mechanism] and this is why this shortcut works.\n\t- What's it? Here's what you need to do next.\n\n\n## 9. Goal, Realistic, Overview, What's Next (GROW)\n\n- This is your goal, right? You want X, Y, and Z without A, B, C.\n\t- Ex: Do you want to become a $10k/mo copywriter?\n- Here are the realistic things you can do to achieve goal\n- Overview of the steps to get there\n- What's next?\n\t- If you want to get that WITHOUT doing all three or want to get it faster, join my program.\n- The tone of this framework is like a friend that is wise.\n\nWhy it works:\n- Shows that you emphatize.\n- \n\n## Welcome email\n\nmost opened email (80%)\n\nFramework 1\n- fulfills original promise from opt in\n- presents expectations (tell everything)\n- tells who to unsubscribe\n- builds curiosity for future emails (normally a bullet)\n- introduces personality, beliefs, and methods (introduce yourself)\n- polarizes (what you stand against, what you hate)\n- provide cliffhanger (e.g., on my second email, I am going to show you how to create a...)\n- sign off\n\nFramework 2 (polarizing; useful in a sophisticated niche like fitness)\n- Call them out as different and congratulate them on making the choice to improve their life (trigger belonging and the cognitive bias of being congratulated from past decisions)\n- Invalidate other solutions and make them the enemy (e.g., I'm not like other blank who blank)\n- Tell them you'll be sharing something you've never shared before\n- Tell what to expect (bullets)\n- Tell them the free stuff is better than other paid stuff and that they need to take action (or in the past you will pay for this but I am giving it now for free; )\n- Fulfill promise from opt-in\n- Tell them who should unsubscribe. (This is important to save your client money)\n\n# References",

Deepen my knowledge of English. Take IELTS? Get a masters degree.\n\nWith copywriting, I have a sure job with Lea.

By nature, I want to communicate more freely and to let go of rules as much as possible.\n\nIf my dayjob is writing instead of editing, then I will be forced to get better at writing even if that is copywriting.\n\n## How to build an editing business\n\nThere are three projects:\n1. Establish a safety net (an editing agency that does the marketing).\n2. Establish a clientelle via a freelancing platform like Upwork.\n3. Establish a clientelle using your own editing website.\n\nThe projects must be pursued in this order.\n\nOnce project 1 is achieved, I want to spend at least one month doing an ultra-learning project to improve my editing skills with a hands-on application at my new safety net.\n\nAn alternative to establishing a clientelle in Upwork is to find a second editing agency.\n\nThe third project involves integrating services that are closer to what you are really passionate about like writing coach or developmental editing.\n\n## Editing companies acepting applications\n\nhttps://gatheringdreams.com/proofreading-jobs/\n\n- [Scribbr](https://www.scribbr.com/freelance-native-english-editor/)\n- [PaperTrue](https://blog.papertrue.com/hiring-freelance-editors/)\n- Cambridge Proofreading\n- [Eleven Writing](https://www.elevenwriting.com/job/editor)\n- [Jobs for Editor](https://jobsforeditors.com/)\n- First Editing\n- [Proofreading Services](https://www.proofreadingservices.com/pages/careers)",

On this part of the path the walker would've also felt nostalgic. He would've pondered about who may have walked here hundred years before him, what he was thinking. Would that third walker be as curious as us. Or would the walker be a woman running away from the village into this one big tree, grieving the freedom she just lost from a marriage with a man she doesn't love.",

Improve website design and development skills.\n2. Improve photography skills (including strategies for talking to strangers and asking to take portraits).\n3. Buy audio recorder and practice recording binaural sounds.\n4. Practice taking videos using your camera.\n5. Choose and set routes for the walk.\n6. Set rules for the walk.\n7. Read history of LB from secondary sources.\n8. Read history of LB from primary sources.\n9. Research historical information on Tadlak lake, bath houses, Dampalit falls, Orient buko pie, Makiling.\n10. Set up newsletter.\n11. Invite people to sign up to the  newsletter.\n12. Do the walk.\n13. Write the first manuscript.\n14. Edit the first manuscript.\n15. Find readers and send the first manuscript to them for feedback.\n16. Do revisions based on feedback.\n17. Do more reserch and re-walks if necessary.\n18. Do a photo cull.\n19. Edit photos.\n20. Include photos in the second manuscript.\n21. Send second manuscript with photos to readers.\n22. Do revisions.\n23. Design book cover.\n24. Get a proof copy.\n25. Finalize.\n26. Launch.\n\nSet time limit for each.\n\n# Ideas\n\n- Walk predetermined routes that cover all major walking areas in Los Baños in seven days.\n- Walk, take photos, and talk to strangers in the morning and afternoon then write, edit photos, and publish missives in the evening.\n- The walk should happen within January to March.\n- Discover new eskinitas or kalyehons.\n- Consider doing a crowdfunding campaign.\n- Ask a friend about UP's renting process for teachers etc. (Maybe Kate?)\n- For the book, use Thoreau's way: universal then local then individual\n\t- Who would have thought that I would be in LB at this time?\n\t- Existential description.\n\t- Then describe LB.\n\t- Then describe this specific part of the walk.\n\t- My walk is befriending life and place and finding home.\n- My book is a map of Los Baños in story form.\n- Walking as world building and worldview building; physical space influences mental space; what comes out is a life\n\n# Words\n\nThese walks are meant to be rewalked.\nThese words are maps of these places in story-form.\nWhen words are not enough, images take their place.\n\n# Initial routes\n\n1. Lalakay (start around Linda's Garden)—Tadlak Lake: Main road, resords, Tadlak lake\n2. Dampalit Falls—Dampalit Creek—Bambang Road—Bayan—Malinta—Santo Domingo: Dampalit and Laguna de Bay route\n3. Jamboree Road—Timugan—Anos: Contrast of nature and industry, buko pies, pasalubong\n4. Eskinitas of Mayondon, Bayog, San Antonio, Batong Malake\n5. Maahas—UPOU—IPB road—Tuntungin\n6. UPLB\n7. Makiling\n\nHow about Makiling Botanics?\n\n# Method\n- Read natural history of the place.\n- Read local history of the palce.\n- Walk: Be present, take photos, philosophize, and converse when the right opportunity comes; follow the rules of the walk\n\nPerhaps Marvin was right. Let the data dictate how the book will be.\nInstead of exact geolocation coordinates, just say Pili Drive or the name of the street or place. Remember Elio's essay.\n\n# Rules of the walk\n\n- I need to be alone.\n- Choose a short book readable in one week, divide the book in seven parts, and read one part in the evening before the walk.\n- Start in the morning and could extend in the afternoon.\n- Take at least one portrait photo.\n- Talk to at least one stranger.\n- Record binaural audio.\n- Record one video.\n- Write and publish a missive in the evening including some edited photos.\n\n# To dos\n\n- Research: Who is Janges?\n- Read history of UPLB book.\n- Research: What are the different ways to frame a walking book? Perform a review of literature.",

I have assisted her in implementing it, gathered feedback from her use of it, and redesigned it based on these feedback.\n\nMeasurements of success\n1. LMS\n\t1. Lea should have freed up time and mental space that she can dedicate for other endeavors.\n\t2. Lea should be able to engage in a specific task with as much focus as possible.\n\t3. Lea should have articulated her goals, created a plan for achieving those goals, and reviewed their results diligently for feedback.\n2. OBMS\n\t1. Lea should have freed up time and mental space that she can use to accomodate at least one more premium client.\n\t2. Lea should have a system in place to scout, hire, and train at least one additional hand to help her in doing her work.\n\n## Lea's current implementation of an LMS\n\n- She already has a capturing habit established.\n- She captures most of her ideas and todos in her analog journal and Google Keep.\n- She uses Todoist only when she needs to buy stuff in the grocery.\n- When overwhelmed with the amount of information and todos, she turns to her jounal, does a brain dump, and write a todo list there.\n- She subscribes to a lot of newsletters but does not process them (i.e., does not open them). When she needs inspiration, she searches for emails. (Solution: Set a filter that directs newsletter emails to a specific label so they don't cloud her inbox.)\n\n\nTo dos\n\nLMS\n\n1. Set up a MV LMS prototype.\n2. Coach her in establishing and implementing the daily, weekly, and monthly habits and routines needed to keep the LMS running.\n3. Collect regular feedback (at least weekly) from her implementation of the system.\n4. Use the feedback to make major and minor changes to the design.\n5. Support her for at least six months to one year until she can stand on her own.\n\nOBMS\n\nThe OBMS will follow the same steps. In fact, it will be integrated (although, later) in the LMS. It will be considered as a new project. Systems can be established but the habits to run the system should only come later.\n\nProjects\n- Purging digital spaces\n- Transitioning to new laptop\n- Setting up a back up system\n- Set up a digital privacy and protection system\n\n- Youtube channel\n- Backdrop\n- Business registration\n- Habits\n- Systems\n- Hiring\n\n1-2 months run systems then decide whether we can build a team or hire new client\n\nSome realizations\n\n- If I am going to offer this as a service, there has to be an option to hire me as a retainer at least for 6 months to one year.",

Currently, my primary source of income is a day job I love. But, I am slowly building a passion business that will eventually replace this day job. Aside from this, I am helping Lea manage and improve her biz, which provides additional income.\n\nI spend most of my days engaged in activities that are most important to me: writing, philosophizing, contemplating, walking, photography, and poetry. I enjoy ample creative freedom because my finances are secure and intact. \n\nBecause of this security and abundance, I finally launched a book project about walking at Los Baños. I did a seven-day walk which I documented through a newsletter series. The material I collected from that walk is what I am now turning into a book. I am on the project's finishing touches, and I look forward to launching it in the first quarter of next year. Its launch is made possible because of a successful crowdfunding campaign. I have exceeded my goal of funding the publication of at least 100 copies and the earnings I will get from these orders will be able to fund the next book project.\n\nThe book project mustered my confidence and motivation to seriously improve my web design and development, photography, writing, and connecting skills. I am now quite adept in understanding design principles, and I have applied that understanding in designing a digital garden website that houses all the shareable artifacts of my creativity according to how I want them to appear and be organized. I have mastered using the Canon Mark II and have improved my capturing and editing skills. Daily practice, courses, and feedback have also improved my writing. Through the book project, I have learned how to approach people, ask for guidance, and interview or greet strangers in my walks.\n\nI have also connected with mentors doing work I wanted to do. I have interviewed them about their stories. Through their help, I gained clarity on my life design. They have also provided me with valuable resources and have connected me with other mentors and peers who help me with my dreams and goals. Some of these people have been close friends who I slowly welcome into my inner circle. I regularly converse with self-directed and autonomous creatives, thinkers, and contemplatives deeply grounded in their aspirations to live a good life and share their stories beautifully. I have established a regular habit of searching and reaching out to these people regularly.\n\nI can achieve all these in no small part because I have cared for myself. I have followed a daily routine that encourages good writing and thinking. I sleep eight hours a day, keep my intermittent fasting routine, and have only one heavy meal a day (lunch). I only eat smoothies at night. I have reduced my sugar and carbs intake and increased my diet's veggies, fruits, and fermented foods. I also have regular days of exercise every week and can manage my stress well through mindfulness and contemplative practices like walking. I learned to avoid stressors as much as possible and live a relaxed and calm life. I have improved my self-confidence by only wearing clothes that make me feel good about myself. And most importantly, I live in a home and environment that encourages contemplation and creativity. I could also start tapering my antidepressant to 1/4 a pill daily.\n\n### Summary of Knowns and Unknowns\n\n| Areas     | Knowns                 | Unknowns                                                                            | Best Guess |\n| --------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |\n| Location  | Los Baños              |                                                                                     |            |\n| Finances  | Prioritize establishing a consistent source of income through academic writing.

This includes journaling, note-writing in my [[Talahardin]], writing field notes, and the writing I do during [[Review]].\n- I prioritize content over style ([[Thoreau prioritized content over style in his writing]]). [[The technicalities of your craft could cloud your real purpose]]. I don't want that to happen in my writing. I want to focus on the search for truth, and I don't want to force insight ([[Insight cannot be predetermined]]). This implies that I will intentionally choose to lessen my publication, perhaps to just once or twice a month (one Lilim and one Uman or just one Uman alone). This will allow me to focus on improving my journal entries, Talahardin, and field notes.\n- Avoid making premature conclusions in your public writing. If you are not yet sure about what certain things mean to you or what course of action to take, say it honestly. Do not feel pressure to produce and write answers when the answers are just not there. Writing with an emphasis on process rather than product, which necessitates lesser publication, should solve this.\n- I still want to write romantic excursions. However, I want intimate philosophy to be my primary lens. I need to reevaluate the kind of walks I want to take as they relate to the kind of writing and books I want to produce.\n- Improve my sleep.\n- Improve my diet.\n- Continue practicing submitting works to different publications.\n\n## Reading\n\n[[My ABC books]]\n[[My reading list]]\n\n## Community\n\n- Start a writer's group, where writers could receive and provide feedback.\n\n## Related\n- [[Questions about nature writing]]\n- [[Some feedback on my writing]]\n- [[How to improve writing through ultralearning]]",

I can make better decisions regarding the website if there are progress in the other parts.\n***\n\n# What to do with Rem's sites\n\nRem has 11 wordpress sites under the account with the email rmtanauan@hotmail.com.\n\n1. Ginhawa sampler site\n2. Ipabasa\n3. Sample service\n4. Peregrinations Within\n5. Rem Tanauan\n6. Story Commune\n7. Story Sharing Design\n8. The Corporate Misfit\n9. Pathfinder's Commune\n10. Iching.ph\n11. Tungko ng Tula\n\n## A. On the free sites\n\nSites 1-8 are free sites. I have already backed up all of them except Story Commune which has no content at all. Since their content is backed up, they can be repurposed if needed. The decision to be made for them is what to do with them.\n\nThe following seems to have been unlaunched and unfinished projects or experimental sites. They only have a few pages and almost no posts.\n\n- Ginhawa sampler site\n- Ipabasa\n- Sample service\n- Rem Tanauan\n- Story Commune (totally no content)\n- Story Sharing Design\n\nMeanwhile, the following projects seem to have been launched but were abandoned for a long time already.\n\n- Peregrinations Within (abandoned since 2014)\n- The Corporate Misfit (abandoned since 2015)\n\nPeregrinations Within (travel blog) only has four posts. The Corporate Misfit doesn't seem to be Rem's blog. Its author is Irish Movido. But for some reason, it is within Rem's account. It has several posts from 2014-2015.\n\nAll sites were abandoned and are no longer attracting new visitors. In short, they are not doing anything to advance Rem's work and legacy. With this in mind, what should be done with them?\n\n**Options**\n\n1. Keep all. Nothing changes. Since they are free, you won't incur any expenses. But, like I said, they don't have any real function other than reminder's of Rem's digital footprints.\n2. Delete all. Since they are all already backed up, you have all the content in case you want to repurpose them. Deleting them will declutter Rem's digital footprint. (In case of The Corporate Misfit of Irish Movido, we can give her a backup of her site in case she wants a copy.)\n3. Delete all but republish the best posts into a new live site (like the proposed RemTanauan.com). For example, the blog posts in Peregrinations Within can be republished as samples of Rem's travel writings.\n\n**My suggestion**\n\nI suggest option 3. Deleting the unfinished and abandoned sites ensures that we can repurpose or even completely reuse the content in better websites we will build. It will make maintaining Rem's sites easier and will make Rem's brand cleaner.\n\n## B. Paid sites\n\nThe following sites have current active plans that will be renewed and incur money unless we intervene.\n\n- Pathfinder's Commune\n- Iching.ph\n- Tungko ng Tula\n\n### Pathfinder's Commune\n\nPC will auto-renew on April 26, 2023. So we still have around 6 months to decide what to do with it. When renewed, it will incur USD 18 (about Php 1,000 ) per year.\n\n### Iching.ph\n\nIching.ph will auto-renew on September 18, 2023. So we still have about 11 months to decide what to do with it. When renewed, it will incur Php 2,400 per year.\n\nIt is still attracting visitors. Therefore, it can still potentially be a platform to continue Rem's vision and legacy particularly in I Ching.\n\nWhat will we do with it?\n\nOptions\n1. Keep it. And do not change anything. You will continue to host the site in Wordpress.com. You will continue to pay Php 2,400 per year and the site will not be updated. Its traffic and permalinks will be preserved. It will serve as an artifact of Rem's work but could continue to serve as a valuable resource for people interested in I Ching. This is the easiest option as we will do almost nothing other than simply pay to keep the site running.\n2. Keep it. But make some changes. Like option one, the site stays in Wordpress.com and will cost the same amount (Php 2,400). It preserves the site's traffic and permalinks. But we can update the site to repurpose it. That said, since it is hosted in Wordpress.com, there will be limits in its design and development. This is an easy option too with the only added work of someone updating the site regularly.\n3. Keep it. Make changes. And self-host it in Wordpress.org. This gives us more freedom to design and develop it but it will cost more. We will transfer the domain name to a new registrar (might cost about Php 1000+). Then we purchase hosting plan (about Php 6,000 for 3 years). To save on hosting, we could host it in the same account that Tungko ng Tula uses. Since it uses Wordpress, the site can be maintained by more people in a relatively easier manner.\n4. Keep it. Make changes. And self-host it as a static site in Github. This gives us more freedom to design and develop it. We will still pay about Php 1000+ to transfer the domain and will continue to pay this every year, but hosting is free. Using this method, we can also incorporate Rem's I Ching notes from his Obsidian to add more resources to learning I Ching. That said, this method requires more coding skills so we need to train others who will help maintain the site.\n5. Keep the IChing.ph domain but transfer the content of the site to RemTanauan.com. In this option, we transfer the domain to a new registrar and just hold it there until someone (a student of Rem) would like to claim it. All the contents of the site will then be repurposed to RemTanauan.com. The problem with this method is that it could potentially lose some traffic the the site has built and the permalinks can be destoryed. To avoid this, we will have to do some permalink redirections, which might require a lot of work.\n6. Let go of the domain name but transfer the content of the site to RemTanauan.com. Same as Option 5, only that you lose the domain name completely.\n\n**My suggestion**\n\nAs much as I would like to incorporate Rem's I Ching writings in his main site RemTanauan.com, I want to preserve the permalinks and traffic he has already built. Because that will ensure that his work will continue to be useful for others. My suggestion is to keep the domain name and to continue to use it to house Rem's I Ching legacy.\n\nHowever, we have to decide what to do with the site while the plan is active until September 2023 and after that. My suggestion is to assign someone who is deeply interested in Rem's work with I Ching and let him/her manage and update the site, collating everything Rem has written on I Ching into it. Depending on his/her technological skills, she can either manage it in Wordpress.com, Wordpress.org, or Github.\n\nIf he/she decides to host it in Wordpress.org, we tranfer the site to the same hosting account as Tungko ng Tula for easier managing. The decision has to be made who pays for the hosting and domain name: the person who maintains or Rem's legacy fund?\n\n(Note: Now that I am thinking about it, we might really need to raise funds to maintain Rem's websites for years to come.)\n\nCREATE A COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL FOR TAKING CARE OF REM'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES\n\n",

    "title": "Rationalism vs. Empiricism",
    "content": "\nWhat is the extent to which we are dependent upon experience in gaining knowledge of the external world?\n\nExperience has two kinds:\n\n1. Sense experience - five senses; acquires knowledge of external objects\n2. Reflective experience - includes conscious awareness of our mental operations; acquires knowledge of our minds\n\nThe distinction between sense and reflective experience is often neglected in the rationalism vs. empiricism dispute.\n\nRationalists criticize empiricists for claiming that all ideas originate from sense experience.\n\nRationalists claim that we can gain knowledge independent of sense experience.\n\nRationalists do not have to believe that knowledge is acquired independent of any experience. For one, rationalists believe that reflective experience (i.e., conscious awareness of thought) is necessary for reasoning.\n\nRationalists develop their view in two steps:\n\n1. There are cases where the content of our concepts or knowledge outstrips the information that sense experience can provide.\n2. Reason provides additional information about the external world.\n\nEmpiricists develop their view in two steps:\n\n1. Experience alone provides the information that rationalists cite because we have it in the first place.\n2. Reflective understanding can and usually supplies the missing links in our concepts or knowledge.\n- For example, Locke's said that the idea of substance is a composite idea that incorporates both sensation and reflection.\n\nAlmost no author is a pure rationalist or a pure empiricist.\n\n- For example, although Descartes is a hardcore rationalist in metaphysics, he was empiricist in natural philosophy, where sense experience plays a curcial role.\n- Locke, although an empiricist, argued that reason is as important as experience when it comes to knowledge of moral truths.\n\nRationalism vs. empiricism is an epistemological issue.\n\nKnowledge is divided into three categories:\n\n1. Knowledge of the external world\n2. Knowledge of the internal world or self-knowledge\n3. Knowledge of moral and/or aesthetical values\n\nSome defining questions of epistemology related to the rationalism vs. empiricism dispute are the following:\n\n1. What is the nature of propositional knowledge, knowledge that a particular proposition about the world, ourselves, morality, or beauty is true?\n- To know a proposition it must be true and warranted (which means it is not a lucky guess).\n2. How can we gain knowledge?\n- We can make lucky guesses or warranted beliefs. We must be able to think about the object of our knowledge. How do we gain our concepts? Is the way we divide the world in concepts accurate?\n3. What are the limits of our knowledge?\n- We could think about some things but not have knowledge about them (e.g., competing descriptions about a certain thing, make us not know what to believe in).\n- Some things may be beyond the limits of thought. We cannot form intelligible descriptions of them. Even if we make an intelligible description, we cannot know if it is true. A very good example of this will be the platonic realm.\n\nRationalism vs. empiricism is primarily about the sources of our concepts and knowledge. But it can incorporate the nature of warrant and the limits of thought and knowledge.\n\nHow can we gain knowledge?\n\nThere are three main theses:\n\n1. Intuition/Deduction Thesis\n2. Innate Knowledge Thesis\n3. Innate Concept Thesis\n\nIntuition/Deduction Thesis: \"Some propositions in a particular subject area, S, are knowable by us by intuition alone; still others are knowable by being deduced from intuited propositions.\"\n\nWe can generate different versions of the Intuition/Deduction thesis by substituting different subject areas for the variable ‘S’.\n\nThis has been traditionally seen as what distinguished rationalism from empiricism. However, rationalists and empiricists now agree with this thesis.\n\nIntuition\n\n- A form of direct, immediate insight.\n- An internal perception\n- We intellectually grasp a proposition and just “see” it to be true, forming a true, warranted belief in it. However, the nature of this \"seeing\" needs explanation.\n\nDeduction\n\n- A process in which we derive conclusions from intuited premises through valid arguments, ones in which the conclusion must be true if the premises are true.\n\nIntuition and deduction provide us with knowledge that is independent, for its justification, of experience. This is called “a priori” knowledge.\n\nInnate Knowledge Thesis: \"We have knowledge of some truths in a particular subject area, S, as part of our nature.\"\n\nWe get different versions of the Innate Knowledge thesis by substituting different subject areas for the variable ‘S’.\n\nAccording to this thesis, there are certain knowledge that comes from our nature. We are born with it. Its justificiation does not depend on experience or intuition/deduction. Experiences could bring these knowledge to consciousness but not provide the knowledge themselves. We may have gained this knowledge from an earlier existence, from God, or through natural selection.\n\nEmpiricists reject the innate knowledge thesis. According to them, even if such knowledge existed, it would be little use to us.\n\nInnate Concept Thesis: We have some of the concepts we employ in a particular subject area, S, as part of our rational nature.\n\nAccording to this thesis, sense experiences may trigger a process that brings these concepts to our concsiousness, but experience do not provide the concepts or the information they contain. The concepts are part of our rational nature.\n\nSome believe that the Innate Concept thesis is entailed by the Innate Knwledge thesis: knowledge can only be innate if the concepts in the proposition are also innate.\n\nThe more a concept is removed from experience and mental operations we can perforn on experience, the more plausibly that it is innate. For example, we do not exprience a triangle, so our concept of it is more innate. On the other hand, we experience pain. So our conceot of it is less innate.\n\nThe Intuition/Deduction thesis, the Innate Knowledge thesis, and the Innate Concept thesis are essential to rationalism.\n\nTo be a rationalist is to adopt at least one of them: either the Innate Knowledge thesis, regarding our presumed propositional innate knowledge, or the Innate Concept thesis, regarding our supposed innate knowledge of concepts.\n\nRationalists vary the strength of their view by adjusting their understanding of warrant.\n\n1. Warranted beliefs are absolute truths and intution provides them.\n2. Warranted beliefs are beyond reasonable doubt and intution provides them.\n\nSome ratonalists believe that intuition is infallible. Others believe intuition can be false.\n\nTwo theses are generaly adopted by rationalists (but you can still be a rationalist without believing them):\n\n1. The Indespensability of Reason Thesis: The knowledge we gain in subject area, S, by intuition and deduction, as well as the ideas and instances of knowledge in S that are innate to us, could not have been gained by us through sense experience. → Sense experience cannot provide what we gain from reason.\n2. The Superiority of Reason Thesis: The knowledge we gain in subject area S by intuition and deduction or have innately is superior to any knowledge gained by sense experience.\n\nHow is reason superior to experience?\n\n1. What we know *by intuition* is certain, beyond even the slightest doubt, while what we believe, or even know, on the basis of sense experience is at least somewhat uncertain.\n2. What we know by reason alone is superior in an important metaphysical way to what we are aware of through sense experience.\n\nSome commitments that rationalists make:\n\n1. Some rationalists are committed to denying scepticism on truths they know by intuition, deduction, or innate knowledge.\n2. Rationalists who believe in the Intuition/Deduction thesis are also committed to epistemic foundationalism—the belief that certain truths are absolute and we can use them as foundational knowledge to know more truths (this is Steve Patterson’s belief).\n\nEmpiricists also believe in the Intuition/Deduction thesis but they only on the contents of our mind and not empirical facts from the external world.\n\nEmpiricists reject the Innate Knowledge and Innate Concept theses.\n\nEmpiricists believe that all knowledge are gained, not just triggered, by sensorial or reflective experience.\n\nExperience is our only source of ideas.\n\nEmpiricists reject the Superiority of Reason thesis. Since reason alone cannot give us knowledge, it certainly does not give us superior knowledge.\n\nEmpiricists need not reject the Indispensability of Reason thesis, but most of them do.\n\n*The Empiricism Thesis*: We have no source of knowledge in S or for the concepts we use in S other than experience.\n\nThe Empiricism Thesis does not entail that we have empirical knowledge  but that we can only gain knowledge by experience.\n\n**The basic claims of rationalism and empiricism are relative to a particular subject area. This means that rationalism and empiricism, when relativized, need not conflict.**\n\n**Rationalism and empiricism only conflict when formulated to cover the same subject.**\n\nThe distinction between rationalism and empiricism does not mean that there are no longer other sources of knowledge. We can be either a rationalist and empiricist yet still believe that knowledge in a particular area can come from Divine revelation, which is not a product of either reason or sense experience.\n\nWe have to be careful of the rationalist and empiricist labels because using them the wrong way could impede our understanding.\n\nThis distinction, initially applied by Kant, is responsible for giving us a very restrictive philosophical canon, which does not take into account developments in the philosophy of emotions, philosophy of education, and even disputes in areas of philosophy considered more mainstream, like ethics and aesthetics.\n\n**Unless restricted to debates regarding the possibility of innate knowledge, this distinction is best left unused.**\n\nThe best debate between rationalism and empiricism is about truths about the external world.\n\nThe rationalist position about knowledge of the external world is that some are and must be innate and that this knowledge is superior to any that sense experience could ever provide.\n\nThe empiricist position about knowledge of the external world is that experience is their sole source. Reason can inform us about the relations among truths about the external world, but those truths can only be gained through experience.\n\nHistorically, the rationalist/empiricist dispute in epistemology has extended into the area of metaphysics.\n\nSome rationalists present metaphysical theories, which they claim to have known by intuition and/or deduction alone. Empiricists reject these theories as speculation beyond what we can learn from experience, or nonsensical attempts to describe aspects of the world beyond the concepts experience can provide.\n\nThe rationalist-empiricist debate even questions the very need for metaphysics. Metaphysics can only be an area of human knowledge through a resolution of the rationalist and empiricist debate.\n\n# References\n\nMarkie, P., \u0026 Folescu, M. (2021). Rationalism vs. Empiricism.

    "content": "\n![Misty Mountain](misty-mountain.jpg)\n\nIf you look deep enough, you'll realize there's no clear distinction between the disciplines of science, philosophy, and poetry, other than, perhaps, their histories, traditions, and methodologies. But even their histories are filled with people who were both poets and scientists, poets and philosophers, scientists and philosophers.\n\nAll of these disciplines are invested on this one project of \"seeing the world clearly.\"\n\nI have always felt it true what Thoreau said:\n\n\u003e The poet uses the results of science and philosophy, and generalizes their wildest deductions.\n\nPoetry does not only refer to the writing of poems. It also pertains to writing, speaking, presenting anything, and dare I say living, in a poetic way. No doubt, science and philosophy, with all their serious language, could largely benefit from a poet's tongue—a tongue which speaks a language that sounds more alluring, more down-to-earth, and yet as profound.\n\nOn the other hand, the poet is also reinforced by a knowledge of science and philosophy, because he is as interested to truth as he is to beauty. Truth is about **_\"what is really there\"_** not **_\"what should be there\"_**. Seeing **_\"what is really there\"_** is honest work, a beautiful work, a useful work—a work that scientists and philosophers are trained to do. And it is work that a true poet should also be interested to, as many poets of old have been: Empedocles, Rumi, Robert Frost, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Miguel de Unamuno, Paul Valéry, [and the list goes on and on](http://philosopherpoets.com/).\n\nPoetry is driven by a desire to see things clearly and to [[Doing Afternoon Fieldworks|report]] what one sees (and experiences) in the most beautiful way—in a way that the poet hopes could benefit others as well as himself.\n\nIt's a noble vocation worthy to be pursued by all thinking human beings—not just by scientists, philosophers, and yes, poets.\n",

This [[thoughts/my forest garden of the mind|digital garden]] tracks my footprints—both in the [[wilderness of the mind]] and the [[wilderness of geographic space]]. I use the word \"footprints\" here as inspired by a quote from [[Herbert Fingarette]]:\n\n\u003e\"These studies are outcomes rather than realised objectives. In making the journey, I have no aims. These studies are intellectual footprints, not blueprints.\"\n\nWhile I recognize my tendency to be allured to blueprints I do my best to resist them and maintain an openness to knowledge and the larger world where knowledge arise. This commitment necessitates that I give myself the permission to change my beliefs as [[the long walk]] unravels.\n\nAs common among digital gardeners, I use botanical language in organizing my work. [[thoughts/my forest garden of the mind|My forest garden of the mind]] is what I refer to the this collection of writings. This is what I walk and tend to every day.\n\nThe forest garden is made up of different \"species\" of thought:\n- [[essays]]\n- [[poems]]\n- [[quotes]]\n- [[thoughts]]\n- [[translations]]\n- [[vignettes]]\n\nThese species will grow in number as I see fit.\n\nSpecies are further classified depending on level of development: [[seeds]], [[seedlings]], and [[evergreens]].\n\n[Seeds](tags/seeds) are random ephemeral thoughts that come to me during walks or throughout the day. Seeds are kept as is based on the perspective of [[thoughts/henry david thoreau|Henry David Thoreau]] and [[thoughts/henry bugbee|Henry Bugbee]] that insights as pure as they are have relevance and their purity needs to be maintained.\n\n[Seedlings](tags/seedlings) are planted seeds that will be revisited and changed in a constant basis and edited intermittently until they reach a more permanent form: evergreens.\n\n[Evergreens](tags/evergreens) are works that don't change that much. They are finished products, shareable and, in case of thought notes, useful as building blocks for essays and bigger projects.\n\nA walk in the forest garden of the mind refers to my daily visits to this collection. My walks involve planting, replanting, pruning, or nurturing of existing species in the garden. Therefore, different species form interconnections that you could access through the mind trails and the topography of thoughts present under each note.\n\n[[thoughts/my purpose is to live deliberately|My purpose is to live deliberately]]. Therefore, my main motivation for walking in the world and in this digital garden is to transform seeds of thoughts and experiences into decisive [[thoughts/action|actions]] leading to [[thoughts/intentional living|intentional living]]. Thus, I recognize that [[thoughts/my work is religious in nature|my work is religious in nature]].\n\nFor some context, see: [[thoughts/my quest|my quest]].\n\nFor a longer narrative of how I got here, see my essay [[essays/a never-ending walk|A Never-ending Walk]].\n\nYou can start exploring the digital garden by clicking on the following points of entry.

    "title": "Steal Like An Artist — Kleon",
    "content": "\n## Steal like an artist\n\n- Only study art that you can steal from.\n- Spend your day looking for art you can steal from.\n- Since nothing is original, your job is to embrace as much influence as possible and repeat what has been said when no one was listening.\n- Be very intentional in building your own genealogy of influence (teachers, friends, books).\n- Be the mashup of your influences.\n- Your job is to selectively collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by.\n- Climb your family tree by chewing on one thinker, studying everything there is to know about that thinker. Then, find the people that thinker loved and do the same. Climb as far as you can. Once you build your tree, start your own branch. See yourself as part of a creative lineage. Hang pictures of your heroes on your studio.\n- Go deep. Chase down every reference. Read bibliographies.\n- Save your thefts in a note-taking system. Open that system when you need inspiration.\n\n## Don't wait until you know who you are to get started.\n\n- It's in the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who wwe are.\n- All artists don't really know what they are doing. They just show up and wait for the good thing to come by doing the work.\n- Start doing the work you want to be doing until you find success.\n- Learn by pretending to be your heroes.\n- Figure out who to copy then what to copy. Copy from all your heroes. Copy their style but more importantly, the thinking behind their style.\n- Try to copy your heroes, but it is from your failure to do so that you will become yourself. Where you fail is where you become different. Amplify and transform that into your own work.\n\n## Write the book you want to read.\n- Whenever you're at a loss for what move to make next, ask yourself: \"What would make a better story?\"\n- Once you have built a family tree, ask yourself: What did my heroes miss? What didn't they make? What could've been made better? If they are still alive, what would they be making today? If all your favorite makers got together and collaborated, what would they make with you leading the crew?\n\n## Use your hands.\n- Find a way to bring your body into your work.\n\t- Stand up while working.\n\t- Use analog materials.\n\t- Have two desks: 1 analog and 1 electronic. Do your thinking in analog then editing or publishing in electronic.\n\n## Side projects and hobbies are important.\n- Have different projects you can bounce around for productive procrastination.\n- Take time to be bored.\n- Keep all your passions in your life. Let them talk together.\n- Don't worry about a grand scheme or unified vision for your work. What unifies your work is you. You can only connect the dots by looking backwards not forwards.\n\n## The secret: Do good work and share it with people.\n- Enjoy your obscurity while it lasts, before you are popular and paid. Use it to experiment, play, and get better without the pressure of pleasing others.\n- Do the work every day. Embrace failure.\n- Wonder about the things that nobody is wondering about. Then invite others to wonder with you by giving away your secrets.\n- Share your search. Share ideas that aren't fully formed. Use your website as an incubator, a place to fill up.\n- Share glimpses of your process that could be helpful to others (tips, links, book, sketches of your work). You don't have to connect the dots.\n\n## Geography is no longer our master.\n- You can build your own world around you wherever you are now. Connect with mentors and peers online. Surround yourself with the books and objects that you love.\n- Self-impose solitude in a space and time and see the world come to you.\n- Leave home once in a while to break the monotony and rewire your brain.\n- Live around interesting people who don't necessarily do what you do.\n- Find a place that feeds you creatively, socially, spiritually, and literally.\n\n## Be nice. The world is a small town.\n- Ignore enemies. Say nice things to friends.\n- Follow people online who are smarter than you and pay attention to what they're talking about, doing, and linking to. Be helpful to them.\n- Quit picking fights. Use your anger by creating something that corrects what's wrong.\n- Write a public fan letter (a blog post) about the work of someone you admire then link to their site.\n\t- Make something in dedication to them.\n\t- Answer their question.\n\t- Solve a problem for them.\n\t- Improve on their work and share online.\n\t- Do all of these without expecting anything in return.\n- Don't ask for validation from external sources. You can't control how people will react.\n- Be too busy doing your work that you don't have time to listen to external negative feedback.\n- Keep a praise file that you reread sparingly when you need the lift.\n\n## Be boring. It's the only way to get work done.\n- Take care of your health. Use your energy for creative work.\n- Live cheaply and stay out of debt.\n- Find a day job that:\n\t- connects you with the world\n\t- provides a constraint for your creative routine\n\t- pays decently\n\t- doesn't make you vomit\n\t- leaves you with enough energy for your art\n- Use a calendar to track your reative habit ala Seinfield. Do not break the chain.\n- Use a logbook to list the things you do every day to keep track of how far you've sailed.\n- Marry well and build relationships that help you thrive in your creative pursuit.\n\n## Creativity is subtraction.\n- Figure out what to leave out so you can concentrate on what's really important to you.\n- Get over creative block by putting constraints on yourself. Limitation means freedom.\n- What we leave out from our work is what makes it interesting. What we haven't experienced makes us interesting.\n\n# References\n\nKleon, A.

    "content": "\n# How does the internet actually work\n\nThe internet is not a cloud. It is a long piece of wire that connects computers to each other. In these wires are connected two kinds of computers. The first kind are called web servers. Web servers are like libraries that serve you the data you need. They hold data that they provide upon request. The second kind are clients. These are the computers we use to connect to the internet.\n\nIf there are so much information in a server, how do web servers help us find the exact information we are looking for?\n\nThe processing of information happens this way:\n\n1. Client via browser sends a request by typing google.com.\n2. The Internet Service Provider (ISP) receives that request.\n3. The ISP sends that request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server, which is basically a phone book of contacts. It returns the IP address for a requested website. All computers connected to the internet has its own IP address. It is like a postal address.\n4. The ISP sends the IP address to the client.\n5. The client then sends a direct message to that IP address to the ISP.\n6. The ISP relays that message to the Internet Backbone. The backbone is made up of many of wires that traverse entire oceans under submarine cables.\n7. The request goes directly to the IP address, which is the address of the requested page’s server (Google).\n8. The server sends back the data requested and the browser reflects it.\n\nThis process happens in milliseconds.\n\n### Review\n\n- What is the Internet?\n- What are web servers?\n- What are clients?\n- What is an ISP?\n- What is a DNS server?\n- What is an IP address?\n- What is a browser?\n- How does data and information flow through the Internet?\n\n# How do websites work?\n\nWhat does HTML, CSS, and Javascript do exactly?\n\nUse a browser.\n\nThe data you receive from the internet consists of three types of files:\n\n1. HTML - responsible for the structure of your website\n2. CSS - responsible for styling your website\n3. JS - responsible for making your website behave and do things\n\n### Review\n\n- What is the difference between HTML, CSS, and JS?\n\n# How to get the most out of this course\n\n1. Avoid typing the code along with the instructor.\n2. After the 10 minute mark, stop the video then ask yourself: What is going on? What is the purpose of the code being written?\n3. Type the code and replicate what happened in the 10 minutes.\n4. Take notes using the cornell note-taking system:\n   1. Write the title of the lesson.\n   2. Write notes.\n   3. Write questions based on the notes.\n   4. Write a summary of the lesson.\n5. If you are struggling with a particular topic, bookmark it, leave it for a while, then come back to it later.\n6. When stuck, use Google and stackoverflow.\n\n# How to get help when you're stuck\n\n1. Define the expectation vis a vis the reality.\n   1. What did you expect your code will do?\n   2. What did it actually do?\n2. Then look for what caused the difference.\n3. Paste the error messages in Google.\n4. If there are results from stack overflow, look at those.\n5. Rewatch the videos, you may have made a mistake right before your code went wrong.\n6. Check your code against the code you are copying.\n7. Use the Q\u0026A section in indivudal videos. Include the timestamp.\n\n# Introduction to HTML\n\nWeb browsers interpret web files to display web pages.\n\nThe foundation of all websites.\n\nYou can create a website purely using HTML but not purely using CSS or JS.\n\nHTML = Hypertext Markup Language\n\nHTML has a common ancestry with XML (Extensible Markup Language) and GML (Generalized Markup Language)\n\nThey all came from the markup symbols proofreaders put in manuscripts.\n\n[CodePen](https://codepen.io/)\n\nMarkup symbols used by editors in the past defined how letters, words, etc. should appear.\n\nHTML tags also define how elements of a web page should appear.\n\n\u003ctag name\u003e\n\nAlways close an open tag.\n\nThe heading tag only goes fom h1 to h6.

    "title": "The Science \u0026 Psychology Of Goal-Setting 101",
    "content": "\n“Goal setting in psychology refers to a successful plan of action that we set for ourselves. It guides us to choose the right moves, at the right time, and in the right way”\n\n“individuals who had highly ambitious goals had a better performance and output rate than those who didn’t.”\n\n“effective goals are ones that are:\n\nA – Achievable\n\nB – Believable\n\nC – Committed”\n\n“Goal-setting as a psychological tool for increasing productivity involves five rules or criterion, known as the S-M-A-R-T rule.”\n\n“Cecil Alec Mace was the first person to carry out empirical studies on goal-setting. His work emphasized the importance of willingness to work and indicated that the right plans could be a sure shot predictor of professional success (Mace, 1935). Locke continued his research on goal-setting from there, and in the 1960s, came up with the explanation of the usefulness of goals for a happier and more content life.”\n\n“Goals play a dominant role in shaping the way we see ourselves and others. A person who is focused and goal-oriented is likely to have a more positive approach towards life and perceive failures as temporary setbacks, rather than personal shortcomings.”\n\n“Studies have shown that when we train our mind to think about what we want in life and work towards reaching it, the brain automatically rewires itself to acquire the ideal self-image and makes it an essential part of our identity. If we achieve the goal, we achieve fulfillment, and if we don’t, our brain keeps nudging us until we achieve it.”\n\n“Studies have shown that the more we align our core values and principles, the more likely we are to benefit from our goal plans. (Kearns)”\n\n“A practical goal plan calls for a reality check. We become aware of our strengths and weaknesses and choose actions that are in line with our potentials.”\n\n“Realizing our abilities and accepting them is a vital aspect of goal-setting as it makes room for introspection and helps in setting realistic expectations from ourselves.”\n\n“Successful accomplishment of goals is a clear indicator of our success. We don’t need validation from others once we have achieved the goals we set for ourselves.”\n\n“The Process Goals\n\nThese are the ones involving the execution of plans.”\n\n“The focus is to form the habit that will ultimately lead to achievement.”\n\n“The Performance Goals\n\nThese goals help in tracking progress and give us a reason for continuing the hard work.”\n\n“The Outcome Goals”\n\n“Outcome goals are the successful implementations of process and performance goals. They keep us in perspective and help to stay focused on the bigger picture.”\n\n“goal-setting ensures success by serving three purposes:”\n\n“Enlightening Us\n\nProviding meaningful insight into our abilities and weaknesses, and by helping us prioritize our goals depending on our needs.\n\nEncouraging Us\n\nIt provides the motivation and courage to implement the goals and execute the plans efficiently.\n\nEnabling Us\n\nGoal-setting enables us to achieve the balance between our real and ideal self. By implementing the goals and succeeding from it, we regain self-confidence, social support, and can evaluate our achievements.”\n\n“Goals direct our actions and open us to a host of new possibilities. They help us stick to the relevant activities and get rid of what is irrelevant for goal-satisfaction.”\n\n“Positive psychology incorporates the principles of goal-setting in several ways:”\n\n“It commits to a specific set of actions for goal-setting.”\n\n“It considers individual ethics and core values before setting goals.\n\nIt aligns actions to individual capacities and character strengths.\n\nIt has space for introspection and insight into one’s thoughts, emotions, and perceptions.\n\nIt helps in setting realistic goals and expectations, thereby aiming to boost self-confidence and energy by task accomplishments.”\n\n“optimistic people have a strong sense of self, which helps them derive the motivation to set goals and extend them for self-improvement.”\n\n“Positive psychology, according to Latham, intersects with goal-setting in the sense that it calls for building self-efficacy and create a sense of mastery over our internal and external environments.”\n\n“successful goal-setting mainly involves asking three questions to the self:\n\nHow important is the goal for us?\n\nHow confident are we about reaching and accomplishing the goal?\n\nHow consistent is the goal with our core values and beliefs?”\n\n“Smith said that successful leaders and management professionals use this systematic approach when striving for goal accomplishments and use threads of positive psychology such as optimism, thought replacement, strength, and resilience.”\n\n“The goal-setting theory by Edwin Locke (1968) answered all the seemingly important questions about the importance of goals for a successful life. Locke’s prime concern was to establish the power of setting accurate and measurable goals.”\n\n“He believed that rather than focusing on general outcomes, professional goal-setting and management should focus on meticulousness of the tasks and address specific goals for each area of accomplishment. The goal-setting theory Locke designed, set an impetus to increased productivity and achievement.”\n\n“Locke believed that there are five key principles of goal-setting:”\n\n“Clarity – How specific and comprehensive the goal is.\n\nChallenge – How difficult the goal is and the degree to which it requires us to extend our abilities.\n\nCommitment – How dedicated we are to reach the goal and what value it renders to us.\n\nFeedback – How our achievements are perceived and recognized by others. Positive feedback increases satisfaction after achieving the target.\n\nComplexity – The difficulty of the tasks that we need to accomplish for reaching the ultimate goal.”\n\n“Locke said that there are four core components of a goal that makes it useful. These are the key aspects that we should keep in mind before committing to a plan.”\n\n“Although while selecting a target, we may tend to shun away from choosing the harder ones, difficult goals are undoubtedly more motivating, energizing, and satisfying after accomplishment.”\n\n“Thus, before setting goals, it is vital that we choose only the ones that are truly rewarding to us, no matter how much we need to push ourselves to achieve it.”\n\n# References\n\n[https://positivepsychology.com/goal-setting-psychology/](https://positivepsychology.com/goal-setting-psychology/)",

    "content": "\nThe image awakened a clear and strong desire in him to become just like that Buddha: someone who embodied calm, peace, and ease, and who could help others around him also be calm, peaceful, and at ease.\n\nBuddhism, if updated and restored to its core teachings and practices, *could* truly help relieve suffering in society, and offer a nonviolent path to peace, prosperity, and independence\n\nBuddhism, if updated and restored to its core teachings and practices, *could* truly help relieve suffering in society, and offer a nonviolent path to peace, prosperity, and independence\n\nthe importance of studying science and economics in order to understand the actual roots of suffering, and not rely only on chanting and prayer.\n\nFor example, *Tiến Hóa* Buddhist magazine. Thầy was also inspired by the writings of Zen Master Thích Mật Thể (1912-1961) and the author Nguyễn Trọng Thuật (1883–1940). Both figures saw the deep riches in Vietnamese Zen history and the capacity of Buddhism to bring about “a new spring” for Vietnam, the kind of Buddhist renewal also being proposed by other reformers and modernists elsewhere, for example, the Chinese Master Taixu (1890-1947). Thích Mật Thể studied with Master Tinh Nghiêm (Qing Yan) in China, and brought back his ideas to Huế.\n\nThầy and his friends stayed and studied at a number of other different temples, for weeks or months at a time, while they pursued their self-directed studies.\n\nHe dug deep into Vietnam’s own history to propose a truly Vietnamese way out of the situation, drawing on the very engaged role Buddhism had played during the Trần and Lý Dynasties between the 11th and 13th Centuries, that had so inspired him as a young monk.\n\n**How Thay's Buddhism was different**\n\nWith this new dream of a “rural practice center” Thầy definitively broke free of the mould of the traditional Buddhist temple with its ceremonies and rituals, and created an environment exclusively dedicated to spiritual practice, study, healing, music, poetry, and community-building. They enjoyed sitting meditation in the early morning, tea meditation in the afternoons, and sitting meditation in the evenings. Phương Bối was an experimental model for the renewal and reinvigoration of Buddhism. Though few may have foreseen it, Phương Bối became a prototype for Thầy’s many “mindfulness practice centers” that would flourish around the world by the end of the century.\n\nThầy’s influence in Asia bloomed, especially among the young, who were drawn to his new style of Buddhism, free from dogma, ritual, and superstition.\n\nAt his centers, he has stripped away many rituals, formalities, and esoteric observances to restore the living essence of Buddhist meditation practice. In so doing he has gone beyond simply teaching “Mahayana Zen” Buddhism, per se, to teaching a modern, renewed, revitalized Buddhism and meditation practice in harmony with the spirit of the Buddha’s original teachings.\n\nThầy has revitalized Buddhism for the twenty-first century, and transformed Buddhism from a devotional or scholarly pursuit into a living practice that can continue to renew itself.\n\nHe has integrated ancient Buddhist wisdom with elements from Western psychology, science, ecology, ethics, and education, to address the deep roots of fear, violence, oppression, injustice, and environmental destruction; and offer a way forward for the human family to touch peace, reconciliation and true happiness.\n\n**Using mindful walking to heal himself from depression**\n\nBut Thầy had the intuition that, if only he could master his full awareness of breathing and walking, he would be able to truly heal. It was the very challenges of the 1950s that forged the deepening of Thầy’s personal practice, and gave him the spiritual strength he needed to find a way forward. As a young monk, Thầy studied the principle of counting and following the breath and trained in formal slow walking meditation (*kinh hành*). But Buddhist Institutes in Vietnam did not teach an applied meditation practice for personal healing; only meditation theory. And so, faced with deep suffering, Thầy had to discover for himself a healing way to meditate. He experimented with a new method to combine his breath and steps more naturally while walking and, instead of counting only the breath, he counted the steps in harmony with the breath. With this concentration he was able to tenderly embrace his pain and acute despair without being swept away by strong feelings.\n\n**Create something that is needed but not yet there**\n\nAs Thầy reflected later, “It was not easy because the tradition does not directly offer Engaged Buddhism. So we had to do it by ourselves.”\n\n**Thay’s accessible writing style**\n\nThe spirit and approach of *A Rose Your Pocket* broke entirely new ground in Buddhist writing, and crystallised Thầy’s distinctive writing style. There had never before been a book in Vietnamese which so lyrically applied Buddhist insights into a spiritual perspective on daily life, and it rapidly became a bestseller. Written in natural, poetic language that even children could understand, *A Rose for Your Pocket* didn’t have the form of a Buddhist teaching, but was in essence a guided meditation to help the reader to touch the wonder of their mother’s presence in the here and now. For the first time, a Buddhist monk was showing how meditative awareness could be a bright and gentle energy. The reader could touch the fruit of meditation without having to turn their heart and mind into a battlefield, fighting anger, grief, or craving. With its publication Thầy, who hitherto had been known as a poet, editor and Buddhist scholar, became known for his deep and accessible Buddhism.\n\n**Thay’s influences**\n\nAfter completing his year at Princeton, Thầy stayed on in the U.S. and continued his research at Columbia (1962-3). There, he made the most of the extensive Buddhist collection in the Butler Library, and benefited from the mentorship of the distinguished Professor Anton Zigmund-Cerbu and encountered the work of contemporary theologians.\n\nHe had been profoundly moved by the writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer—a German pastor and theologian, and a bold, outspoken critic of the Nazi regime, who was imprisoned and later executed in 1945.\n\nThầy discovered rare documents detailing the life of Master Tăng Hội, a monk of Vietnamese-Indian heritage in the 3rd Century, who became the first Zen Master in China, three centuries before Bodhidharma.\n\nMaster Tăng Hội practiced and taught Zen, and was a pioneer in the Mahāyāna tradition, drawing drew on the meditation texts of early Buddhism, including those emphasising conscious breathing and mindfulness (the *Satipaṭṭhāna* and _Ānāpānasati_sutras). Discovering the writings of such an important early Vietnamese Zen master was a deep source of inspiration, and laid a path for the kind of Zen Thầy would develop and teach in the West.\n\n**Thay’s insight on November 2, 1962 after reading Bonhoeffer**\n\n...I was awakened to the starry sky that dwells in each of us. I felt a surge of joy, accompanied by the faith that *I could endure even greater suffering than I had thought possible*. Bonhoeffer was the drop that made my cup overflow, the last link in a long chain, the breeze that nudged the ripened fruit to fall. After experiencing such a night, I will never complain about life again. [...] All feelings, passions, and sufferings revealed themselves as wonders, yet I remained grounded in my body. Some people might call such an experience ‘religious,’ but *what I felt was totally and utterly human.* *I knew in that moment that there was no enlightenment outside of my own mind and the cells of my body. Life is miraculous, even in its suffering. Without suffering, life would not be possible.*\n\n**What Thay cultivated**\n\nunderstanding, compassion, tolerance, and deep listening.\n\n“What we were doing was very similar—building community, blending the seeds of wisdom, compassion, and nonviolence.”\n\n**Personal renewal in the middle of chaos**\n\n“Engaged Buddhism is born in such a difficult situation, in which you want to maintain your practice while responding to the suffering. You seek the way to do walking meditation right there, in the place where people are still running under the bombs. And you learn how to practice mindful breathing while helping care for a child who has been wounded by bullets or bombs.”\n\n“In a situation of utmost suffering like that, we [have to] practice in such a way that we preserve our hope and our compassion.”\n\n“It did not seem that there was any hope of an end, because the war had been dragging on for so long. I had to practice a lot of mindful breathing and coming back to myself. I have to confess I did not have a lot of hope at this time, but if I’d had *no* hope, it would have been devastating for these young people. I had to practice deeply and nourish the little hope I had inside so I could be a refuge for them.”\n\n**Order of Interbeing neutrality**\n\nIt embodied Thầy’s teaching of “not taking sides in a conflict,” and emphasised non-attachment to views, and freedom from all ideologies. For Thầy these precepts were “a direct answer to war, a direct answer to dogmatism, where everyone is ready to kill and die for their beliefs.”\n\n“The Vietnam War was, first and foremost, an ideological struggle. To ensure our people’s survival, we had to overcome both communist and anticommunist fanaticism, and maintain the strictest neutrality. Buddhists tried their best to speak for all the people and not take sides, but we were condemned as ‘pro-communist neutralists.’ Both warring parties claimed to speak for what the people really wanted, but the North Vietnamese spoke for the communist bloc and the South Vietnamese spoke for the capitalist bloc. The Buddhists only wanted to create a vehicle for the people to be heard—and the people only wanted peace, not a “victory” by either side.”\n\n**The importance of understanding**\n\nThe tragedy marked Thầy and led him to dig ever deeper to discover the roots of hatred and violence, which he found to be in wrong perceptions. Thầy said, “We must use the sword of understanding to put an end to all views we have about each other; all notions and labels. All these labels must be cut off. Views can lead us to fanaticism. They can destroy human beings. They can destroy love.”\n\n**Compassion**\n\nHe reaffirmed the importance of not demonizing the enemy and described compassion as a sign of great courage and strength––not of weakness––and the best way to guarantee true security and peace.\n\n**Thay's vision: the beloved community**\n\nshared global vision of a ‘beloved community,’ a fellowship among peoples and nations built on principles of nonviolence, reconciliation, justice, tolerance, and inclusiveness in which even enemies can become friends. Theirs was not a utopian vision, but a realistic, achievable goal attained when a critical mass of people can be trained in the principles and practices of peace and nonviolence.\n\n**Practice**\n\nWorking long days, Thầy guided their small community to incorporate mindfulness and compassion in every action: whether making phone calls, drafting documents, writing letters, eating meals together, or simply washing dishes. The days would end with songs and silent sitting meditation.\n\nin even the most difficult situations, with mindful breathing, peace, clarity, and insight are always possible.\n\nwe can embrace even the greatest adversity with courage and compassion, and that our true presence is the best gift we can offer those we love.\n\n**Environment**\n\nDeep ecology, interbeing, and the importance of protecting the Earth continued to evolve as a powerful theme in Thầy’s teachings, ethics, and writings.\n\n**The root of the problem**\n\n“There’s a lot of anger in the peace movement,” he observed. And so Thầy’s focus shifted from demonstrations and press conferences to the deeper work of transforming consciousness through mindfulness retreats and community living. “Even if we were able to transport all the bombs to the moon, we’d still be unsafe, because the roots of war and bombs are still there in our collective consciousness,” he said. “We cannot abolish war with angry demonstrations. Transforming our collective consciousness is the only way to uproot it.”\n\n**The power of community**\n\nThầy had come to see the creation of physical environments of peace and communities of mindful living as the surest way to heal the wounds of war and suffering and to cultivate the seeds of peace, healing, reconciliation and awakening in the world.\n\nThầy saw the healing potential of exploring the art of mindful living, as a community, close to nature.\n\nHe came to value the importance of the teacher-student relationship: making a lifetime commitment to study and practice together without interruption in the context of a residential community of mindful living.\n\n**Community-building**\n\nThầy pioneered greater equality between nuns and monks, and emphasised decision-making by consensus rather than by authority, becoming the first Buddhist master from the East to combine seniority and democracy in the governance of the monastic community\n\nThầy emphasised the power of collective meditation practice for healing and transformation; and the importance of building local mindfulness groups (or ‘sanghas’), to offer companionship, joy, and solidarity, and address the loneliness, alienation, and individualism prevailing in the modern world.\n\n**How Thay’s meditation retreat differs from sesshins**\n\nThầy developed a retreat program that incorporated a new style of guided sitting meditation, his new form of relaxed outdoor walking meditation, a more intimate and less formalised practice of eating meditation, guided lying-down relaxations, small discussion groups, tea meditation, “service meditation” (working in the garden, cleaning the bathrooms or washing pots), and guided instructions for deep prostrations (a practice known as “Touching the Earth”). He drew on his strong foundation in Buddhist psychology and understanding of Western culture to develop uniquely Buddhist practices for compassionate communication and reconciliation. All these practices, developed by Thầy himself in Plum Village in France, created a powerful new model for mindfulness retreats that has today been popularised around the world.\n\n**Thay’s views on ethics**\n\nThầy insisted that ethics and mindfulness could not be separated; and that meditation or mindfulness without ethics is not true mindfulness.\n\nThầy drafted a new universal code of ethics in the Buddhist tradition—The Five Mindfulness Trainings\n\nThầy was invited to bring his teachings on applied ethics to China\n\n**Mindfulness teachers that attended Thay’s retreats**\n\nJoan Halifax, Jack Kornfield, Joanna Macy, Sharon Salzberg and Jon Kabat-Zinn\n\n**Thay’s idea of interbeing (and a peek to his epistemology)**\n\nThich Nhat Hanh, Dharma Talk in Plum Village, October 1, 2013: “We have to inter-be. We use the word interbeing in order to free ourselves from the idea of being. We say we inter-are to free ourselves from the idea that we can be by ourselves alone. As soon as we are free of the idea of being we are free from the idea of non-being. Thanks to the idea of interbeing we are free from both being and non-being. That is thanks to the skill of the “wisdom of adaptation.” We may still use words and concepts but we use them very skilfully to gradually free ourselves from words and concepts. We make use of new notions like co-arising and interbeing in order to free ourselves from old notions like birth and death, being and non-being. Once we are free from these ideas we can then also let go of the notions interbeing and co-arising; just like when we use a spade to dig a well, once we have dug the well we put the spade down. We do not need to carry it around with us everywhere. While co-arising and interbeing help us transcend birth, death, being and non-being, they are not an ultimate truth to be held on to forever.” (translated from Vietnamese)\n\n“To be is to inter-be. You cannot just be by yourself alone; you have to inter-be with every other thing.”\n\nThầy went on to teach that you cannot have happiness without suffering, the mud without the lotus. The ‘insight of interbeing’ became central to his teachings on communication, ecology, conflict-resolution, political division and even personal family relationships. The word ‘interbeing’ although it still uses words and the idea of ‘being’ is a skilful way to go beyond dualistic ideas of separation to touch the true nature of reality. Interbeing became one of Thầy’s most distinctive contributions to Buddhist teaching.\n\n“My father is there in every cell of my body,” he said in one of his talks. “My mother also. My grandfathers, my grandmothers, my ancestors, they have not died; they are fully present in every cell of my body. When I hear the bell, I invite all of them to join me in listening. As we hear the bell, we can say silently: *We listen, we listen. This wonderful sound brings us back to our true home*.”\n\n**True home (private property) and freedom cannot be taken away**\n\n“thanks to the practice I was able to find my true home in the here and the now. Your true home is not an abstract idea, it is a solid reality you can touch with your feet, with your hands, with your mind. It is available in the here and the now, and nobody can take it away. They can occupy your country, yes. They can put you in prison, yes. But they cannot take away your true home and your freedom.”\n\nfreedom that an outsider can observe may be hindered. but the sense of freedom is always personal and can be transformed whatever the situation is. one can be free inside without being free outside.\n\n**Must read works**\n\nThe Heart of the Buddha’s Teachings - Buddhist primer\n\nOld Path White Clouds - biography of the Buddha without miraculous embellisment\n\nJoyfully Together: The Art of Building a Harmonious Community\n\nAlthough Thầy succeeded in making Buddhism accessible to western audiences, he maintained that Buddhism should never be diluted.\n\n**Buddhism out of its contexth**\n\nThe nineties and early 2000s saw Thầy bringing Buddhist practices and teachings out of their primarily religious context to be of service to the world\n\nThầy offered concrete recommendations to support ethics, prosperity, and progress in civil society, education, and international relations.\n\n**Environment**\n\nThe insight of ‘interbeing’ became a foundation for his engaged action. Thầy published *The World We Have* (2008), fearlessly telling the truth, and outlining a Buddhist approach to the growing environmental crisis\n\nIn 2007 he led his entire community to become vegan, as a powerful message on how a plant-based diet can reduce suffering and protect the Earth.\n\n**True happiness**\n\nThầy’s teachings emphasized the importance of touching what he called ‘true happiness’ right in the heart of the present moment. He maintained that helping people touch true happiness is the best way to address the root causes of injustice, inequality, and a runaway consumption society. When we know what true happiness is, he says, it is very easy to live more simply, and to take care of ourselves, our relationships, and the Earth.\n\n**Defying catedgorization in Buddhism**\n\nOver his decades of teaching, Thầy has defied categorisation as a teacher of Zen, Pure Land, or Theravada Buddhism, preferring to say that he was “presenting the teachings of Early Buddhism in a Mahayana spirit,” or “taking Mahayana Buddhism to bathe in the waters of Early Buddhism.”\n\n# References",

Without astonishment you won't write about it.\n\nThe moment ends even before I could capture it in words or in photos.\n\nAll writing is existential.\n\nProject idea: A website that you can shuffle and get an inspirational quote.\n\nAcar: Reminding Existence\n\nEven the struggle should lead us to awe.\nWe are here when we shouldn't.\n\nGIGO: I want to focus my reading list on reading words that refresh. In my version, these are the same words that I want to create: lyrical philosophy. Philosophy that reminds us of our existential reality. Words that make us want to make the most.\n\nSuicide is the greatest subject of writing. One, there is the responsibility involved in writing about the topic. Studies show that suicide rates increase whenever media covers suicide. It is as if whenever we talk about it, we endanger someone else's life. Then there's the mystery of it all. Those who took their own lives won't be able to tell us what happened at the last moment before they went.\n\nWhen I was young, on one of the preaching walks, the woman we were talking with told us about a recent suicide in their community. I judged the person who committed it. Why would someone ever do such a thing? To hurt himself. People who do that commit the most unforgivable sin.\n\nYou won't understand suicide until you are there. Until it is the only thing that makes sense. That your brain is in so much pain that you cannot take it any longer and it is the only way out. It is all about pain. The way I experienced it. I know some people had the time to philosophize about it. My experience was that I was just really desperate of whatever physical thing I caught. Because it was physical.\n\nBut what that experience taught me was not giving up. Or giving up but not giving in. It is ok to accept defeat to let go. But I gave myself the chance to be patient. And patience was everything. Waiting was everything.\n\nThe waiting, I discovered from experience, happened easily when one does it day by day. Moment by moment. The by-product of this is that you appreciate the slowness of life and what happens in between. This was when I got another realization: life is inherently meaningless. The reason why it can be so easy to give in is because if we havent done the work of creating meaning (either through building relationships, touching people's lives, seeing the world, reading, etc.), it is so difficult to find a reason to keep going when in that situation. I was deep in religion but not even my beliefs saved me. And this is why I think, a lot of young people who caught depression, easily give up. They just havent been in this world long enough to see closer and longer for meaning. Meaning is not given. We look for it ourselves. It takes some work to create a meaningful life even among those who grew up in the healthiest families and in the most privileged situations.\n\nSuicide is the single most important motivation. We want to find the good in life as much as we can to never ever want to let it go. And if ever this resolved is challenged, we know we are stronger.\n\nFor those who have never experience the urge to harm themselves, be grateful for it, but never ever judged those who do. And while you're life is perfect, make the most adavantage of your time by finding meaning as much as you can.\n\n(Whenever I think deeply and closely at my experience, I like myself better. I feel good. I feel like I'm a better person.)",

These are all mental stuff contacting mental stuff. No physical to mental reactions that touch on platonic abstractions, the objective glue.\n\nThis is the reason why no matter how great a picture we have painted in our minds of someone we have met online, our feelings could instantly change when we are with them. This is chemistry. Relationships can occur but these are incomplete and by virtue of their incompleteness they will be weaker than relationships with physical components.\n\nHow to be in a relationship with place?\n\nI like how Jack Gilbert does it. His poems are almost vignettes. And they could easily be vignettes seen outdoors.\n1. Sharpen your grasp of existentialism\n2. Sharpen your knowledge of ways to execute existential language\n3.

There might even be no paths. These may all have been trees, weeds, or who knows, just a wide long piece of dirt. But from this vantage point, that walker would have been looking at the same structure in the sky. The mountains have changed throughout the years but they were there. On this part of the path the walker would've also felt nostalgic. He would've pondered about who may have walked here hundred years before him, what he was thinking. Would that third walker be as curious as us. Or would the walker be a woman running away from the village into this one big tree, grieving the freedom she just lost from a marriage with a man she doesn't love.\n\nI smell daing\n\nI never knew I'll ever do this but listening to Steve a while ago and doing this afternoon walk, made me feel the importance of public spaces, of having a public life. I often value being in private, solitary, far from people. But without contact, relationships are impossible. No matter what political stand we hold, the truth is that we are stuck to each other. And being stuck in a nation, being stuck in this space and place, means I need to be with others. And there is a better way of being with others, which is really being around them, really understanding them.\n\nIn a way, CM's work is existential. Anthropology is existential.\n\nProcess\n1. Walk + collect seeds\n2. Do initial cultivation in diary\n3. Plant the seedlings from diary to Obsidian\n4. Publish to share to the world\n\nEven if walking is only methodology, it brings out other issues, issues relevant to enacting the method. How are our public spaces? Are they safe? Who occupies them? Are they designed in favor of one group and not of another? How can we create more inclusive public spaces?",

I remember seeing a lump of meat one time when I was going up forestry. From afar it looked like a log albeit a weird looking one. Upon closer inspection, I saw that it was a body of a dead dog hardened by the cold. Its stomach bulged and its hind legs were apart like branches of a dead log. As I remember this, I waited for a lone car going down Lantican to pass the first dog I saw. Made sure it was ok. A few months ago, two cats of UPLB died from separate car crashes. These happened about an hour apart. I notice that drivers here drive faster when there are more people or animals on the road or when the roads are narrower. They go against nature. Perhaps this is why I can't make myself buy a car no matter what I do. I prefer walking.\n\nThe Narra Guest House\n\nAnd because I almost always walk in the night, I always see the narra guest house in its darkest. A dim lamppost provides the little light that would allow one to see its facade. It is further proof that this road was indeed called Narra before it was Lantican Ave.\n\nThe biggest surprise to the intellectually curious is that when you are patient enough to ask the question \"why,\" you will come to a point when you realize there is no big purpose, no God, nothing up there. Depending on your taste, you would either treat this as doom or liberation.\n\nWalking to Forestry on a Caffeinated Mind\n\nI took a tablespoon filled with coffee and mixed it on hot water an hour before I walked. And now that I am walking to forestry I could hear everything, see everything, feel everything. I raise my head up at the sky and see the clouds dissolving into the night like coffee granules on hot water.\n\nDon't stress too much about what to read next. Let your curiosity and needs dictate that. As long as there's at least 1 prose book and 1 poetry book on your plate you'll be fine. Focus more on making good use of the information you get from your reading.",

    "content": "\nThe word action is a concept, a mental model used to describe a phenomena that occurs in the real world. The phenomena is this: Action is behavior with intention that intervenes in one’s status quo and results in an end state that may or may not approximate one’s original goal. It is the employment of means to attain a [[desire]].\n\n[[James Clear]] said that [[Habit]] is the smallest unit of behavior. I disagree: it is action. [[action is the basic unit of behavior|Action is the basic unit of behavior]].\n\nActions has several parts:\n\n1. [[thoughts/intention]]\n2. [[Means]] \n3. [[End state]]\n4. [[Review]]\n\n---\nAction, a definition\n\n- An actor (conscious or unconscious)\n- Change in motion\n- Change in time\n\n---\nAn action could create a [[core desired mental state]] immediately or stack with other actions to create the desired mental state over time. For example, if one's intention is to feel ginhawa as often as possible, one could get there through two means:\n1. Short-term: Involves a few acttion and external factors\n2. Long-term: Involves multiple actions and external factors that set the stage for easier Ginhawa\n\nBecause Ginhawa is a mental state, it lies in the canvas of space and time and can only be achieved through action. To live a life filled with Ginhawa, one ought to:\n1.  Develop short-term actions (habits) that could generate it daily (e.g., well-being practices).\n2. Work on bigger, long-term projects that make generating Ginhawa easier.\n\n---\nIf one's lifestyle is goal-oriented, the process stops after the action has produced the mental state. However, if one's lifestyle is practice-oriented, one's goal should be to continuously generate the mental state by continuously performing the action.\n\n---\nThere are two kinds of action:\n1. Thinking about what action to take\n2. Doing the specific action\n\nThe first occurs in the [[Sky level]] of the [[thoughts/life management system]], while the latter occurs at the [[ground level]]. [[thoughts/living]] is about going back and forth between these two kinds of action. This back and forth makes sure that one is doing the right thing and doing it as present and mindful as possible.\n\n---\nA study of action involves an understanding of both mental and physical states because an action also contains a mental state. However, it happens at a very specific point in time. It does not include the mental states before and after its performance. Action occurs in between these mental states. Understanding action also involves a study of the rational calculations that man use to arrive at particular choices of action.\n\n---\n## Mechanics of action\n\n![[files/mechanics-of-action.jpeg]]\n\n## Related\n\n- [[An action succeeded if its end state approximates its intention]]\n- [[All actions rely on knowledge]]\n\n# References\nMises, L.

    "content": "\n**Focus on reader experience rather than market performance**\n\nSet creative goals based on specific experiences that you want your work to bring to specific people, with faces, rather than objects, tokens, or metrics. Focusing on the former provides the feelings of validation and success. Focusing on the later results to impostor syndrome.\n\nSimilarly, use reader experience as the benchmark for the value of your work rather than market performance. This involves focusing on one-on-one engagement rather than virality.\n\nFocusing on reader experience also means that success is easier to achieve. You don't have to be a bestseller to make a difference.\n\nReader experience is how the reader experiences the world through your creative work.\n\n\u003eremember names and faces, and moments with these people\n\n\u003ethink about specific experiences that indicate that you and your work connected with, and influenced, the lives of others\n\n\u003ethey don’t lead to the feeling of validation or success that these artists hoped for.

The people I see who succeed focus on one-on-one engagement with other people, not on going viral.\n\n---\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe problem lies in how they measure their success. They seek validation from big institutions, bestseller lists, sales numbers, and high-profile media. They measure how the world accepts them with followers, re-shares, reviews, likes, and favorites. They measure by numbers. ([Location 12](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=12))\n\nI want to reframe how you think about creating and sharing your work, and I want you to **disregard numbers**. When you lie on your deathbed and someone asks about the work you are most proud of, I don’t want you to think of a bestseller list. I want you to **think about specific experiences that indicate that you and your work connected with, and influenced, the lives of others**. I want you to **remember names and faces, and moments with these people**, not how many followers you had on a social network. I want… ([Location 15](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=15))\n\nSection 1: You Are a Gateway\n\nCreative Work is a Journey\n\n**object**\n**token**\n**metric**\n\nWhile these things represent what you hope for your work, **they shouldn’t be the goal. They are public milestones** the world can see and appreciate, but they mask the true impact of your work. These milestones help validate who we are, and in the process, we hope that reaching them will unlock a “next level” of success—a level where it becomes easier to create our work, to share it, and to engage others. We calculate that objects, tokens, and metrics will ensure that greater success will now come with less effort, but that doesn’t happen. ([Location 32](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=32))\n\nMost people are paralyzed by questions about goals, such as, “Where do you want to be in five years?” It’s a scary question, because it represents not just what we want to accomplish, but who we want to become. So **we default to defining our goals via objects, tokens, and metrics.** ([Location 36](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=36))\n\nThese are common markers for “success,” and are simplified versions of a reality the creator hopes to experience. But these markers are often hollow; **they don’t lead to the feeling of validation or success that these artists hoped for. Rather, they create a sense of impostor syndrome**—that their achievement was a fluke, and that soon the world will realize they didn’t deserve the accolades. Instead of feeling validated, someone with impostor syndrome is riddled with anxiety that they will be revealed as a fraud, and that they can never live up to the success people now expect of them. ([Location 42](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=42))\n\nA writer may have had their books published by large houses, received stellar reviews, been featured in national media, and won awards, yet their work didn’t sell well. Their lives before and after the book, remained unchanged. They may not only feel they are “back at square one,” but feel they are digging out of a hole, worse off than when they started, because of the stigma of failure. Even those authors who did find success with sales can still seem confused as to why the book worked, who their audience is, and how to follow it up. They feel naked and exposed, worried that they will “mess up” a success that they barely understand. ([Location 47](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=47))\n\n**Achieving these traditional markers for success—objects, tokens, and metrics—can make someone feel more lost, because they assumed this process would unlock something new for them, and instead, nothing is different.** They hoped that validation would spark a profound sense of self-esteem, yet they may feel less sure of themselves than ever. They may have assumed that selling their next idea would be easier, and it isn’t; that access to media and publicity is easier, and it isn’t; that they would earn more money with less effort, and they can’t. ([Location 54](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=54))\n\nTo solve this, people often focus on marketing and social media ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=59))\n\nAt the very least, they begin to look at every social media update as a press release that could hit the right person at the right time. However, this can create an additional pressure. Creative professionals often feel confusion over developing a “platform” around their work. They don’t know what to include on a website, what to send in an email newsletter, what to share on social media, and how to make marketing feel meaningful. ([Location 61](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=61))\n\nEven further, they feel their **pure creative vision has been corrupted by this “requirement\" to market their work**. ([Location 64](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=64))\n\nBe the gateway. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=69))\n\n**Instead of framing the value of your work by how it performs in the market, you define it by how other people experience the world through your creative work—the stories and experiences you share, and the topics you talk about.** This simple idea radically shifts the value of what you create. **Instead of selling a product in a marketplace, you become the gateway for how your work can shape the world for others, and inspire them.** ([Location 70](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=70))\n\nRegardless of your creative medium, you are a storyteller, right? Then use that gift. ([Location 73](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=73))\n\n**Reframe success so it isn’t about seeking validation from massive audiences, but rather how you reach one person. The people I see who succeed focus on one-on-one engagement with other people, not on going viral.** To be a gateway is to **find success by focusing on the human side of that which engages people, what it means to have your work truly shape the lives of others, and what it means to feel fulfilled as a creator.** ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=75))\n\nRegardless of the medium or craft, the effect of these people goes beyond the work itself—they somehow help others make sense out of life. ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=83))\n\n**When you frame your focus as a gateway instead of an object, token, or metric, it helps you identify what you want to do.** You get to focus on an experience to create, not just a milestone you dream of. The difference? **You can take action to connect with people who love your work via your gateway right now. You can take clear actions day by day, week by week, to reach the people who care about your work. When you create as a gateway, success immediately becomes more accessible.** ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=84))\n\nBeing a gateway is a higher calling than an object, token, or metric. It’s also more fun. ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=89))\n\nYour work can open up possibilities for others and forge new paths that had never before been considered. Don’t just throw “products” out into the marketplace; change the way people see the world through your creative work. ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=90))\n\nThink of it this way: a book is really a conversation that happens in the reader’s head. It is half what the author intended, and half how the reader translates it. No two people read the same book the same way. We come with biases, with needs, with a unique lifetime of experiences. ([Location 92](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=92))\n\nWhen I meet creative professionals who want help in reaching their audience, I don’t ask about their goals, but instead say, **“Tell me about the conversations you would love to be having with others.”** If I asked about their goals, they would feel forced to talk about achievements for themselves alone. Instead, I want to focus on how their creative work can have a powerful effect on others. How it can truly change the lives of thousands of people. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=97))\n\n**Being a gateway is about ensuring your work truly connects with others in the most meaningful way possible**, instead of being treated as nothing more than a product swiped across the bar code scanner at the food store. ([Location 104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=104))\n\nExperience Creates a Story ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=107))\n\nWhat is your story? **Share the process and your journey as it happens.** ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=122))\n\nBut before you run out and start a blog where you detail every struggle you have with your work, you need to pause and **identify how your story relates to the gateway you’re crafting.** This is not just about over-sharing your days on social media. It is not about revealing every moment you experience self-doubt. It is about **understanding the connection between what you create, why you create it, and how it will engage others.** This is the “secret” to engaging others, which is not really a secret at all. It is as old as human culture and how we are wired. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=124))\n\nWhat you are doing is **building a path to your gateway.** One that is wide enough, well-lit enough, and **signals to people that it is worth continuing down because right around the corner is what they seek** … your gateway. The marker that will lead them to what they are searching for. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=128))\n\nFor instance, as I write this book, I am sharing photos of myself writing and editing on Instagram and Twitter, explaining that I am writing the book. Each day, people see what my process for writing looks like: it is about showing up each day to do the work. It is about building a habit that is practical and accessible. People who follow along not only come to understand that I am writing a book and what it is about, but they begin to feel as they are a part of the process. For my audience—creative professionals—it illustrates the process. It brings them behind the scenes, and creates a story around it. ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=130))\n\nIn other words, **instead of feeling promoted to, they may resonate with the slow process to create meaningful work.** ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=136))\n\n**When you share your journey, you are building advocates** in the process; those who aren’t just aware of what you are doing, but feel connected to it in a personal way. When it comes time for you to release your creative work, you will have a crowd of people ready to help it spread. ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=140))\n\nMany creative professionals take the opposite approach. They hide away in complete silence for months or years and then make a big announcement. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=143))\n\nThey are banking on the impact of a single announcement instead of **sharing an authentic look at how their creative vision aligns with what their ideal audience dreams about.** One of these versions tells a better story than the the other, and it also slowly develops an audience for your work. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=144))\n\nThere is a difference between clearly communicating and developing advocates, and over-sharing every thought you have and meal you eat. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=148))\n\nI would encourage you to **focus on sharing experiences you have, because this is indeed how stories are created. Focus on conversations you have, because this is where you are already connecting to others on that authentic human level. Focus on how you can connect with others today around your work. How you are curious, how you are developing your skills, how you are relishing moments where you feel inspired.** Focus on adding value to the lives of others, of sharing the experience your work is meant to create for them. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=149))\n\n**Instead of dreaming up some “big brand” you want to create, simply document and share what you are passionate about. This encourages you to be aware of how your daily life aligns to your creative work. It forces you to be accountable for attending to it. When you share what drives you and how you attend to your creative work, it prevents you from getting lost in the dream.** What I mean by this is, those people who spend all of their time dreaming about the creative work they hope to create, but never find the time to actually do it. This could be a writer who constantly updates social media with writing tips and motivational quotes, but barely finds time to write themselves. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=155))\n\nThis classic writing advice applies to how you share your work: **“Show, don’t tell.”** Meaning, **don’t sell me on your work by telling me how great it is; instead, show me the process, show me why your work matters to you, and how it can connect to what I care about.** ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=165))\n\n“I think of ambition as the need to prove something to others, and the need to be recognized. A need for rewards outside of the work. Drive motivates you to do whatever it is you’re doing as well as you can.” ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=169))\n\nAs a creative professional, you become the gateway for them to experience it. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=175))\n\nWhat was clear is that she has come to represent something to her fans. She has become a lightning rod for belief systems, for a worldview. She has become the gateway for how her fans experience the world, experience each other, and experience themselves. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=199))\n\nAs a creative professional, consider what those things are. That **what you share within your creative work—and outside of it—can embody the deeper themes that drive you, and that engage your ideal audience.** ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=206))\n\nThese are **three elements that connect the work you are crafting to being a gateway for readers in the platform you develop.** ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=210))\n\n1. **STORY.** The first goal is to be a storyteller—to **craft a compelling story**. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=211))\n2. **CREATOR**. You become the gateway, **the personal way through which the reader experiences a larger topic.** You are the way in. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=216))\n3. **TOPICS**. Then come the topics, **the issues, the narratives that your story digs into**. Memoirs can be about so many things, including overcoming huge challenges that others may experience, or that come to symbolize experiences the reader is going through. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=223))\n\n**These three things work together to allow the “platform” to be the gateway for people.** ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=230))\n\nIn listening to a single song, I experienced the STORY, the CREATORS, and the TOPIC that surround it. They are related ways of engaging with the song, each level deeper and more personal than the next. This is what you should craft for your work. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=239))\n\nIf you are writing a memoir about your experience with cancer, you don’t have to write an email newsletter that steals its content from the book. Instead, you can tell other people’s stories of their experiences with cancer. Or tell stories about overcoming the odds, or dig into the many other themes that are likely buried within your book. **The platform you develop around a book should not try to re-create it—what you share online and in person should not just steal all of the stories you share in the book itself. Instead, it should tap into aspects of the story, and then extend them in new ways that the book could not.** ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=242))\n\nThis relates to **social media** as well. Too often, we use it to comment on news stories, and merely share links. Instead, **use it to tell a story—an original story—that opens up a worldview for people.** ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=247))\n\nIf you are that memoir writer whose book is about cancer, and a key theme is medical reform, don’t just link to articles in newspapers. Instead, **find and tell stories that resonate with us. Become the voice for others … the gateway for them to share their stories with the world.** I mean, how powerful is that? To not be the 1,000th person to share the link to a newspaper article, but to **be the first person to tell someone’s story that needs to be heard**? ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=249))\n\nLet’s face it, this is why someone crafts creative work—they become a gateway for others. When people walk through the gateway, they enjoy powerful benefits: ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=264))\n\n• They experience a compelling story or experience\n• They see the world in a new way\n• They shape their own identity ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=266))\n\n**You are a gateway to the identity that someone wants for themselves, or that highlights an aspect of themselves they want to be more clear, more in the forefront, more real. Even if your work takes years to craft, you can still be a gateway right now. Even to one person.** Or to dozens. Or hundreds. Or thousands. Opening up their world. Their identity. Their experience. Their connection to others. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=269))\n\n“Dan, I want my work to speak for itself. I don’t want to have to consider my audience, and engage with them, nor do I myself want to represent what they love in my work.” I tend to think that this is a romantic view of how creative work is crafted, published, discovered, and consumed. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=272))\n\nEven when we find someone’s narrative that seems more “pure” about the strength of the art itself finding an audience, a gateway is still present. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=278))\n\nWhen someone experiences any creative work—a book, art, music, photography, etc.—it is an act of co-creation. The creator has crafted it with a vision in mind, but the person who experiences it does so through the filter of their own life. They interpret it in ways unique to themselves. If you and I each listen to the same song, we each may interpret it in different ways. We may experience different emotions at different points in the song, and we may feel differently about it based on our individual experience with music or the artist themselves. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=283))\n\nThrough your creative work, you get to craft the stories of how others find and engage with it. Your art, your craft is not objective—it will be experienced by different people in different ways. You get to shape that, and it becomes the gateway for others. Now, let’s consider how these stories align to the identities that your audience seeks. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=301))\n\nStories Create the Identity Your Audience Seeks ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=303))\n\n**What does your audience want, more than anything? An identity.** They want to feel cool. They want to feel creative. They want to feel free. They want to feel as though they live by a deep moral code. They want to feel they are the real deal. They want to be old school. They want to be cutting edge. They want to be compassionate. They want to be unwavering. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=306))\n\nTo have an identity is to feel special—to feel alive—to feel whole—to feel worthwhile—to feel potential. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=314))\n\nPeople don’t buy things; they buy the feeling that things give them. They are investing in the building blocks of their own identity, and how this helps creates narratives they can show others. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=315))\n\n**Your audience lives by narratives. This is how they express their identity. They want a narrative that makes sense of the world. It is not just a reflection on the world, but their place within it. It justifies their decisions. It allays their fears. It motivates their hopes.** ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=320))\n\nNarratives define our reality. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=340))\n\nWe live our lives by a narrative. Everything is filtered through it. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=366))\n\n**When you consider how you are a gateway for others, understanding your narrative, understanding theirs, and connecting the two is inherently what you are offering.** ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=374))\n\nMost creative professionals I speak with are nervous about the idea of developing an audience, because they assume it means they will have to become a salesperson who is always “pitching” an offer to people. But that isn’t the goal for them, and it won’t be for you. Instead, **you will be offering people a chance to align with the narratives that engage them.** ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=375))\n\nHow does all of this relate to your creative work—the book, art, craft, song, idea, or business you are creating? It is perhaps the foundation of what it means to be a gateway. You are not creating a “fan,” or a customer. **You are providing someone something much deeper, which is a sense of themselves and the world around them.** ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=389))\n\n**When you understand the narratives your ideal audience seeks, you know how to engage those people.** You know how to grab their attention, you know how to get them to lean in, and to become so enamored that they can’t help but tell their friends. And isn’t that the heart of what creative professionals want? To not just get attention, but change people’s lives and get people talking? It’s more than just “word-of-mouth marketing,” it is the idea that you are truly creating conversations around what you create. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=392))\n\nThis doesn’t happen when you sell based on value or price. It happens when you provide a narrative, and therefore, an identity, that your audience seeks. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=396))\n\nFind and Align Your Narratives ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=398))\n\nYour gateway is a signal to others. This is a guiding focus to provide clarity, not just to others, but to yourself. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=399))\n\nIdentifying your narratives can feel like an impossibly difficult task. It requires a sense of self-awareness that people sometimes avoid. It can feel uncomfortable to analyze yourself. It forces you to confront the fact that the way you see the world is through a filter that makes sense to you personally, but is not the way the world actually is for everyone. ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=401))\n\nEach wakes up with a different narrative in their mind, without realizing that their personal is what shapes it. ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=406))\n\nUnderstanding and communicating your narratives is the next step in crafting your gateway. **To find and align your narratives, I encourage you to identify what matters most to you across your entire life, not just in your creative work.** You have only so many resources of time, energy and money. Too many people fail in their creative work because they don't accept and embrace that. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=407))\n\nWhen you consider the narratives which drive you, it can’t be just for your creative work, it has to be for everything. Why? Because **if you want to succeed in being a gateway for others, you have to hone in on what matters to you more than anything.** ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=411))\n\nThis is where many people fail. They come up with a clever idea for a craft, a book, or a business, and they shove it into an otherwise crowded narrative. It’s “in addition to,” not a core part of what matters most to them. They fail because they care about this idea only insofar as it is clever and represents a lottery ticket in their life. They dream that if their idea takes off quickly, they will invest more of their life in it. What they are hoping for is that if they develop it just barely enough, others will come in and validate the idea, help it spread, and turn it into a movement. In other words, they want quick validation where others make the path to success easier for them. ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=413))\n\nThis rarely happens. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=418))\n\nWhy did this one person succeed? Because they believed in it more. It was more core to their personal narrative of what mattered, and where they could devote their time, energy, and money. The person who succeeded waded through risk long after you would have said, “This is crazy … I’m not wading any further into this.” ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=420))\n\nI want you to **think about what you would fight to not lose. Those are your narratives. This is where you will put your energy every day, every week, and every month. It is where you will keep that flame alive long after others would have given up.** ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=423))\n\nIf you want people to make time to experience your creative vision, then you have to make time to create it. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=428))\n\n**Is there a disconnect between what you do every week versus what you you want to be known for?** ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=429))\n\n**Your narratives are two things:** ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=433))\n\n**1. The things in life that you care so much about that you would fight to protect them, and to ensure that they can reach their full potential.** If they were threatened, you would risk so much to protect them—from not just physical harm, but even stature. You would gladly give up so much else to ensure these things continue to exist. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=433))\n\n**2. A practice. What you do every single day**, every single week, every single month. Slowly, in small steps. You have to ask yourself: do you simply dream of moving ahead with your creative goals, or do you take action on it? Are you full of hot air, even to yourself? ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=436))\n\nHere, we broaden your reasons for why you create. Your narrative is not just “I wrote this book about an underdog; I really hope this book finds an audience.” Your narrative is, “I believe in the underdog, and in my life I champion and look out for those who have the odds stacked against them. I even wrote a novel about an underdog, and I think this story will inspire people to find the strength to not give up.”\n\nThe first example is a product that you likely wouldn’t fight to protect. Sure, you hope it works, you cared enough about it to create it, but if it failed to sell more than thirty books, you would likely drop it and move on to other things.\n\nIn contrast, the second example is a belief that is embodied in the book, but also extends beyond it. This is something you would fight for. Where, if the book failed to sell more than thirty copies, you move onto the next book about an underdog, or brainstorm other creative ways to help inspire others to find strength when they feel hopeless . ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=439))\n\nBe Clear About Your Priorities ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=447))\n\n1.Take out a stack of index cards. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=449))\n\n2.Spend fifteen minutes writing one thing on each card. Have it be a word or phrase of something that matters deeply to you, or that you feel responsible for. This should encapsulate your entire life, not just your writing goals. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=450))\n\n3.Now, sit down on the floor or at a large empty table, and put the items that matter most to you at the top of a pyramid shaped design, and the items that matter less near the bottom. Place the top item in the pyramid flat on the table furthest away from you, and the lower priority items flat on the table closest to you. You will have three to six rows making up your pyramid, with one index card at the top level, two in the next, three in the next, four in the next, and so on. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=453))\n\nWhen you create yours, keep in mind that no one else needs to see it, so play with putting different cards in different places. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=462))\n\nIn fact, I think it can be important to play with different orderings to envision the different ways you can structure your life, and force you to begin thinking about how to do what matters in your life when you have very limited time, energy, and resources. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=463))\n\nThe purpose of this exercise is to find clarity. It is also a way to find connections between the various aspects of your life. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=467))\n\nThis exercise is about making choices about what you care most about, but also thinking about how you can use them to craft the narrative of who you are and what you believe. The gateway you craft begins with who you are. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=477))\n\nCraft a Mission Statement ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=479))\n\nThe goal is to **identify a simple sentence that focuses on the experience you want your writing to create for others.** Please don’t focus on the point of purchase—the marketing pitch as to why someone should buy your book. Instead, I want you to think about someone who purchased and read your book nine months ago. How do you hope it shifted the way they think? When do you hope they remember key scenes or characters? ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=481))\n\noftentimes someone will tell me that the goal of their creative work is simply to “entertain people.” Whenever I hear this, I don’t think they are being honest with what they really hope. In truth, they are hiding behind a pithy statement. If you are merely “entertaining,” then there is no need to have to consider what you or your work represents, and you are off the hook from figuring out how to best communicate that. But when you move past the idea of merely entertaining people, you are left to consider the gateway you are crafting. That can feel like a responsibility. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=485))\n\nIn nearly any book, TV show or movie that is popular, there are deeper reasons that people watch beyond being entertained. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=489))\n\nIf you are a nonfiction writer or memoir writer, it is much easier for you to find that connection between the work itself and how you hope it affects the lives of readers. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=501))\n\n**Nine months after someone reads your book, what do you want them to think quietly in their heads about the world you have opened for them? How does it relate to their life, their identity, their interactions?** ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=503))\n\n**Write down a series of belief statements—things that you feel resonate in your creative work. Sit with them for a week, reviewing them each day.** ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=505))\n\nNone may seem perfect, but **at the end of the week, choose one that you are drawn to the most. Don’t worry, just like paint, you can change it over time.** ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=506))\n\nAs you hone your own mission statement, go find the biggest magic marker you can, and write it in big letters on a piece of paper. Tape it to the wall next to where you write in your home. Now, take a picture of it with your phone. Go into your phone’s settings and make it the wallpaper background to your “home” screen and “lock” screen. I want you to be reminded of your intention all day, every day. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=515))\n\nWe are building your gateway out of steel, not cardboard, and **ensuring that you believe in your gateway with such clarity—such verve—that nothing can shake it.** ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=518))\n\nCraft Your Bio ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=520))\n\nthe way you describe who you are and how your experience makes you the perfect person to write the books you are working on. Your bio may appear on the back of a book, but also on your website, in a query letter to an agent, or even in how you describe your work to someone you just met at a barbecue. **Your bio should embody not just a chronological view of your life, but the narratives that fuel you.** ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=521))\n\n1. **A belief statement that your ideal reader would read and say “YES! This!”** ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=527))\n2. **A description of the one thing you desperately want that reader to care about. (Hint: this should be your creative work.)** ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=528))\n3. **Your credentials as they relate to your creative work.** ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=529))\n4. **Your background and experience. Filter this through your creative work.** ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=530))\n5. **Who you are as a person. This is where your hobbies, where you live, and your background come in. Only after you have hooked us with the narratives that we care about.** ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=531))\n\n**Bio Step #1: Start With a Belief Statement** ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=534))\n\n**Don’t start your biography at the beginning of your life and work forward. Instead, start with the present and work backward.** In other words, don’t focus too much on place, without translating why this matters. Most people have pride in where they come from, and where they have lived. But what they don’t understand is that their internal feeling of pride often doesn’t translate into anything others can relate to. It is a hollow stand-in for what we are trying to say, but aren’t making enough effort. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=535))\n\nCan you include where you live (or have lived) in your bio? Sure. But don’t start with it, end with it. That is information that is only interesting after you have engaged me with other things. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=545))\n\nIn fact, **don’t start with you at all. Instead, start with me.** I know, this seems counterintuitive for a biography, but please hear me out. **If you want me to pause from what I am doing to give you and your work a chance, you have to create a bridge. That bridge is from the things I desperately care about and engage with to what you and your work are about.** This is why the first line of a book is so critical, or the beginning of any work of art. It serves to engage and communicate that the reader isn’t wasting their time. **If your goal is to have someone engage with you, you have to begin with empathy and start with them, not you.** ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=547))\n\n**This can take the form of a belief statement—the things that embody your work and your drive to create that would resonate with your ideal audience. This will be a version of the mission statement you crafted above. It can be what you are fighting for, or what you are fighting against. It can be a feeling that you want people to have when they experience your work. It can be a story that is shorthand for what your audience wants to align with.** ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=553))\n\n**Bio Step #2: Focus on Your Creative Work** ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=557))\n\nNow that you have built a bridge from where your ideal audience is to what your work embodies, tell us about that work. There are two common mistakes I see people make at this stage. The first is (again), people start at the beginning and work their way forward. They tell the reader about their very first forays into their art or craft, and then walk us through it slowly working their way to the present. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=558))\n\nInstead of focusing my attention on the creative work that matters most to them right now, they require me to experience every step of the journey. That is a lot to ask up front. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=562))\n\nThe second mistake people make in this section is to list too many things all at once, as if each has equal importance. They do so because they are trying to represent all of the nuances of what they love and are capable of. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=565))\n\nI want you to **slow down and focus first on the thing that matters to you in your creative work right now.** If it is a memoir, take us through that. Spend two paragraphs on it, don’t shove it into a list with five other things. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=569))\n\n**Bio Step #3: Your Credentials** ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=571))\n\nThis is where you **build the case for why you are the perfect person to be creating the creative work you just described.** Sometimes these credentials are achievements, such as degrees you have earned, or years you have spent in a specific field. But other times, they **align to the narratives and stories we talked about earlier. This can take the form of a story as to how you got into your craft, or why it matters to you.** ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=572))\n\nThese may not seem like traditional credentials that appear on a resume, but they serve the same function; they tell the reader you are the real deal. ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=580))\n\n**Bio Step #4: Your Background and Experience** ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=581))\n\nThis is where you can **go broader into other areas of your life beyond your creative work**: your career, schools you attended, achievements you have earned, and other skills you have. When sharing this, **filter it through your creative work**. This is where you tell us about your day job, but explain how it relates to the creative work you craft. ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=582))\n\n**Bio Step #5: Personal Details** ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=586))\n\nWhile some personal details are infused in everything you would have shared in the previous steps, **this is where you can place anything that didn’t fit.** ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=587))\n\nEnding with the personal stuff allows me to connect with you as an individual after I understand the creative work that you want me to focus on more than anything. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=590))\n\n**Your bio is the centerpiece of the narrative that connects the work you create and who you are.** Other ways to find your narrative? **Consider what you love talking about. What topics could you sit at a cafe or bar and talk about for hours and hours? What types of people do you seek out and enjoy chatting with?** I mean real people, not a mysterious and perfect “audience” that you imagine for your book. **What are common traits of these people, what resonates with you about them, and they with you?** What I want to encourage you to do now is **find engaging ways to describe the practical things you already do,** not write boring phrases that sound “professional” but are just safe ways to hide behind the same staid practices everyone else is using. ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=592))\n\nWhen you sound like everyone else, can you really be surprised that no one notices you? ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=599))\n\nIdentifying your narratives and framing them into the context of your life through a biography is the first step, but now we have to dig deeper. This is the foundation for your gateway: to **know what you stand for, and to share it in a way that truly speaks to others**. ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=600))\n\nCraft Your Gateway ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=602))\n\nA gateway is not a business card, a clever pitch, or a website. **It is how you craft and share your work with others**, not how you schedule promotional status updates on social media that you broadcast out to “an audience.” **Your gateway is a process not unlike your creative work. You will hone it via habits, keen observation, and experimentation.

That when her friend looks at the Etsy shop, she is not seeing art. Rather, she is seeing someone who is working to create something from nothing, to share their voice, and redefine how the world sees them. And that can be personally challenging to her friend.

Few people ever notice their work, it garners very few sales, and little attention. ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=743))\n\n  \n\nSometimes the disappointment is mild; the creator appreciated the journey and feels satisfied that they finished their idea, even if few people ever discovered it. But other times, the disappointment is profound. During the process of preparing to share their work, the creator began banking on the hope that their idea would spread. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=746))\n\n  \n\nTheir hope was that the same passion which created the work would somehow infect others. Its release into the world would not only bring joy to others, but validate the creator themselves and even shift their identity. Such validation would help them “escape” from a role that they may feel trapped in. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=749))\n\n  \n\nThe idea was that success with their creative work could make all of their past roles slip away and force the world to see them as the confident creative geniuses they aspired to be. ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=752))\n\n  \n\nWhen this doesn’t happen, the sense of failure can hit like a brick. They realize that their big idea fell flat, that they are trapped in the same old identity, and that their best effort wasn’t good enough to reach a wide audience quickly. Too often, the effect of their work failing to reach an audience is that the creator stops.

But what I want more for you is that you keep sharing your voice and your vision with new work; that this work, over time, changes the lives of others for the better; that you concurrently develop slow organic growth, but also increase the chances of serendipitous luck that connects your work to even more people.** ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=758))\n\n  \n\nWhere I feel people get off track is when they focus on numbers alone, forgetting about the importance of the effect of their work. They instead rely on stand-ins such as social media followers, downloads, awards, charts and data. They make an assumption that if 4,000 people downloaded their work, it must be having an impact, even if they are unsure of what it is. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=761))\n\n  \n\n**The goal should not be data; the goal should be a demonstrable impact that your work has had on someone’s life.

([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=773))\n\n  \n\nAs adults, we have spent years developing a keen sense of how to create social safety in new situations. We often surround ourselves with safe validation. We stop going to new places and stop putting ourselves in new social contexts. We go to the same places to work and come home to the same family, because these things feel safe. ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=781))\n\n  \n\nWhen it comes time to share our creative work, the high school fears rise up within us. It can feel like that first day all over again, where all of the security of friendships, sense of place, social standing, and validation are wiped away. We feel vulnerable because we are sharing something we care about with the world, and others can reject us.

For instance, the art world was a community of relationships, and artists either engaged directly, or had agents/friends/spouses who engaged on their behalf.

Instead of launching a “brand,” you are simply seeking out small conversations, tiny ways of helping, and having meaningful conversations with people who will care about your vision.** This, as opposed to what so many people in our culture try to encourage you to do: go viral.

But don’t fear, you don’t have to stand on a stage to pitch your ideas to thousands. **This is about individual conversations, small moments, and a combination of sharing and helping, all filled with empathy.

That term translates the moment when someone goes from being a potential buyer (or fan), to someone who takes an action to purchase your work (or follow you). **For your creative work to grow, you have to envision the sale as one milestone in a much bigger process, one where people who buy from you tell others about your work.** That is why there are two layers after “conversion,” where people don’t just buy your creative work, but love it, and seek out other work you create. Where they begin to tell others how wonderful you are and how they need to check out what you create.

The reality is that we are waiting until we feel less afraid, or the world makes it safer with established, accepted practices. We tell ourselves this research is to make “informed choices,” so we delay action. But if you wait for it to be “safe,” that means you are crossing the same street with thousands of others. The rush to “be the first to the other side” has long been won by someone else, and what we find on the other side is that it is crowded. You are merely one of the pack of people simply copying, and therefore receiving, almost none of the original value. ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=883))\n\n  \n\nInstead, you are copying things that thousands of others are copying at the same time, which are often tactics that worked for someone else—once—two years ago, and now delivers a tiny fraction of the value it delivered that one time.

You can put names and faces to them.** ([Location 935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=935))\n    \n\n  \n\n2. **To develop colleagues—others who work in your field, support the type of creative work that you do, connect that work to an audience, and are advocates for it.** ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=937))\n    \n\n  \n\nWhenever I meet a creative professional who truly feels lost in the marketplace, these two things are always missing. The result is that, without truly understanding their ideal audience, they are left chasing anyone who will listen. They begin copying copies of what others are copying because they feel so far removed from someone who may appreciate their work. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=938))\n\n  \n\nThis is how your intended audience feels. They are overwhelmed managing their everyday lives, and are unlikely to make a purchase or become a raving fan because they saw a single Tweet, newsletter, video, or status update rush across their web browser. Doing primary research lays the foundation for capturing the attention of your ideal audience in a way that is sustainable and meaningful. It has many benefits, including: ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=946))\n\n  \n\n- Telling you **what your ideal audience cares about**.\n    \n- Indicating **where they hang out online and off**.\n    \n- Hinting at **what other creative work they love and why**.\n    \n- Identifying **who they admire and listen to**.\n    \n- Being a process original to you.\n    \n- Allowing you to tap into and experience your creative vision in a fuller way.\n    \n- Helping you manage the complex emotions and psychological triggers around creating, sharing, and the business aspect of your work. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=949))\n    \n\n  \n\nWhen you are done, you will have a sense of how to craft your messaging, where you need to be, and who can help connect you to these people you hope to engage. What’s more, the process will align to and support your creative work, not get in the way and eclipse it. **Doing this allows audience outreach to feel meaningful to you, where every time you learn something new about your audience, it fuels a deep sense of momentum.** ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=957))\n\n  \n\nStart With What You Know ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=960))\n\n  \n\n“To achieve greatness, start where you are, use what you have, do what you can.” That is exactly what you are going to do to begin your primary research, **focusing on learning about your ideal audience in the context of your personal creative vision**. The process starts by exploring the ways that comparing your work to others actually helps you gain clarity. ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=961))\n\n  \n\nIt’s far better to know from the beginning why it resonates. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=968))\n\n  \n\n**“finding landmarks.” They are meant to help guide you from where you are to where your audience is.** What I love about this system is that it works in both directions:\n\n  \n\n1. First you will **use landmarks for you to move outward from where you are to understand the marketplace where your creative work will exist, and then, to find your ideal audience**. ([Location 969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=969))\n    \n\n  \n\n2. Then, we will reverse this, **turning the same landmarks into guideposts to leave a trail for people to follow to lead them back to your gateway**. ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=972))\n    \n\n  \n\n**Landmarks are the examples of what you hope your creative work aspires to be like, which your ideal audience knows universally as the best example of the kind of work you do.** What you want to do is **not find landmarks exactly like your creative work, but instead focus on the positive emotions people feel about similar work already, and redirect those emotions and attention to your own creations**. ([Location 974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=974))\n\n  \n\nWhat we are doing is **identifying “comps,”** which some people describe as “comparable work” and others as “competitive work.” They are the **other things in the marketplace that your ideal audience likely already knows, and has some similarities to what you create and why they may love it.** ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=978))\n\n  \n\nThat is the power of the **landmark. It borrows the power of something your audience already knows and loves.** ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=985))\n\n  \n\nDon’t think of this as a way to elevate your work. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=987))\n\n  \n\nThis is where people go wrong. They are so obsessed with convincing other people that their idea is so amazing, if only they would give it a chance, that they are blinded by it. They feel they have no comps, that their work is so unique in the universe that it is incomparable. I call this the “special snowflake syndrome.” I am always telling people that **while they themselves are unique people, their creative work exists in a marketplace where their ideal audience is overwhelmed and is seeking out what they know they like.** ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=990))\n\n  \n\nThey are mistaking what they hope their work becomes with practical ways in which others would consider landmarks as a way to find their work. Instead, flip it—**consider how your audience reacts to the landmarks you identify, and how they can use those to become aware of yours. Use landmarks to help others navigate their way to your gateway.** ([Location 994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=994))\n\n  \n\nBut you can be aware of the themes in your work that align with what readers love. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=999))\n\n  \n\nBe the Gateway is about ensuring you don’t die like Fitzgerald, never knowing your work mattered deeply to people. It is about you **taking control to ensure it reaches the hearts and minds of people**, not hoping that history reviews your work after you are gone. **Even knowing you reached one person on a deep level can radically change the momentum for what you create. When you change someone’s life with your creative work, you create an energy that tends to spread.** ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1004))\n\n  \n\nWe will **use comps to help you understand how your work fits into the lives of your ideal audience, how others would describe it, to use as a model for success, and to begin uncovering the path that leads to your gateway.** ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1007))\n\n  \n\n**Find Five Comparable Works** ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1009))\n\n  \n\nYou want to find five comparable works to your own.

Comps should: ([Location 1012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1012))\n\n  \n\n- Be **released within the past one to five years**. ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1014))\n    \n- Have **some level of public validation, such as reviews, media attention, an audience, distribution, etc.** ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1016))\n    \n- Be **within the same field as the one where you create**.

Begin with Landmarks** ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1020))\n\n  \n\nIf you are unsure of where to begin, **start with the big prominent names in your field—the people who everyone knows. Go to the marketplaces where this work is shared or sold.** I tend to find **online marketplaces that offer customer/consumer feedback to be best**, but I will include in-person options as well. ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1020))\n\n  \n\n- **For books online, go to Amazon or Goodreads.** For physical books, go to libraries or bookstores. ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1023))\n    \n\n  \n\nThen, **begin with the landmark in your field whose work you feel has some relation to yours.** This is not you comparing quality; it is a matter of choosing the same type ([Location 1029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1029))\n\n  \n\n1. Based on your experience, you already know how you or others would identify similar work to what you have created. ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1031))\n    \n\n  \n\n2.

This is the place where you will have to battle the “special snowflake syndrome” the most. Remember that **this landmark exercise is not about defining who you are, but simply understanding how the marketplace categorizes work such as yours.** ([Location 1039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1039))\n\n  \n\n**Don’t confuse the effect you want for your work with how you understand the marketplace, or how it will define your work.** ([Location 1043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1043))\n\n  \n\nWhen they scratch the surface, they are confronted with the idea that there are thousands of people producing work similar to theirs. Or that their work may simply find a place in the middle of the market—([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1048))\n\n  \n\n**2. Find Guideposts** ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1054))\n\n  \n\nFrom here, we can **find the people who have created similar work to you, finding success in the process, but perhaps haven’t had massive breakout hits.** Why do we lower our aim like this? Because **we want more practical examples, instead of someone who won the lottery.** ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1055))\n\n  \n\n**Guideposts help you navigate the marketplace by understanding it better than most others. One by one, they guide you not just to where your work fits within the marketplace, but to the people who would love to hear about what you create.** ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1061))\n\n  \n\nThis step is about the value of primary research. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1063))\n\n  \n\n**Go into Amazon and type in the names of the authors you have identified whose works are landmarks for you, or the names of specific books that you feel are guides. Now, scroll down to the “Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought” section and click on each book. Keep scrolling to see all of the books Amazon displays here**. Amazon provides similar features that may be useful, such as **“What Other Items Do Customers Buy After Viewing This Item?”, “Frequently Bought Together”**, and even **“Sponsored Products Related To This Item.”** ([Location 1064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1064))\n\n  \n\n**As you review these other books, look for those that were published within the past five years, which have some reviews (at least twenty), and most importantly, that you feel resonate with the work you create in some way. None will be perfect. What you are seeking here are general categories and general alignments. Keep clicking on books and reading their descriptions. Keep seeing what categories these books are placed in within Amazon. Write down the names of the books and authors whose work resembles yours in some way; note why that is the case.** ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1069))\n\n  \n\n**You may find after an hour of research that you keep running into the same books again and again on Amazon, and new books they display are in wildly different categories.

We want to know what readers liked about the book, what they didn’t like, and why. Pay very close attention to the language they use. Look for trends in terms of phrases or focus.** ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1083))\n\n  \n\n**For each of the comps you find, identify how others categorize them.** **You can look at the Amazon category rankings** for each book to see how the book is defined within Amazon. This gives you a sense of where it would be placed in a library or on the shelf of a bookstore. This addresses a soft spot for most creators—how to categorize one’s work. ([Location 1104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1104))\n\n  \n\nIt is a shorthand that doesn’t explain the full depth of the work, but acts as a signal to those who may be interested in it.

I love this tool! Let’s say you are trying to determine if you should describe your book as a “psychological thriller” or “suspense.” Or perhaps you are wading through thousands of reviews of comparable books, and trying to figure out what themes pop up again and again in reviews. This search box will help provide the data you need to decide. **After reading through the reviews of a comp, make note of phrases you see again and again, or phrases you are curious to see pop up. Then, type those into the search box and see which occur more frequently.** ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1117))\n\n  \n\nThis is not about writing to an audience, but **understanding how the expectations and desires of a reader do and don’t align to your work. It helps you better present your work to those people and understand why they read it, not just why you wrote it.** ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1126))\n\n  \n\n- **Review “best of” lists each year, but also user-generated lists that are created on sites, such as Amazon for authors** ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1130))\n    \n- **Review how the artist describes their work.

Switch to a Google image search to see what comes up. Then do a Google video search. Don’t stop at the first sign that validates what you already know.

([Location 1160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1160))\n    \n\n  \n\n**Mid-level doers are those in your field who are showing up every day to create more work and connect with more people. If you want to see practical examples of how others define their creative work, craft messaging around it, and identify their audience, then connecting with mid-level doers is your best bet to find out.** What I find is that mid-level doers are an under-appreciated resource in any creative field. **You can begin with the comps you identified in the previous chapters—the people doing work similar to yours, but who have achieved a point of sustainability in their career.** Don’t treat other creators as “competition.” View them instead as like-minded people who share the same passion that you do for this work and how it affects the world.

The podcaster themselves is someone you should focus on because they have made it their job to understand people whose work resonates.

Instead, I want you to do the opposite. I want you to **think of social media as the greatest research tool ever created. This is a place for you to observe and listen intently, and in doing so, better understand the people who will walk through your gateway. Use social media as an input, not an output.**\n\n**Find your mid-level doers on every social media channel you can.**Usually, you can go to their website, and they will provide links to the social media they are active on. The first thing you are doing is **noticing which channels seem to be more popular for your creative field.** ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1176))\n\n  \n\n**Observe which channels the mid-level doers are most active on, and have the most followers on, and then follow them there.** Focusing is a big part of this. Someone may list five social networks on their website, but **you should be able to identify the one or two that really matter to them. Focus on those.** **Don’t just pick the network that you are most comfortable with—hone in on the one that they are most comfortable with**. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1183))\n\n  \n\nI ask that you **begin recognizing the practices that work for those in your field who are dedicated to reaching the audience you hope to engage.** ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1188))\n\n  \n\n**You are following mid-level doers to see who they follow.** ([Location 1189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1189))\n\n  \n\n**See who these mid-level doers mention often in their social media feeds.** ([Location 1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1192))\n\n  \n\nBut you can also **observe any @names that the person mentions again and again in their feeds. Look for names and faces.** ([Location 1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1193))\n\n  \n\nThen **look at who follows these mid-level doers, but also see who mentions them, by searching their @name in the search field for each social network. This gives you a sense of who supports them, with names and faces, as well as their interests**. ([Location 1194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1194))\n\n  \n\n**Give yourself a week or two, and simply listen. Look at every social media update they share.** Don’t look for a simple one-step marketing funnel, where a single Tweet leads to a sale or to going viral. Instead, **focus on the people and what they engage with. Let go of your assumptions and your own narratives here.** The guides you need to follow rely on these channels, and your ideal audience may love it.([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1196))\n\n  \n\n**3. Show Up, Observe, and Ask Questions** ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1200))\n\n  \n\n**Show up to events, and instead of doing what everyone else does—glom onto the big stars and known people—focus your attention on the attendees. Talk to them.**([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1200))\n\n  \n\n**Ask people why they came. Ask about what kind of work they love and why. Ask how they got into this field. Don’t try to impress people, and don’t try to sound too smart or savvy. Whatever you do, don’t promote your own work. Simple questions to the right people almost give you a map to understanding the gateways that got these people into this type of creative work—and understanding their narratives.** ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1203))\n\n  \n\nIt turns out that **everywhere you go—the hospital, the subway—are opportunities for you to understand why people engage with creative work similar to your own. Do so by tapping into their passion, their reason for caring about it.** ([Location 1216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1216))\n\n  \n\nThe key is asking. ([Location 1218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1218))\n\n  \n\nLikewise, **consider reaching out to those mid-level doers you identified. Ask simple questions that you need help with.** **Perhaps it is how that person got started; perhaps you are struggling with something. Be honest with them**—don’t try to convince them of how important you are, and don’t tell them your life story. Ask a simple question in a grateful manner. ([Location 1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1221))\n\n  \n\n**4. Focus on the People Behind the Brands** ([Location 1224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1224))\n\n  \n\n**If there are brands or media that you feel your audience knows and respects, I would encourage you to not think of them as publicity channels for your work, but instead as people with a shared passion.** A magazine is made up of individuals; it is not some monolithic entity. It is the same with any company or organization that you want to better understand or feel connected to. ([Location 1225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1225))\n\n  \n\n**Learn how the organization is structured, how many people are within it, and where they are located. For your specific field, see if there is a subgroup that specializes in it.** ([Location 1228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B01NAVTDXQ\u0026location=1228))\n\n  \n\nWhy do this? Because more often than people would like to admit, **who you know will help drive your career forward.** When you see an author or artist in a magazine, the story behind how they got there is often about relationships. Someone pitched someone; someone knew someone; someone fit a need or preference that a specific editor had. **Stop pitching blindly to “entities” and start understanding these organizations as real groups of multifaceted people, who are just like you.**\n\n  \n\nOne example of how to identify the people behind the brands in publishing is an email newsletter I subscribe to called **Publishers Lunch**. While it focuses on news and deals within the publishing industry, the most interesting part to me is the “People” section. They tell you about people moving in and out of companies. **If you want to have a better sense of how marketing works within a big publisher, look these people up on LinkedIn. No, don’t stalk them, and no, don’t bug them. Simply do research to see what these departments and individuals truly look like.** You may be surprised to learn that a specific organization has a single publicist and a marketing team of two. That could help you set your expectations for how much individualized attention you would get from them.\n\n  \n\n**Too often, a single individual at an organization will become the “face” of it; I would encourage you to focus on the many others who show up there every day. These people are wonderful resources because they care deeply about work similar to yours.**\n\n  \n\nBestselling author Thomas Greanias told me how, before he found success, he would drive to every bookstore he could find up and down the entire coast of California. He slowly built relationships along the way, and came to better understand the needs and preferences of bookstores. What’s more, he knew their faces, names, and personalities, not a vague notion of what booksellers did and why. Perhaps just as important, they knew his. This allowed him to gain a keen understanding of how to position and market his books\n\n  \n\n**5. Use the Least Crowded Channel**\n\n  \n\nDon’t be a wallflower. Find the least crowded channel.\n\n  \n\n**Send an email to mid-level doers** instead of being the 80th person to come up to them after they speak at a conference. **Look for the people who surround the mid-level doer, such as a manager, an assistant, the support staff. If you are attending an event that one of your heroes is putting on, befriend all the people who are working on it.**\n\n  \n\n**If you feel like an outsider to the community you hope to engage, don’t let that stop you.**\n\nthere are stories all around us, waiting to be told. Too often, we miss them because we are afraid to ask—afraid of that moment of awkwardness and the risk of rejection. I encourage you to take that risk.\n\n  \n\n**6. Interview People**\n\n  \n\nJust as stories are all around us, so are the answers you seek about how you can craft and lead people to your gateway. Not by vying to be the billionth person to try to get the attention of an “influencer,” but by **interviewing the mid-level doers, the members of the communities you hope to engage, and the people who are fans of work similar to yours.** **Don’t just follow others on social media—reach out to them. Ask questions and consider doing interviews. I have set up a blog post or podcast episode many times to offer the interviewee some kind of “promotion” for their efforts.**\n\n  \n\n**You can do this via email (send questions, receive back answers), Skype for an online video interview, phone, or meet in person. You can ask other creative professionals about their experiences at book readings; ask about their ten biggest fans; ask about experiences with those who buy their work, what drives them to create, and what is their process to create.**\n\n  \n\nInterviews also help you to develop relationships and grow your own stature within a community.\n\n  \n\nI have had clients who are breaking into new fields by interviewing people within them, and in a very short period of time, they have a wide range of relationships with insiders, as well as the knowledge those people have shared.\n\n  \n\nThis isn’t always only about gaining access to prominent people; **it also helps you understand the needs of your community.**\n\nDon’t assume that by asking people questions, you are bugging them. People enjoy being asked their opinion, especially if they feel it could help others or create a change they would like to see.\n\n  \n\n**Through this process you are creating maps. You are learning the existing paths, the people you need to know, the language your audience understands, and how to use that to connect your work to your ideal audience.**\n\nIf you want to find success, you will find that empathy is a huge theme. The people I see who find success are masters at putting in the time to understand the communities they hope to be a part of. **The core focus here is to consider the people who make up these communities, and create relationships with them.**\n\n  \n\n**Consider not how you can gain the attention of others, but how you can bring joy to them, and develop meaningful connections over time, because what lasts is what you create**, not what you react to. It is the experiences you share and what you attend to each day, with the care of an artisan. The good stuff is created slowly, even as you struggle through the boring parts.\n\n  \n\nCreating your work—your writing, your art, your craft—and connecting it to the world is not just about the act of putting a product out there and publicizing it. It is about providing a gateway for others, being someone who is there when they need to experience joy, when they need to learn, when they need a helping hand, and when they simply need to know that there is hope. **What lasts isn’t instant success, but that inclination to be present for others.** That is what it means to open a gateway for them.\n\n  \n\nOpen the Gate\n\n  \n\nI remember the difference between the romantic fantasy of hoping the work will speak for itself, and the professionals who exhaust all avenues to develop a meaningful connection to their audience. It’s like the difference between someone who builds a gateway versus someone who builds a house deep in the woods, hoping other people invest the time and money to bulldoze brand new trails to try and find it.\n\n  \n\nThe Channels You Should Use to Reach Your Audience\n\n  \n\n**When choosing the channels you invest in to reach your audience, it should be a mixture of online and offline channels, which may include a website, blog, podcast, articles, email newsletters, print media (newspapers, magazines), radio, TV, and of course, social media** channels such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and others.\n\n  \n\nyou want to **use your research to determine the channels where your ideal audience is most engaged. You do not have to choose one strategy or the other—popular channels where your audience engages versus “the least crowded channel.” You should instead use both strategies in different ways, at different times.**\n\n  \n\n**If you are creating a website for yourself, do a survey of ten colleagues to see what their sites look like. Then, for your own, I would encourage you to keep it as simple as possible in terms of both content and design.** I have seen far too many people waste months of time trying to get their website to visually represent their identity. Don’t. **Your website is not you, and when you first begin, consider the most basic things it must do.**\n\n  \n\nIf you spend months designing a website as a destination, you will likely be disappointed when you launch and few people come. Instead, **identify the core things it has to do and include only those. Include as few items on the navigation bar as possible; write in the first person and not in the third person to directly address those who do come**; and please, don’t pretend that your website is a newspaper that has to have dozens of items to try to engage your audience. **Focus their attention, and focus your own goals.**\n\n  \n\n**If you have multiple “brands” to manage, you have to consider if you need more than one website or if they complement each other.**\n\n**Simply be aware whether you are focusing your audience’s attention, or splitting it. It is difficult to be a gateway if you are showing people 100 smaller gates right up front, each leading to 100 different options. Be clear about what the main gateway represents, and why they would want to enter.**\n\n  \n\n**Consider whether you will create long-form content.**\n\n  \n\nThis content can be unique from your creative work itself.\n\n  \n\nEmail newsletters are a way to directly reach out to those who want to hear from you. Consider the difference between a blog and an email newsletter as “pull” versus “push.” With “pull,” you are hoping to pull your audience back to your blog again and again. You are relying on them remembering to come back via a bookmark, RSS feed, or some other manner.\n\n  \n\nThis is why email newsletters are a nice way to “push” your content out to those who choose to receive it. They receive an email the exact moment you want them to, and they can choose whether to look at it or not. Has email become an incredibly crowded channel where many others are vying for attention? Yes. But email still works, and for businesses, email converts—meaning that many brands rely on email to drive a huge portion of their business.\n\n  \n\nSocial media channels can be used for many things. You can share your content, aggregate content from others, post status updates on what you are doing (professionally or personally) and, of course, directly engage with others.\n\n  \n\nThis is not to say that you should simply think of social media as publicity. Too many people fail at social media because they immediately want to spread their message and ensure it is heard.\n\n  \n\nWhen it comes to social media, don’t be Frank. **Don’t just constantly share updates about your services and intrude on others’ lives. Instead, use social media meaningfully. Engage in real conversations, showcase your purpose and your process, and celebrate others who care about the same type of work you do.** Do you need to use any of these channels? No. You can be a successful creative professional without “needing” to do any of these.\n\n  \n\nThe goal of research is to challenge your assumptions. Can you be contrarian and say, “Dan, social media doesn’t work for my field, therefore I am ignoring it”? Sure. But if you are going to be contrarian, all I ask is that you do it with vigor. **Don’t be a contrarian as a way to get out of doing work, but as a way to focus your work.** For example, let’s say you reject the idea of using Instagram to connect with your ideal audience, even if everyone else in your field seems to use it. That is fine. But identify what you replace it with. How do you meaningfully share and connect with those people you hope to reach? Perhaps you instead want to send out handcrafted, printed fanzines (little magazines that are printed at home or a copy store). That’s great! Do it all the way—do it better than anyone.\n\n  \n\nThe Messaging That Represents Your Voice\n\n  \n\nThis is a filter. You are measuring what you share and what you don’t, and how you do so. Doing so with your gateway is similar—**honing the channels, messaging, and manner by which you share and engage with others.**\n\n  \n\nYes, you can **focus on topics that you uncovered in the research earlier in this chapter, but also focus on the feelings that you give people.** This is something that people who are amazing on social media do well, especially those who seem to “break the rules.” **They understand the feelings people want to have by following them, and they are able to be inventive about doing so. Communicating the power of your creative work is something your gateway provides.**\n\n**To have people understand your work, you will need to become a student of those you hope to reach. This is not about writing to an audience, but simply understanding what works when communicating and what doesn’t.**\n\n  \n\n**When sharing the message of your gateway, be curious about other people. Generosity—with your time and attention, your talent and your enthusiasm—is a core way to engage others. If you do something such as an email newsletter, use it to tell other people’s stories as it relates to your vision, not just your own experience.** Being the gateway means that you are not sharing the same TED talk that thousands of others have, but instead, you are **telling stories that are hidden gems.**\n\n  \n\nInvite People to Engage\n\n  \n\n**consider the variety of actions you want people to take, and how that relates to your gateway.**\n\n  \n\n“Stop thinking about art works as objects, and start thinking about them as triggers for experiences.”\n\n  \n\nConsider the variety of actions people can engage in that leads them to, and through, your gateway. All of this creates an experience that captures your ideal audience, and inspires them to create word-of-mouth marketing. What is the easy “way in” to your gateway?\n\n  \n\nConsider how people engage with you beyond buying your stuff. What actions can they take after they buy your stuff?\n\n  \n\nSection 3: Walk People Through the Gate\n\n  \n\nShare the Journey\n\n  \n\n**Don’t wait for people to find and walk through your gateway on their own. Instead, one by one, bring people to your gateway and assist them in walking through it.** To me, this idea is what separates those who dream from those who take action. Would it be nice to “go viral” and have people discover and walk through your gateway on their own? Yes it would, but that is not how we begin. Whenever I see someone who has tried and failed to engage others, it is often because they waited for these people to come, without seeking them out and helping them walk through their gateway.\n\n  \n\nYour goal is not to be a street hustler, distracting someone with a magic trick so that before they know it, you’ve swindled them into buying something from you. **When you build your gateway and walk someone through it, you are creating a fulfilling experience that provides long-term value.**\n\n  \n\nThe process of walking people through the gate is similar to how someone will experience your work. They measure the value not in the transaction of purchasing it, but in the experience of making it a part of their life. You crafted it with a vision, and they integrate it into their life in a way that extends that creative process.\n\n  \n\nIn other words, **walking someone through your gate should not feel as though you have now become a “marketer” instead of a creator. It is about extending the experience of your creative work to at least one person in a meaningful way.**\n\n  \n\nCommunicating Your Journey\n\n  \n\nThe act of creation is sometimes a lonely process. But the act of sharing your work should not be. **Sharing should be a process that involves others: one that is social, and one that feels as natural as a conversation with a close friend.** When you talk to a friend, do you tell them again and again about something you created, and how amazing it is? Likely not. Instead, you **tell them about your process, what motivated you, the roadblocks, and so much else about what drives you. In communicating your journey, you open your friend up to the world of your creative work, and it encourages them to feel a part of your journey. The result is that they become advocates for what you do, and they forge new paths to help others reach your gateway. On these same paths, they will walk one of their other friends through the gate. And that friend will do the same with someone else.**\n\n  \n\nI have heard many others say that the most powerful form of marketing is word-of-mouth marketing, meaning that the most powerful way to drive sales or awareness of something is by a friend telling a friend. I believe this to be true as well. Why? Because there is a high trust factor between friends, and the communication likely happens at exactly the right time that the person needs it.\n\n  \n\n**Sharing the journey is about developing advocates around your creative work that lead to word-of-mouth marketing.** It also feels amazing, because you develop connections with people who appreciate what you do and why you do it. Walking people through the gate is the practice of engaging others with your creative work.\n\n  \n\nSharing is Engaging\n\n  \n\nIf **the most important part of your gateway is your creative work**, I want you to consider **the second most important part to be the people who share your enthusiasm for the same kind of work that you craft.**\n\n  \n\nWhat that means is that **these people who share your enthusiasm are more important than all the following things:**\n\n  \n\n1. **You—your ego and identity.** I have seen many creative professionals who have such a desire for validation, a need for a sense of pride in what they have created, that they feel sharing online is their “one chance” to finally shine. So **they act with less generosity. They focus too much on promoting their own work** (again and again), not just because of ego, but out of a feeling that they have invested years of effort to have reached this point. They are convinced that this is their one moment to not blow it. Are “ego,” “pride,” or “external validation” bad things? No! They are fine. All I’m asking is that you **balance them with sharing a sense of enthusiasm that engages your ideal audience.**\n    \n2. **Clever marketing ideas.**\n    \n3. **Things you paid for that represent your work.** There are two sides of this coin. First, way too much time is wasted in creating these things. Why do people insist on making them? Because it makes them feel professional. Let’s say an artist hires a web designer to create a “home for their artwork on the web.” Quickly, this comes to represent everything about how they feel about their work, and how this website represents who they truly are. They spend months getting this designed, and because they paid a lot of money for it, they have high expectations for how it should work on their behalf to drive engagement with an audience. It usually doesn’t work, because **it’s not one of the two most important things in the creative process. It’s not the creative work itself and it’s not the experience that work creates for an ideal audience.**\n    \n4. **The image you have painstakingly crafted.** In an effort to feel a sense of validation, many creative professionals craft a “brand” surrounding their creative work. It can include some of the things above, but can include so much else, including how they describe their work—the descriptions, biographies, descriptions, taglines, etc.—that elevate the importance they feel it deserves. Then, they hide behind this. The problem I find is that **it creates a distance between the creator and those they hope to engage. The artist can no longer share with their ideal audience because they are too busy trying to seem distant and professional. They write their biography in the third person because it sounds bigger; they only share positive news, not proper status updates that share the reality of how complex their lives are; they don’t show enthusiasm for other people’s work because they feel it diminishes their own importance; they can’t show their actual process, because they fear doing so will show the “little man behind the curtain.”**\n    \n5. **Your social media numbers, or numbers at all.** They begin focusing on gaining more followers instead of really engaging those they already have. **With your creative work, what matters is the work itself, how you have grown as a person as you develop your craft, and how your work affects the lives of others.** To walk people through your gate, consider how you can give people a way in to it.\n    \n\n  \n\n**The Four S Process**\n\n  \n\nThe way to venture out in the world is a system I call the Four S Process. If your work is meant to give people hope, for example, you can:\n\n1. **Seek out others.** Identify places where people tend to look for signs of hope, and where they hang out online and off.\n    \n2. **Signal to others that you are like them, and are welcoming a chance to engage.** This indication can be your demeanor, a sense of shared interests, facial expressions, or how you speak.\n    \n3. **Share things that represent hope.** Perhaps you talk about who inspires you and why.\n    \n4. **Shape conversations by asking questions.** Take a small action to help or engage.\n    \n\n  \n\nBe the one who gives instead of takes, who asks about them first instead of rushing to tell them about yourself.\n\n  \n\nSeale’s Four S Process\n\n  \n\n**When seeking examples to help guide you, the question you want to ask yourself is, “Who is doing work that matters and is succeeding at it?”**\n\n  \n\nSeek Out Others\n\n  \n\nEmbrace others who craft similar work as you, or share enthusiasm for it. Don’t think of others in your field as competitors. Instead, think of them as collaborators.\n\n  \n\nembrace the idea that **the more your colleagues succeed, the greater the chances you have to succeed. Instead of feeling envy or jealousy of others, I would encourage you to overwhelm them with kindness. Interview them, promote their work, and befriend them**, because they are not what will hold you back. Too often, **what holds a creative professional back is their own inability to forge the relationships they need within the field in which they work. These people know your ideal audience, and that audience knows them. Invest in those relationships.**\n\n  \n\nseek out those who share an enthusiasm for this type of work.\n\n  \n\n- If you are an author, **seek out other authors who write in the same topic or genre as you do. Show up to their events, email them, support their work. Be curious about their readers. Ask them questions about what they love and why.**\n    \n\n  \n\nIn other words, the people you hope to engage with are all around you. Don’t wait for them to find you—be perceptive and seek them out.\n\n  \n\nSignal to Others That You Are Like Them\n\n  \n\nConsider the emotions your ideal audience wants to experience. Appealing to people’s emotions is a very effective way to grab their attention and hold it. This process begins with empathy. Focus on a range of emotions someone can feel around your creative work,\n\n  \n\n**The emotions that drive you, the experience others have with your work, and the change you hope your work makes in the world are the signals that you put out in the world.**\n\n  \n\nshare the emotion you want others to feel when they experience your work. This practice focuses on experiences, not “things.”\n\n  \n\nNote that these do not need to be positive emotions.\n\n  \n\nthe emotions your work evokes do not always need to be “joy,” or “inspiration,” or “thoughtfulness.” Emotions of any kind act as a signal and give people a way in.\n\n  \n\nShare Your Enthusiasm and Creative Process\n\n  \n\n**Deconstruct why the type of work you create is special and take people behind the scenes to show how it is done.** Doing so helps them appreciate the craft and provides you another way to engage people.\n\n  \n\n**This also allows people to feel that they are a part of the process of creating something.**\n\n  \n\nIn your creative work, **share the process, the materials, the milestones, and educate them on the elements of what makes incredible work.**\n\n  \n\nLikewise, you can **share what drives you on a deeper level.**\n\n  \n\nThese are motivations and processes that people can relate to and find a connection to.\n\n  \n\nShape Conversations by Asking Questions\n\n  \n\nI find that those who are successful tend to be curious. They ask questions that others overlook, and by doing so, they discover meaning where others do not. **Be curious about those you meet** as you work through the Four S Process. **The most effective way for you to engage with others is to have a keen sense of empathy, to learn about what drives them, and to craft conversations that connect this to your own drive and creative work.**\n\n  \n\n**Find Models Outside of Your Own Field**\n\n**look for people whose work you admire who also share behind-the-scenes examples of how they have grown their career.** It’s not that you want to copy them, but rather that **they can help inspire and illustrate the practical ways that success happens.** The trick, though, is to look outside of your own field. When you only look within your field, you find that people tend to emulate the same strategies and tactics. **When you look outside of your field, you find new ideas that would feel refreshing to your ideal audience.**\n\n  \n\n**Focus on Individuals, Not an “Audience”**\n\nWe dream of having “an audience.” But in doing so, we can diminish the experience of the individual who appreciates our work. We overlook them because we are so focused on building a crowd around our work. Crowds are made of people, and they often begin with one or two advocates drawing others over to see what is so special about what you have created.\n\n  \n\n**Instead of “audience building,” focus on one person at a time.**\n\n  \n\n**generosity is a core part of word-of-mouth marketing.**\n\n  \n\nWhy would you say that? Because it inherently feels validating when you have millions of fans, and once you are validated, you think that then you will have the wherewithal to give back and be generous? I challenge that kind of thinking. I contend that **you need to develop those practices now. You need to look at those sixty people and not wish it was 160 or 1,600, but appreciate them and their connection to your work.**\n\nMy point is, **if you have sixty followers, treat them like the most special people in the world. They are the foundation for how your work will reach more people, and impact the world.**\n\n  \n\nCreate Experiences, not Data\n\n  \n\n“Frustration stems from focusing on what we don’t have. The antidote is appreciating what’s already here.”—Leo Babauta\n\n  \n\n**Build your audience one person at a time. Do so by connecting with others long before you feel you are ready to “launch” your work.**\n\n  \n\nInstead of waiting, bring people along for the journey. Not only will it help you establish and grow an audience now, it will become the engine for word-of-mouth marketing down the road.\n\n  \n\nHere are some practical ideas to get started valuing the audience you have, no matter how small:\n\n  \n\n- **Connect with one new person per week. Take them out to lunch, email them, or set up a phone call.**\n    \n- If you have an audience of any sort, focus on engaging more with the top ten percent, those who seem to be more supportive. Put more effort here than you do into worrying about attracting new people.\n    \n- **Send an email to a colleague—a mid-level doer who practices the same craft you do—and thank them for how their work inspired you.**\n    \n- **Interview those who do what you would love to do. You can ask them everything you ever worried about in your own work, but also share the interview to promote them and become aligned with them publicly.**\n    \n\n  \n\n**When you focus on the depth of connection first, you craft experiences, relationships, and memories that lead to a sense of fulfillment around your creative work.** This is priceless when compared to trying to “game the system,” seeking out artificial ways to boost social media metrics.\n\n  \n\n**Develop a Support System**\n\n  \n\nI encourage you to **seek out others who can assist you and create processes for them to do so.** In other words, create a support system to join you on your journey. First **identify collaborators**, those who will help you in your process of bringing your work to the world.\n\n  \n\nyour work will spread because of those with whom you share your journey. Relationships are a major part of success,\n\n  \n\nrelationships are about trust and understanding. **When you surround yourself with people who understand your work and trust you as a person, you are creating powerful forces to ensure your creative vision spreads.**\n\n  \n\nSurrounding yourself with those who can support your work and support you as a person when you are unsure of the path forward can be a critical stepping stone from uncertainty to success. These people act as your support. Sometimes that is in directly supporting your work, but other times, it is supporting your own uncertainty and doubt.\n\n  \n\n**What is the biggest thing that will keep your work from being created, discovered, and appreciated? You.** You are the most dangerous force that will stop your work from reaching others. You will stop too soon. You will get distracted. You will try, and fail, and then give up. You will be convinced that a different idea is better; then another; then another; constantly hopping from one idea to the next. You will tell yourself that success wasn’t meant for you; you will become bitter that others had a leg up.\n\n  \n\n**Build the support system you need to ensure your creative work reaches others by embracing collaborators. Consider how each person you connect with becomes a collaborator—someone who is part of your creative process.** Types of collaborators to consider:\n\n- Those who connect with your ideal audience every day.\n    \n- Those who share similar goals to yours.\n    \n- Those who share different, but complementary goals.\n    \n- Those who can help you be social.\n    \n- Those who help you do the work you don’t want to do (create graphics, schedule updates, edit blog posts).\n    \n- Those who help you establish a more effective creative process.\n    \n- Those who help you communicate more effectively.\n    \n- Those who can help you brainstorm marketing ideas.\n    \n- Those who can help you balance your time and energy.\n    \n- Those who can help you manage the financial aspects of your creative work.\n    \n\n  \n\nFinding collaborators is key to making creative work sustainable.\n\n  \n\n**For collaborators, start small but intentional.** You don’t even need to hire these collaborators as you begin. **Many of the most powerful collaborators you have are not those you will pay. You simply need someone who can be a sounding board when you have questions, and keep you on track and accountable. The key to this is not having the expectation that the collaborator can magically fix everything. If you want someone to help answer questions, you have to be clear and concise in what you ask, and you have to actually be willing to act on that person’s advice. If you want someone to keep you accountable, you have to illustrate to them that you will do the work, even in the moments they aren’t prodding you.** In other words, don’t punish the person for being a collaborator by having unrealistic expectations of their role.\n\n  \n\n**1. Find Mentors**\n\n  \n\nThese can be **formal or informal** relationships. You could approach people who you respect or are successful in your field and ask to **shadow them, apprentice with them, or meet once per month** for them to share advice. Or you could consider informal mentorships. **Identifying people in your life who you can check in with on a regular basis, but without them having to agree to officially be a mentor for you.**\n\n  \n\nYou may have people you interviewed (if you conducted some of the steps from previous chapters) who might be willing to let you ask some follow-up questions about your own work. **Send them an update email once per month, where you tell them how you are acting on their advice and thank them for their help. For every second email, ask a simple question that you could use their input on.**\n\n  \n\nWouldn’t it feel nice to receive an email from someone who indicates that you are wise; that you have helped shape their life in a profound way; and that your advice is, every day, improving them further? These are the kinds of notes people dream about receiving: not someone just sucking more of their resources, but indicating that their work has had an impact on the world. **The key difference is the tone of your communication.** If you reach out to someone who is prominent in your field and ask them to spend an hour having lunch with you so you can “pick their brain,” then I would agree that this is a lopsided value proposition for that person. They are likely surrounded with people who want their time and attention. But **what if you are the person who asks nothing, but gives quite a bit? What if the small things you do ask for are framed in a way that illustrates the impact that they will make?**\n\nPodcasts have seen a renaissance in the past few years, and one popular form is the **interview podcast**. Here, the podcaster brings guests on the show and spends the entire episode asking them questions. **This has been a key way for someone who has no standing with a community to gain recognition and connections, by aligning with those more prominent than they are, and because of the relationships that are formed in the process, they develop a powerful network of people in the field.**\n\n1. He developed his public voice and following, one episode at a time.\n    \n2. He learned and learned and learned by asking questions.\n    \n3. He developed a powerful network of colleagues.\n    \n\n  \n\n**2. Establish a Mastermind Group**\n\n  \n\nit is a group of people who help encourage and support each other’s goals and daily creative practices. I have been a member of quite a few mastermind groups, and I will take you through three ways they can be structured.\n\n  \n\n**Small group mastermind.** The rules were simple. **Each person was allocated one-fourth of the call (20-30 minutes) to tell the group about a specific challenge they had or a goal they were working toward. The rest of their time was spent brainstorming ideas and ways of helping them navigate.**\n\n  \n\n**One-on-one mastermind.** The small group can be remixed as needed. I am part of another mastermind that involved only one other person; we **speak weekly via the phone, and devote one call to her challenges and one to mine.**\n\n  \n\n**Managed mastermind group.** This is where **one person acts as the leader of the group and actively manages the group by giving prompts, sharing ideas, and encouraging collaboration.** I have run many of these, usually with ten people per mastermind. There are similarities to the small group mastermind in that the **members come from different creative fields, have different goals, and are asked to hone in on specific challenges and goals they need assistance with.** I typically **run these groups entirely online using a group chat program and videos.** The **members have the ability to chat and post updates 24/7**; because of this, I was amazed at how many friendships formed within the group, and how as a whole, it became a tight support group.\n\n  \n\nThere are many other ways to engage in mastermind groups. They can have more structure and a greater commitment to take specific types of actions each week. They can be more actively managed or more fluid.\n\n  \n\nThere are many other ways to identify collaborators, including hiring help, such as consultants, coaches, part-time staff, or interns.\n\n  \n\nHow can collaborators, mentors, and masterminds help you walk people through your gate? Three ways:\n\n1. By **helping you better understand those you want to reach and how to effectively communicate and engage with those people**.\n    \n2. By **telling you practical stories of what did and didn’t work for them.**\n    \n3. By **allowing you to gain perspective from another person of how they interpret the messages and work you are crafting.**\n    \n\n  \n\nFind people that do, and identify ways to collaborate with them. Learn from them, and vet your ideas through them. Become a student of this process, and ensure that you are doing field research.\n\n  \n\nyou need to **establish a sense of empathy for what that experience is like, which will result in you making many small adjustments to ensure it truly engages others. Creative work fails to find an audience when the creator assumes a specific intrinsic value within it that their ideal audience is never able to see or experience because the creator didn’t make it clear to them. Walking someone through the gate is a process of helping others experience your work, by having empathy with how they see the world.**\n\n  \n\nFear is Your Biggest Barrier\n\n  \n\nBut the real barrier is fear. We resist stepping out of our comfort zones to connect with others who can help us share our creative work and develop our audience.\n\n  \n\n“You cannot let a fear of failure, or a fear of comparison, or a fear of judgment stop you from doing what’s going to make you great. You cannot succeed without the risk of failure. You cannot have a voice without the risk of criticism.\n\n  \n\nPeople will tell you to do what makes you happy, but a lot of this has been hard work, and I’m not always happy. I think you should do what makes you great. Do what is uncomfortable, and scary, and hard, but pays off in the long run. You don’t have to be fearless, just don’t let it stop you.\"\n\n  \n\nThe idea of forging relationships with collaborators can be off-putting for many creative professionals for three reasons:\n\n1. **Hiding your creative ideas, because you feel this is the foundation of your identity.**\n    \n2. **Fear of losing control of your creative work.**\n    \n3. **Social fear.**\n    \n\n  \n\nBarrier #1: Hiding Your Creative Ideas\n\n  \n\nOftentimes, their creative work can be the only thing that provides them an identity they are truly proud of, that feels like their own true expression of who they are and what they are capable of. The idea of involving others who are collaborators threatens that identity, because suddenly they fear that by sharing it, others will corrupt it. They love the validation that comes from their work and the image that it is a true expression of who they are. The moment that they involve others, they fear the work may no longer be their own. They want this to elevate their sense of personal identity, not lessen it.\n\n  \n\nWhen will these people welcome collaborators? When the stature of those collaborators raises their own identity.\n\n  \n\nBut when we seek this type of validation—from a publisher, gallery, record label, or others—there is a cost. You are welcoming dozens of collaborators into your process, few of whom you will ever meet. They will shape your work, and in many cases, they will outright own your work.\n\n  \n\nThis is why I am encouraging you to **embrace collaborators early in your process so you can learn what truly engages an audience. The day you sign with an agent, a publisher, or a label is not the culmination of your work, but a core part of how you communicate your work to others.**\n\n  \n\nBarrier #2: Fear of Losing Control of Your Creative Work\n\n  \n\n**don’t confuse your idea with the execution of the idea.**\n\n  \n\nBarrier #3: Social Fear\n\n  \n\nI found, however, that when I hosted a party, there were ways I could navigate around all of my anxieties which allowed me to be very social in ways that made me comfortable. For instance, everyone at the party would be someone I knew, or someone who was a guest in my home. I had a relation to everyone because of this. Because I was the host, I had a job to do, which kept me busy; I couldn’t experience social anxiety when I was busy. I could easily talk to anyone at the party because I could ask if they needed anything and introduce people to each other. I never had that moment of loneliness of being a wallflower, because I stayed busy ensuring the party was running smoothly. It turned out **my challenge wasn’t that I couldn’t engage with people; it was that I needed a safe context to do so, and one that had a structure to it.** What’s more, I actually enjoyed being social in this other context.\n\n  \n\n**To help people walk through your gateway, experiment with ways to make the social aspects of this fun and reduce the amount of anxiety you may feel.** The stories you tell, the experiences you craft, the moments you share—this is your gateway. Not the number of Twitter followers you have. **To see your gateway in action, walk people through it, one by one.** In practical terms, this is all about **developing simple practices of reaching out and having simple conversations using what you have.**\n\n  \n\nWalk Someone Through the Gate\n\n  \n\n**Walking someone through your gate is a process of finding out who that person is, what drives them, and how your gateway aligns with their own path. Don’t assume that once you have crafted your beautiful gateway and the realm that lies beyond it, people can actually reach it.** This is where creative professionals go wrong. They assume too much:\n\n1. That the signs leading to their gateway are clear and engaging.\n    \n2. That the travelers are looking for what they offer beyond their gateway.\n    \n3. That the paths to it are not blocked.\n    \n4. That there is nothing along these paths that would make people apprehensive.\n    \n5. That these people have everything they need to take this journey on their own.\n    \n\n  \n\nTo find out is a process of challenging your assumptions, but this is not some academic exercise. Instead, **you are going to have to walk people again and again down the path that leads to your gateway. By doing this, you will learn new things about what motivates those you hope to engage, and you will learn where your “strategy” for engaging others with your work was, in fact, you being willfully ignorant of the gap between your intention and the needs or desires of those you hope to engage.**\n\n  \n\n**Finding Out #1: Experiment Strategically**\n\n  \n\nAs a creative professional who hopes to engage a wider audience, you are likely **always hunting for aspects of your work that capture the interest of others**. Sometimes it is in the way you describe your work; other times you may **adjust the work itself based on feedback from your audience**.\n\n  \n\nyou are **observing what resonates, and changing your behavior to encourage others to engage with your work** as well.\n\n  \n\nI didn’t just come up with an idea that I thought was clever and decide that it should be a book. I **kept engaging and sharing with my ideal audience, and listened to what resonated. When I found something, I kept exploring it and growing it.** It was a process of **finding out, not assuming.** I did so across **multiple channels: my private mastermind, video, blog, email newsletter, webinar, interviews, private emails, and private phone calls.** Why? Because all of these channels connected me with other people, which is what matters more than the channel itself. Too often, a creative professional will ask **what social media channel they should focus on. My answer is simply the one that allows you to connect meaningfully with real people.** And in truth, that means you should **use a wide range of communication channels and methods, not just one social network.**\n\n  \n\n- **Creating and distributing flyers ahead of time** to parents, so they can order the books.\n    \n- **Donating a portion of the profit from each book sold to the local library.**\n    \n- **Giving away copies** to the teachers for their classrooms.\n    \n- **Taking out ads in the local newspaper.**\n    \n- **Creating, printing, and hanging posters in local stores**.\n    \n- Buying something fun to give to the kids, which she works into her presentation.\n    \n\n  \n\nBecause she is doubling down on the opportunities she does have instead of doing nothing and “waiting to see” if anything magically happens at her events without her making much effort. Do you need to do all of this? Absolutely not. But I would encourage you to **view opportunities to engage others with your work as experiences you craft, and as a way for you to learn more about who you are hoping to capture and what drives them. Identify ways to experiment to find out what works. Put yourself in the position to have to ask your ideal audience what drives them, or find ways to observe them in action.**\n\n  \n\nIf you are an author wondering if **book readings** are an opportunity for you, consider doing the following:\n\n  \n\n- **Watch five videos per day of author events on YouTube**. There are untold thousands of these. **Notice what the author does and what the audience does. What works and what doesn’t.**\n    \n- **Email five authors who recently went on book tours and ask them three short questions via email.**\n    \n- **Call ten bookstores. Ask them about how their author events work and what makes a great one. If they don’t do author events, ask them why and what drove this decision.**\n    \n- **Identify three authors who are currently on tour, and observe their social media during that time.** Look for their own updates on Twitter and anyone who mentions their name. Look for videos uploaded to YouTube or photos shared to Instagram.\n    \n\n  \n\nThen, **experiment for your own work.** You don’t have to convince a bookstore to give you a reading in order to do this; perhaps your first book isn’t even published yet. Instead, **hold a literary salon in your living room, at the local library, or as part of a local organization. Don’t worry about promoting your own work.** Instead, **experiment with what creates an event that attracts and engages people interested in books similar to yours.** You can go back through the many examples in this book to help it get off the ground, such as identify collaborators and co-hosts.\n\n  \n\nIf you dream of speaking to audiences, don’t wait until you are “big enough” to hold your first event. Do it now. Do it consistently. **Learn more about what works and what engages your ideal audience by conducting many experiments.**\n\n  \n\n**Finding Out #2: Start Small, and  Grow as You Learn**\n\n  \n\nStart with one thing. Focus on one question you are asking, and take a single action each week.\n\n  \n\n**Put yourself in the position to show up and observe. Begin asking questions.**\n\n  \n\nThe goal is not to launch a campaign, but to identify one person you can help.\n\n  \n\nLearn from this experience, then iterate.\n\n  \n\n**When you walk a single person through your gateway, you learn so much about their needs, desires, and preferences, and how they relate to your creative work. Perhaps you learn fifty percent of what you need to know to forge new paths to your gateway. Then, walk a second person through, again doing so with empathy and care. Really pay attention to them. Double down on these people—don’t look past the individual because you are so focused on engaging “an audience.” Invest in the people who are right in front of you and who are interested in your work.**\n\n  \n\n**As you walk people one at a time through your gateway, you are more firmly establishing the path to it.**\n\n  \n\n**Finding Out #3: Create Experiences, Not Content**\n\n  \n\n**Your goal in this process is not to build some big “launch,” but rather, to change one person’s life with your creative work right now by crafting meaningful experiences.** Too many creative professionals are blinded by this idea of a big launch, where one day they wake up and go from having no audience to going viral. This often revolves around them focusing on content alone. **While writing an article, creating a podcast, or creating a social media strategy may feel like “audience engagement,” it isn’t.** Sure, they can be a part of the process, but too many people use them as stand-ins for actual engagement. Instead, **focus on creating experiences.** Creating a blog post that you hope leads to someone reading it and maybe even clicking the “like” button for it isn’t true audience engagement. **Seek out conversations and connections with individuals—something that is specific and truly social. It takes effort to create experiences. Too often, we hide behind the safety of content.**\n\n  \n\nfocus more on the experience you create for others and less on simply providing content. **What experiences can you create around your gateway?**\n\n  \n\nEvery day you have this opportunity. Instead of re-sharing the same links as everyone else on social media, instead of sending the same boring “professional” emails, **why not be ludicrously kind and generous to those who support your creative work or creative work like yours?**\n\n  \n\nIf you are worried that this sounds crazy, put a safe boundary on it. Tell yourself that you will **send one generous email per week for a month, a season, or a year.**\n\n  \n\n**Consider how you can give back to specific people in a huge way.** Not Tweet about their book, but do something bigger. **Create an experience and do it really well. Crazy well. The return on investment should be lopsidedly bad. Invest way more than you think you should.**\n\n  \n\nsuccess happens, not by tricking people into discovering and buying your work, but by creating experiences that people remember and doing so on a human level.\n\n  \n\nLiving on Both Sides of the Gateway\n\n  \n\nYou are a gateway. **The creative work you share, the way people discover it, and the interactions with you become the threshold someone moves through in order to be opened up to new experiences, new ways of seeing, and new possibilities. Consider the paths and conversations that lead people to your gateway, and the experiences you share once they move through it.**\n\nI encourage you to **understand this as a human process**, to **have empathy for those you hope to engage**, and in doing so, not just sell them more work, but truly **create advocates in the process**. When you **connect the drive you have for what you create and the drive that motivates your ideal audience**, you can **help them walk through your gate and open up the possibilities you have created in your work**.\n\n## References",

    "content": "\nThe idea of a day job arises from this tension between the exchange economy and the gift economy that artists contend with on a daily basis. This tension  was best articulated in the book [[the gift - hyde]]. Since some if not all of an artist's best ideas are not always immediately profitable, he needs to have a source of income that supports him financially while providing the freedom he needs to experiment on his ideas. Enter the concept of the day job.\n\n## Some ideas on what constitutes a good day job\n\nAccording to Margaret Lobensteine in her book *The Renaissance Soul*, a good day job, which she calls J-O-B, should have two to three of the following five criteria:\n\n1. Provides income and benefits\n2. Conserves your energy for your \"real\" work\n3. Saves or frees time that you can use for your \"real\" work\n4. Access to training and equipment\n5. Provides networking and publicity opportunities to advance your real work\n\nIn his book *Overlap*, Sean McCabe advocates the thesis that an artist should never compromise his main craft or vocation by prematurely making money out of it or sucking the energy and time needed to nurture it. Because of this belief, he sets out the following ideas about what consitutes a good day job:\n\n- A good day job should cover 100 percent of the artist's bills.\n- A good day job should be in a different industry from the artist's vocation to avoid tempting the artist to invest more into it than his vocation and original creative vision.\n- An excellent day job should make you feel excited and charged to pursue your vocation, not drain you.\n- A day job should not be the place to grow your vocation.\n- A day job should not be excessively lucrative so as to prevent you from quitting it even if it is terrible.\n- You should avoid making it too hard to leave a terrible but lucrative day job just because you live excessively luxuriously.\n- Remember your priorities. Your vocation is more important than your day job. Do not invest the same energy and time that you invest in your vocation to your day job.\n- A day job doesn't have to be your favorite thing but you shouldn't hate it (i.e., it doesn't drain your energy or creativity).\n\nSean's strict rules about what constitutes a good day job runs counter to the ideas of Carol Lloyd in *Creating a Life Worth Living*. Lloyd agrees that one of the dangers of a day job is that it could take the time and energy that an artist needs for his art. Depending on its nature, a day job does this in two ways:\n\n- If the day job is lucrative, its illusion of security and comfort could eventually make the artist forget his original creative intention.\n- If the day job is intolerable and low-paying, the artist lives in poverty and discomfort, making him give up his art and blaming it for his misfortune.\n\nThat said, some of the qualities of a day job that Sean preaches against were actually found attractive by artists that Lloyd interviewed in her book depending on where they were in their careers. Lloyd presents the following four categories of day jobs that artists choose for themselves.\n\n1. Big tent - These jobs don't necessarily require you to use your main craft, but it puts you in contact with individuals and groups that engage in it because they deal with the business side of your craft. The downside of big tent jobs is that they could cause \"midwife syndrome\" or the feeling that you are helping others succeed in their art while neglecting yourself. Big tent jobs are for the most ambitious artists who are just starting out because they allow for a lot of networking that could lead to a big break.\n2. No contest - These jobs are chosen by artists who want a clear reminder of what their priorities are. No contest jobs do not tempt the artist away from his dreams as they require very little qualifications and almost no career growth. Because of this, no contest jobs help artists be focused in their goals. Among their benefits is that they could be a source of research or inspiration for the aspiring artist. They could also provide opportunities for physical exertion that balance an artist's intellectual activities. However, they are notoriously low-paying and repetitive that they can eventually feel like drudgery. Artists could reframe this though and turn it into a motivation to strive to change their situation. Younger artists like them more than older ones. A strategy is to find a no contest job in a big tent context.\n3. Counter balance - These are jobs in an entirely different industry from an artist's main craft. Like no contest jobs, they can be sources of inspiration or they can also take your mind off your projects completely, which eventually works wonders for them. However, unlike no contest jobs, they require more commitment as one needs to achieve a higher level of skill to do them. Because of this, they could tempt an artist away from his original creative vision if he is not careful.\n4. Wellspring - These are jobs that are closer to your passion or craft because they use it. They can be more lucrative than other day jobs but they present more temptation on the artist and could rob him of the time and energy he should be giving to his art because his day job and his art use the same creative energy.\n\nThese four categories organize the different day jobs Lloyd noticed from her interviewees. However, she presents only two main criteria for a good day job:\n\n1. It should pay the bills.\n2. It should not be at odds with your creative ambitions.\n\nThe second criteria implies that it is very important to really articulate what your creative ambition is. If you start there, you can design a day job that matches your ambition more.\n\nThinking about all of these ideas about what constitutes a good day job, helped me articulate [[My ideal day job]].\n\n# References\n\nLobenstine, M.

    "content": "\nWhile it is always difficult to come up with conclusive answers to these kinds of questions (because of the dearth of resources as pointed out by W.H. Scott) I think one's answers to these kinds of questions will be more accurate if one always begins his_her analysis on individual family (usually extended) units_networks which were really what existed at the earliest times in these islands. At the earliest times, a person only identifies with his_her family, because settlements are almost always made up of blood relatives. Even large settlements that we would now call an entire barangay or an entire \"bayan\"_town, are still made up of blood relatives. One's identification and allegiance was not on a municipality, a province, a region, or a \"nation.\" One was only identified to what one directly sees: the family. If I'll be philosophical, it is still an \"imagined community,\" a concept rather than a Platonian object. But at least, compared to that larger \"imagined community\" we modern people call the Philippines, I would say that it is easier to \"imagine\" and therefore connect myself to that smaller group of people I call my family.\n\nNow to illustrate how this way of thinking might help us be more critical about the categories we are using to explain our past, here's a situation. If we go back to that time when everything that existed were families, what if one family (say made up of about 500 households) raids another family's settlement (say made up of a similar size)? Completely raided it, displaced the origignal inhabitants of the settlement or perhaps assimilated them within their own kind as subordinates. Shouldn't we be using the same concepts/terms just because the group that invaded is not an impirial power by our definition? Because what invaded was just made up of a small group? A family?\n\nAt that specific place, where the raid happened, shouldn't we be also using the word \"colonial\" to refer to whatever transpired after the raid? And pre-colonial to whatever happened before it?\n\nOn another note. Where is this need to classify things as colonial and precolonial come from? Is this categorization, by itself colonial? Is it possible or useful in some situations to let go of the categorization? When we are using such terms to categorize things in these group of islands, are we doing so as modern Filipinos? Or are we be able to see things in the eyes of the earliest settlers in this group of islands?\n\n## References",

    "content": "\n## To dos\n\n1. Identify your big vision: break the vision into smaller goals.\n2. Check if creative systems, routines, and habits align with your goals.\n3. Iterate.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe notes here shall be added into my forest garden. They are the most relevant to my thoughts and work. Whatever I didn't include here are less relevant.\n\n**Iterate to improve your writing habits.**\n\nDIY MFA teaches to identify your personal best practices in your writing life. This can be done by iteration, a concept borrowed from lean entrepreneurship.\n\nThe process for iteration is as follows:\n1. Choose one variable (don't test multiple variables) to introduce into your current writing routine.\n2. Choose a concrete, specific, and measurable output (usu. time when revising and outlining and word count when writing the first draft).\n3. Perform a writing session introducing the variable.\n4. Track the output + how you felt during session.\n5. Perform 12 writing sessions testing 12 data points within three weeks.\n6. Evaluate and analyze by asking the following: What’s working? What’s not working? What has been effective for my writing? What can I improve? Look for overall trends and general patterns.\n7. Use the results of the evaluation to improve your current writing routine.\n\n**You can become a great writer even without an MFA**\n\nThe target market of MFA programs are people:\n- who write literary fiction, creative fiction, or poetry;\n- thrive in a formal academic environment;\n- rich enough to afford the tuition;\n- and who has a lot of time to make the most of it.\n\nNot everyone fits the criteria above, therefore, not everyone needs an MFA. Fortunately, those who don't fit the MFA criteria can still be great writers by perfecting their craft and producing great books.\n\nIn addition, pursuing a writing life outside an MFA allows a writer to enjoy two benefits that are so difficult to achieve in an MFA:\n- You are able to fit your writing into your real life.\n- You take things at your own pace, which builds internal motivation.\n\n**Three elements of a writing life**\n\nTo get better as a writer, you only need to focus on three things:\n\n1. Write with focus. Explore at first but get clarity on your goals and pursue concrete projects to finish.\n2. Read with purpose. Maintain a reading list, which you read to understand the author's craft and find something in it that you can use in your own writing.\n3. Build your community.\n\nIdeally, maintain a time allocation of 50% writing, 25% reading, and 25% community-building. But keep this allocation flexible depending on your projects.\n\nTwo rules to follow:\n\n1.  No single element can ever disappear altogether.\n2.  Evaluate your time allocation every 1-2 weeks to maintain its relevance.\n\n---\n## Foreword\n\nAcademic training could help a writer publish, but it cannot replace determination.\n\n\"The surest way to grow as a writer is to grow as a human being.\" - Jacquelyn Mitchard\n\n## Chapter 1: Discover the DIY MFA Mindset (Processed)\n\nThe DIY MFA Mindfulness Manifesto\n\n-   Writer's block does not exist.\n-   Resistance is your compass.\n-   Do not compound failure with guilt.\n-   There is no such thing as a \"best practice.\"\n-   Iterate, iterate, iterate.\n\nPrioritize writing projects that are both high-stakes and exciting over throwaway projects.\n\nWhen a writing project is meaningful, resistance usually happens.\n\nIn writing, test different approaches and only adopt the ones that give you the results you want.\n\nVITAL steps to iteration in writing\n\n- V = Choose your input and output variables. Determine an input (independent variable) that you superimpose on a writing session (e.g., environment, background sound, ritual, props, etc.). Then determine a concrete, specific, and measurable output (dependent variable) that you will measure after the experiment. Output is usually time and word count or both. It is good to measure word count when writing the first draft, while time is best measured during revising or outlining.\n- I = Collect information. Track time and words written, but also how you felt during your writing session. You need to establish a writing process that feels good. Track at least 12 data points in 12 writing sessions to give you enough information to see patterns. Use a sheet that tracks the following: date, variable, words, time, how it felt.\n- T = Set a trip wire. Set a deadline for the data collection stage. Do not collect data for more than three weeks.\n- A = Evaluate and analyze. Ask: What’s working? What’s not working? What has been effective for my writing? What can I improve? Look for overall trends and general patterns.\n- L = Learn from the results and decide what's next. Keep doing what works and let go of what doesn’t.\n\nUse pivoting in your writing life. Instead of overhauling it, make a small tweak to your process and apply the VITAL steps.\n\nDon’t test multiple input variables at the same time.\n\n## Chapter 2: Customize Your Learning (Processed)\n\nBeautiful writing not credentials will get your book published.\n\nMany writers perfect their craft and produce great books without ever getting a degree.\n\nTo make a writing life sustainable, you need to fit your writing into your real life. You need to pace yourself and build internal motivation. These goals are challenging when getting credentialed.\n\nWho MFA is for:\n- Writers of literary fiction, creative nonfiction, or poetry.\n- Writers who thrive in a formal academic environment.\n- Those who can afford the tuition.\n- Those with time to make the most of the experience.\n\n### The DIY MFA Formula\n\n1.  Write with focus. Play and explore at first, but eventually, you need to choose a project and finish it.\n2.  Read with purpose. Read with the intention of understanding an author’s craft and finding something in it that you can use to improve your writing.\n3.  Build your community.\n\nNote: These are also what [[thoughts/craig mod]] said are the main areas of a writing life.\n\nIdeally, maintain a time allocation of 50% writing, 25% reading, and 25% community-building. But keep this allocation flexible depending on your projects.\n\n### Two rules of the pie\n\n1.  No slice can ever disappear altogether. Dropping one piece kills you momentum in that area.\n2.  Evaluate your pie every 1-2 weeks to maintain its relevance.\n\n## Chapter 3: Set Goals and Start Strong (Processed)\n\nYour writing career is a road trip and your goals are the destinations in your map.\n\nEstablish where you are right now in your writing career before setting goals. Use the writing inventory for this. See [[My writing life inventory]].\n\nBuy the following necessary supplies:\n\n-   Strunk and White’s The Elements of Style\n-   At least one book of writing techniques.\n-   At least one anthology of short-form literature for inspiration.\n\nEstablish a vision for where you want to be. Use it to maintain focus.\n\nYour big goals could change year to year. Set at most three goals a year.\n\nTranslate your vision into a concrete outcome.\n\nBreak your vision into smaller increments to make it more manageable.\n\nCelebrate each milestone.\n\nSmaller goals make it easier to track your progress, which is necessary to encourage you.\n\nAnswer the following questions to set your vision:\n\n- What’s your destination, the big vision or long-term goal you have for your writing?\n- What’s the concrete outcome that will tell you that you’ve reached your goal?\n- Reverse engineer the milestones leading up to that concrete event. Work backwards from the goal and try to make each milestone as small as possible.\n- What first small step can you take toward your goal right this moment? Do it today.\n\nTrack your progress by tracking your goals. This will show you how far you’ve come and give insight into your writing process.\n\nKeep your big vision front and center so you can set milestones and action steps with integrity.\n\n# WRITE WITH FOCUS\n\n## Chapter 4: Motivate Yourself (Processed)\n\nManage your choices to control your productivity.\n\nThe most important part of writing is filling up the blank page.\n\nWriting is too much work to be considered a hobby.\n\nTalent is often irrelevant; what matters is how serious you are about your writing.\n\nWriters make writing their priority.\n\nH = Honor your reality\nA = Add constraints\nB = Block time and batch tasks\nI = Iterate\nT = Ten percent rule\nS = Set the mood\n\nHonor your reality\n- Your writing life and real life can coexist. Fit writing into your busy life.\n\nAdd constraints\n- Use two constraints: word count and time.\n- Use word count for a first draft.\n- Use time limit for planning or revising.\n- When you hit your word count or time goal, stop; don't work past the point of fatigue.\n- Keep your momentum by writing something every day.\n- Use the ten percent rule to increase your goal slowly.\n\t- Choose a comfortable goal then add ten percent (e.g., 33 minutes instead of 30 or 550 words instead of 500)\n\t- Add ten percent whenver you start feeling comfortable with your goal.\n- Create a writing process that will help you to write many beautiful books.\n- Your process should be flexible enough that you could write anywhere even when the situation is less perfect.\n\n## Chapter 5: Fail Better (Processed)\n\nFailure and rejection are part of a writer's life and are essential ingredients to your success.\n\nUse a system to cope with failure and bounce back from rejection.\n\nF = Face your fears\nA = Assemble your allies\nI = Initiate and iterate\nL = Let it go\n\nFail fast and fail often to eliminate a bad option and establish a creative process that moves closer to success.\n\nFace your fears\n- Fear indicates where you should concentrate.\n- Fear is an essential component of courage.\n- Courage is taking a leap of faith despite fear.\n\nIterate and iterate\n- You don't need to get it all right on the first try; start a project even if you don't feel ready.\n- Don't take setbacks personally: say \"This failed\" not \"I failed.\"\n- There is no such thing as failed writing. All writing is part of the journey to getting better.\n- Think of failure as progress.\n\nLet it go\n- Acknowledge your mistakes and learn from them but do not waste energy obsessing over them.\n\n## Chapter 6: Generate Ideas on Demand\n\n1. Myth: Creativity is an exclusive club, and you can't be a part of it. Truth: Anyone can be creative, but they have to work for it.\n2. Myth: Creativity is innate—you either have it or you don't. Truth: No one is born creative. You become creative through small, simple steps.\n3. Myth: Creativity is driven by chaos, so there's no way to control it. Truth: Creativity is a process with logical, repeatable steps. To recreate your successes, you need to be methodical even when you allow playfulness into your processs.\n4. Myth: Creativity is all about getting that one \"big idea.\" Truth: Although it has some luck into it, a writing career is fostered from years of hard work and taking action.\n5. Myth: Creativity means polishing an idea until it's perfect. Truth: Learn from small failures until it finally works.\n\nCreativity is logical and straightforward. You can turn it on or off.\n\nFour stages of creativity (IDEA)\n1. I = Inspiration\n2. D = Development\n3. E = Evaluation\n4. A = Action\n\nThe more often you go through this cycle, the more skilled you are in generating new ideas.\n\nInspiration\n- You can sidestep inspiration by using brainstorming techniques and writing prompts.\n- Leave some things to chance (e.g., choose a random exercise or prompt, flip a coin or roll a dice to make decisions).\n- Engage the five senses. You will find thousands of stories around you if you only pay attention.\n- Silence your inner critic. Laugh at it by keeping a mascot of it.\n- Break out of your comfort zone. Notice when a habit has become too comfortable and is no longer useful. Practice the ten percent rule.\n- Create an idea bank: a safe space where you store project ideas until they are activated. Schedule a regular time to review your idea bank.\n- Create an oracle: a place to go for inspiration:\n\t- Collect writing prompts or book of prompts.\n\t- Collect images, mementos, and anything else that will spark a story.\n\t- Use a word box filled with slips of paper with random words.\n\nDevelopment\n- Imitation\n\t- You can even copy yourself!\n\t- Choose an author whose voice or style you admire, and then copy a paragraph of one of her stories longhand. Get a sense of how the words feel as you write them on the page. Try to get into the author's mind-set. What was it like to be this author? What was it like to write these words?\n\t- You can also try to imitate the voice or style of a writer you admire by applying that style to your own words or stories.\n\t- When you have learned the rules of an author's style and have recreated his voice, you can break those rules and craft your own voice.\n- Improvisation\n\t- \"Whatever you think can't be done, somebody will come along and do it. A genius is the one most like himself.\"\n\t- Start making the process all your own.\n- Incubation\n\t- Take a break from a project to give you the necessary perspective and distance to gain new insights and eventually make a breakthrough.\n\t- Practice productive procrastination.\n\t- Unplug from media for a period of time.\n\t- Do something completely different: active, repetitive, and restorative.\n- Evaluation\n\t- Ooch your way into a book-length project.\n\t- Make smaller sampler projects to test if you like the idea behind the book.\n\t- Start by writing a short story. Do not summarize your entire book. Take a deep dive into one particular aspect of the larger story. Focus on creating a standalone piece with a beginning, middle, and end.\n\t- Use the short story to build your platform, boost your writer's resume, and connect with readers.\n\t- Give your story to a few readers and ask for feedback.\n\t- Use the feedback to improve your overall project.\n\t- Decide whether you want to stick with the book project.\n\t- Make sure your story is marketable. Know what is new in your genre. Read comps to determine whether your book has legs.\n\t- View your book as one incremental step in your career as a writer.\n\t- Extract an outline from your draft to show you what you've written and what still remains. See redundancies and gaps. Use the outline to plan, test an idea, take inventory, and revise.\n- Action\n\t- Occassionally step back and look at your project as a whole.\n\t- The IDEA cycle only becomes complete when a reader is finally reading your book.\n\n## Chapter 7: Outline your book like a boss\n\nMost writers fall somewhere between plotter and plantser.\n\nYou can flip-flop between the two depending on your project and where you are in your process.\n\nUse an outline but adjust it as your story develops.\n- Do not use a long-list outline.\n- Instead, use modular outline techniques.\n\n### Scene cards\n- Create scene cards.\n- 1 card = 1 scene\n- A scene card contains the following:\n\t- Title for the scene - short and catchy; helps remember the scene\n\t- Major players - treat crowds as a unit\n\t- The action - 2-3 sentences\n\t- The purpose - scenes should either contribute to the plot or help develop a character, or both.\n- Write scene cards for scenes you have already written and those you have yet to write.\n- How to use them\n\t- Play with the order of your book.\n\t- Jump between different scenes.\n\t- Change directions.\n\t- Eliminate irrelevant scenes.\n\nMind maps\n- Write the title or topic at the center of the page.\n- Draw branches to subtopics.\n- Draw branches from subtopics.\n- Use thought bubbles for ideas and speech bubbles for quotes.\n- Doodle or sketch the ideas you are mapping.\n- Caveat: Mind maps do not lend themselves to narratives. Best for prescriptive nonfiction.\n- Novelists and memoirists can use it for world-building or keeping track of different groups of characters.\n\nStory sketch\n- Captures the overall essence of your study.\n- Include a story sketch at the beginning of your submission to help critique partners.\n- How to write one:\n\t- Write the flap copy (elevator pitch) for your story. Provide just enough information to entice readers.\n\t- List your five most important characters and provide a brief description for each one.\n\t- Give a short description of the story's world and narration.\n\t- Choose a theme song or soundtrack for your story.\n\t- Sum up your story in a fortune cookie saying.\n\nStory map\n- Imagine the story map as a subway system:\n\t- Subway line = subplot or story thread\n\t- Dots (subway stops) = individual scenes\n\t- Black dots (local stops) = scenes for only one storyline\n\t- White dots (express stops) = scenes where two or more plot threads intersect\n- Benefits:\n\t- You could tease apart the different threads and test each one for pacing, buildup, and tension\n\t- Can isolate the main plot or a subplot and examine it separately.\n\t- Ensures that conflict, which drives your story, is at the center of your outline.\n- How to write one:\n\t- Write out your scenes. Use your scene cards.\n\t- Figure out the plot threads, thematic elements, or images you want to track in your story map.\n\t- For each plot thread, determine the dramatic question: the question or conflict that drives the story.\n\t\t- Main plot thread = Major Dramatic Question (MDQ)\n\t\t- Subplots = Lesser Dramatic Questions (LDQs)\n\t\t- These questions boil down each plotline to one central conflict\n\nMood boards\n- Use this to convey the mood of your story.\n\nHow to use outlines\n1. Use it as a diagnostic tool while you write your first draft.\n2. Extract an outline from a finished draft.\n3. Extract outlines from books you read and get an in-depth look at their story and structure\n\n***\n\n### Reading\n\nRead classics to put your writing into context.\n\nRead broadly across different genres and topics.\n\nThree objectives when reading:\n1. Read books that teach you the craft and help improve your writing.\n2. Read to deduce strategies you can use in your own writing projects.\n3. Respond to books by taking notes and analyzing them.\n\nChoose books that are both fun to read and improve your mind.\n\nRead the first 10 pages of a book. If you want to give it the benefit of the doubt, read the first 10 percent. But if a book doesn't work for you after that, do not hesitate to drop it down even if it is a classic. Life is so short.\n\nInvest your money and shelf space to just a few necessary books:\n- A = Anthology of short-form literature\n- B = Book of prompts\n- C = Craft reference\n\nShort-form literature is a piece you can consume in about an hour.\n\nHere are the benefits of short-form literature:\n- It is easy to see the story arc and how the different elements fit together.\n- You can study the small craft (grammar, syntax, word choice, and punctuation) and big craft (character development and story structure) and see how micro level elements affect the macro level.\n- It is easy to spot character transformation.\n- Stories are focused and to the point.\n- You can learn economy of words.\n\nUse book of prompts that arrange exercises according to technique and target particular aspects of the writing craft. This kind of book will help you work on a specific technique or element of writing separately before applying it to your project.\n\nPractice outside the context of your project. Master the skill then apply it to your work.\n\nHow to do the petri dish technique:\n1. Find the specific problem.\n2. Look for an exercise that focuses on the technique that solves your problem.\n3. Practice for one solid week for 15 to 20 minutes a day.\n\t1. Do not change variables.\n\t2. Only change the context of the prompt (apply it to different characters or circumstances).\n\t3. Once you complete a prompt, date it then file it. Do not reread it.\n\t4. Take a week off.\n\t5. Review your prompts. Look at the progress from the first to the last exercise. Have you improved?\n\t6. If you are confident, apply the practice to your existing work.\n\nCreate a reading list that is unique to your interests and writing projects.\n\nYour two main objectives when reading are:\n1. Improve your current writing project.\n2. Challenge you to read broadly and understand literature as a whole.\n\nFour Cs of a reading list\n1. Competitive titles\n2. Contextual titles\n3. Contemporary books\n4. Classics\n\nCompetitive titles\n- Directly competes with your book\n- Same genre and category as your work\n- Covers similar themes and subject matter\n- Use comp titles to find authors with readers who will also be your readers.\n\nContextual Books\n- Puts your project into context.\n- Not same genre or readers but same theme or subject matter\n- Books that use a particular storytelling technique, even if it delves on a different subject matter.\n- Track the earliest book that used the technique.\n\nContemporary Books\n- Read a few books in your genre published in the past three years.\n- Aspire to be aware of new trends to know where your genre or niche is going.\n- Study how they are launched or marketed.\n- Find at least one book written by an author considered a founder of your genre.\n\nClassics\n- Read classical short-form literature.\n\nMake a list of 12 books with at least 2 books in each category.\n\nHere is [[My ABC books]]\n\nHere is [[My reading list]]\n\nRead through your list within one year, which means read one book per month.\n\nEvaluate your list every month\n\n## Related\n\n- [[Writing variables to test]]\n\n# References\n\nPereira, G.

    "content": "\n# [[2023-08-02]]\n\nWhile walking up forestry, I came across two dogs walking down. I remember seeing a lump of meat one time when I was going up forestry. From afar it looked like a log albeit a weird looking one. Upon closer inspection, I saw that it was a body of a dead dog hardened by the cold. Its stomach bulged and its hind legs were apart like branches of a dead log. As I remember this, I waited for a lone car going down Lantican to pass the first dog I saw. Made sure it was ok. A few months ago, two cats of UPLB died from separate car crashes. These happened about an hour apart. I notice that drivers here drive faster when there are more people or animals on the road or when the roads are narrower. They go against nature. Perhaps this is why I can't make myself buy a car no matter what I do. I prefer walking.\n\n## Walking to Forestry on a Caffeinated Mind\n\nI took a tablespoon filled with coffee and mixed it on hot water an hour before I walked. And now that I am walking to forestry I could hear everything, see everything, feel everything. I raise my head up at the sky and see the clouds dissolving into the night like coffee granules on hot water.",

    "title": "Friedrich Nietzsche",
    "content": "\nWe can divide Nietzsche’s life into four phases:\n\n# Phase 1: 1844 (birth) to 1869 (became a professor of classical philology at the University of Basle)\n\n- Nietzsche received a tough classical education in Pforta secondary school.\n- He then had an excellent academic career at the Universit of Bonn then Leipzig\n- He became a professor at the age of 24.\n- He taught Greek philology for ten years. He struggled because of workload and lectures.\n- He knew that philology was not his calling, but he embraced it because it welcomed him. Through philology, he read Greek authors:\n   - tragedians (Aeschylus, Sophocles)\n   - poets (Homer, Hesiod)\n   - philosophers (Heraclitus, Anaximander)\n   - historians (especially Diogenes Laertius)\n- He was attracted to music at an early age but later fascinated by philosophy.\n\n# Phase 2: 1869 to 1979\n\n- This was a time when Nietzsche experienced numerous troubles in different areas of his life:\n   - Health problems: fainting, seizures, headache, eye problems, migraine\n   - Professional: critical response to *The Birth of Tragedy* (1871)\n   - Relationships: problems with friends, rejections in marriage proposals\n   - Social: He was unable to establish a name in academic and intellectual circles\n- Nietzsche slowly reduced his responsibilities: discharged from one course then gave up lectures at the secondary school. This culminated to a one-year leave. None of these truly worked, but here he discovered long walks and great solitude, which diverted his attention from his health problems. At first he took long six-hour walks in comfortable terrain like lakesides or forests.\n   - ‘If only I could have a little house somewhere like this; I would walk for six or eight hours a day, composing thoughts that I would later jot down on paper.’\n\n# Phase 3: 1879 to 1888\n\n- After resigning, he was able to live on the combination of three small grants. He lived modestly, living in small inns and traveling between mountains, the sea, cities, and towns.\n- He became a walker. It was where he did his work.\n   - In the summer of 1879, he walked for eight hours a day and wrote texts for the book *The Wanderer and His Shadow*. Except for a few lines, he scribbled the entire book in six small notebooks.\n   - ‘I walk on average an hour in the morning, three hours in the afternoon, at a good pace – always the same route: it is beautiful enough to bear repetition’, March 1888\n- Within this period, Nietzsche wrote his greatest books:\n   - *The Dawn* to *On the Genealogy of Morality*\n   - *The Gay Science*\n   - *Beyond Good and Evil*\n   - *Zarathustra*\n- For Nietzsche, walking was a precondition to his work. It was not a distraction from work.\n   - “We do not belong to those who have ideas only among books, when stimulated by books. It is our habit to think outdoors – walking, leaping, climbing, dancing, preferably on lonely mountains or near the sea where even the trails become thoughtful. Our first questions about the value of a book, of a human being, or a musical composition are: Can they walk? Even more, can they dance?”\n- His work distinguishes [[Words written outdoors vs indoors]]\n- By mid-1880s, Nietzsche was no longer walking as well as before due to back pain. His walks started to be shorter and with friends, which decreased his solitude. These walks made him tired. He needed days to recuperate.\n\n# Phase 4: 1888 to 1900\n\nHe discovered Turin in April 1888. Long walks there enchanted him. He became well and started working again. He walked in the morning then accumulated notes in the evening.\n\nHowever, in January 1889, Nietzsche exhibited signs of madness and dementia. He was sent to the clinic in Basle then to Jena but did not improved. His mom took him in at Naumburg and cared for him for seven years until his death in August 25, 1900.\n\nTags: [[Fruitful]]\n\n# References\n\nGros, F. (2014). *A Philosophy of Walking*. Verso.\n\n",

I see and feel Thoreau in him without him even trying to copy Thoreau's writing (unlike what [[Annie Dillard]] did). His life is what is most Thoreauvian.\n\nHe was committed to a philosophical-spiritual life. [[thoughts/philosophy]] for him was an exploration of his life in the context of other lives in nature. Living philosophically was more important to him than professional prominence. While he didn't write exactly like Thoreau, his writings were lyrical. He was an active participant in his writings ([[thoughts/lyrical philosophy]]). In some ways, he even overtaked Thoreau, particularly in the contest of who wrote lesser.\n\n## Bugbee wrote little because his life was his masterpiece\n\nWhile Thoreau only published two books, he wrote prolific journal entries in private. Bugbee wrote very little both in public and in private.\n\nBugbee's daily writing, as exemplified in [[thoughts/the inward morning by bugbee]], is succinct. If I understood [[The philosophical method of Henry Bugbee]], what he wrote in his journal each day was all the writing he did that day. It looks lazy. But it does mirrors a poet's life. A poet doesn't have to force word counts. Bugbee, it seems, spent more time outdoors than indoors, writing. He did read a lot but he was outdoors, making himself useful while opening himself up for revelation.\n\nThis reflects the fact that his life was truly his masterpiece. It was his experiences in private that he cherished and he was the only witness.\n\nThis point is interesting to me. Is living a wonderful life not enough? Do we still need to write about it? Why does he world need to know?\n\nWhile he wrote a little, Bugbee still wrote, which meant he found something worthwhile in sharing his thoughts.\n\n## Related\n\n- [[The philosophical method of Henry Bugbee]]\n\n# References\n",

Lewis\n- Albert Borgmann\n- Stanley Cavell\n\n# The Inward Morning\n\n_The Inward Morning_—written not as a monograph, but a philosophical exercise conducted through 15 months of journal entries.\n\n_The Inward Morning_ wanders through styles and subjects like a mountain hiker through altitudinal biomes. Conceptual analysis gives way to meditations on the writings of Gabriel Marcel and Meister Eckhart, which then flow into impressionistic depictions of memories drawn from early childhood, his years as a champion rower, and his time at sea. All the while, however, Bugbee refuses the declarative register of professional academic philosophy in favor of a ruminative, questioning, almost confessional tone.\n\n“I have yet to discover how to say what moves me to the endless search and research, the reflective turning over in my mind of experience. The turning over is all so much tilling.” (Inward Morning, 33)\n\n==The work that follows is Bugbee’s record of the tilling and cultivation of his mental garden, and the results—like beans dried on the vine, pumpkins forgotten in the field—constantly supply him with seeds for new questions and investigations. -\u003e (A description mimicking [[thoughts/forest garden of the mind]]).\n\nThe thinker revealed in the course of the book is a perpetual wonderer caught in perplexity, for whom reality arrives as an inexhaustible mystery—one that is deciphered not by weaving elaborate tapestries of philosophical language, but through the action of daily living.\n\n# Fly-fishing and mountain-climbing\n\nBugbee devoted as much time to fly-fishing and mountain-climbing as he did to philosophy. Indeed, he lived by the principle that no division exists between philosophical meditation and meditative activity.\n\nFishing, like walking and writing, became an occasion for contemplation.\n\n# Bugbee and walking\n\n“My philosophy took shape mainly on foot. It was truly peripatetic, engendered not merely while walking, but through walking that was essentially a _meditation of the place_.” (Inward Morning, 139)\n\n# Doing and writing philosophy\n\nPhilosophy, for Bugbee, was first and foremost rooted in the concrete, granular details of life as it is lived, and in the process of decision-making that shapes it.\n\n“For meditation is the thoughtful reckoning of the will with its own life: Its concern is that of truth underlying human decision. . . My task has been that of overcoming such abstraction, to accommodate the life of spirit with all the mind.” (Inward Morning, 10)\n\n“If philosophy is a personal search for the quick, the soul of personal life and the unknown wilderness in which we trek, then Bugbee’s is one of the few philosophers you can read as exemplifying this search. Where most philosophers focus in a detached way on abstract arguments for this or that, Bugbee dares you to immerse your soul in the wonders of nature.” (Mooney)\n\nIndeed, at the heart of Bugbee’s philosophy stands the primacy of the question.\n\n“Creation is inexpungably mysterious and can only be understood through participation in it.” (Inward Morning, 233)\n\n==Philosophical writing, for Bugbee, becomes a kind of cartography: the drawing of a map while finding a way through the wilderness of reflection.\n\n\"My task has been to learn to write in a vein compatible with what I can honestly say in the act of trying to discover what I must say. It has been a precarious business. I have found myself thinking quite differently from the majority of men who are setting the style and the standard of philosophy worth doing. . . Often I do not know what I am trying to say.\" (Inward Morning, 79)\n\nperplexity itself is not the goal\n\nBugbee’s confusion quickly resolves into a reverence for the overabundant, miraculous nature of our experience of things. Wonder stirs us to openness—to a receptive, inquisitive comportment toward the world—which then proves to be the true source of the certainty so desired by philosophers.\n\nBugbee shows us that the possibility of philosophizing never ends, that there is always truth to be found in quiet and calm—and that it’s available not just to aristocrats or the quick-witted, but to anyone with eyes to see, a few memories, and an honest heart.\n\n# Using literature in philosophy\n\nBugbee didn't limit himself from a philosophical canon. He read and used in his writing: Herman Melville, Charles M. Doughty, Franz Kafka, Sophocles, Faulkner\n\nLiterature, it seems, can have just as much a philosophical character as canonical, written philosophy. And in his engagement with Buddhist thought in his friendship with D. T. Suzuki, Bugbee demonstrated the universality of his approach, drawing eagerly from a source deemed alien to the Western tradition of philosophy beginning with Plato and Aristotle.\n\n# Certainty\n\nCertainty, in Bugbee’s reading, comes not from developing a logically watertight, systematic doctrine that answers the fundamental questions that nag us—the meaning of life, the existence of God, and so forth—but rather from reflection upon experience.\n\n# Wonder\n\nBut for Bugbee, experience is always shot through with wonder,\n\n“a tissue of meaning…permeated with meaning by invasion,” contrary to the empiricist belief in experience as sensory data “from which we are removed to the capacity of observers” and “from which we are in a position to make assured reports.”\n\n# Experience\n\nAgainst the dogma of empiricism, Bugbee insists upon a richer, deeper, and altogether more basic understanding of experience—one that recognizes the genuine philosophical potential of our otherwise mundane daily comings and goings. “The mystery of each thing,” no matter how commonplace, “is the mystery of all things; and this—not generalization or the broadening of our scope of attention to wider and wider complexes of things, is the foundation of the idea of universe: the omnirelevance of the experience of something as sacred.”\n\n# Ethics\n\nthis reconceptualization of certainty and experience proves to be preparatory work for finding a new foundation for ethics.\n\nBugbee’s existentialism directly confronts the question of how to act well.\n\nAgainst modern moral philosophy’s emphasis on choice—that ethics has to do with devising a rational system that dictates how an individual should choose one action over another—\n\n==Bugbee is interested in how the conditions we find ourselves in on a day-to-day level are already a source of “pre-ethical” phenomena that, if properly understood, guide our activity toward the good: before conducting any abstract rational speculation about actions we should or should not take, we already find our lives marked by obligation, commitment, hope, and faith. Proper reflection upon our situation will reveal that our decisions are never conducted as abstract choices between one rationally correct thing or another, but are themselves part of the “tissue of meaning” in which we are always entangled.\n\n“The practical importance of ethical thought lies not in its yielding a blueprint on which we might construct our lives and model our actions, but in the possibility it may afford of immediate clarification with regard to a foundation of life that is absolutely genuine (as opposed to optional, arbitrary, or conditional), and utterly beyond artifice or manipulation.” (Inward Morning, 70)\n\nAction is genuine or it is nothing. It is concrete or it is nothing. An act emerges only from the texture of day-to-day life, from a place; to consider an act abstractly is interesting only inasmuch as it actually happens. But its ultimate source is life, not thought—and any investigation into how good action is possible will have to begin from within the texture of a life.\n\n# Religious nature of his work\n\nBugbee’s corpus offers an utterly undogmatic approach to thinking that weaves a fabric between philosophy and religion. Nowhere in his writing does he ever insist upon the truth of a particular religious creed—there’s no evidence he was ever a religious practitioner—but his work is written in an unmistakably theological register.\n\n# Faith\n\nFaith becomes constitutive for understanding, an attitude undergirding every engagement with the world; to live presupposes faith in the grounds of one’s living, a ground that is never fully comprehensible and that which we can never master.\n\n# Place\n\nBut perhaps the most significant and lasting characteristic of Bugbee’s reflective philosophy is the importance of _place_. Philosophy, for Bugbee, is inextricable from life, and life is always lived _somewhere_: among specific people in a specific landscape, in which one walks and performs specific activities.\n\n“This day is the place of meeting with the lives of persons, yes, even with one’s own life.” (Inward Morning, 40)\n\nWe cannot ever achieve complete control over the place we inhabit in the world of things: rather we are _placed_, we already inhabit an environment, and our philosophizing must begin here. Philosophy is reflection on place, and upon ourselves in place: we think where we are, about where we are, and about what surrounds us—and as place informs our thinking, so too does our thinking reciprocally inform the world in which we move.\n\n# References\n\nJoseph Keegin.

Verso.\n\n\u003e The life Thoreau led – a life of resistance (Emerson recounts that his first response to any request was to say no, that he always found it easier to refuse than to assent), but also of radical choices: working only for what was necessary, walking daily at length, avoiding entanglement in the social game – was quickly judged by others (the upright, the hardworking, the propertied) to be pretty peculiar. However, it was combined with a quest for truth and authenticity. Seeking truth means going beyond appearances. It means denouncing manners and mores, traditions, the everyday, as so many conventions, hypocrisies and lies.",

This volcano has been in an active state from time immemorial, and many eruptions have taken place with more or less effect. The first one of historical importance appears to have occurred in 1641; again in 1709 the crater vomited fire with a deafening noise; on September 21, 1716, it threw out burning stones and lava over the whole island from which it rises, but so far no harm had befallen the villagers in its vicinity. In 1731 from the waters of the lake three tall columns of earth and sand arose in a few days, eventually subsiding into the form of an island about a mile in circumference. In 1749 there was a famous outburst which dilacerated the coniform peak of the volcano, leaving the crater disclosed as it now is. Being only 850 feet high, it is remarkable as one of the lowest volcanoes in the world.\n\nThe last and most desolating of all the eruptions of importance occurred in the year 1754, when the stones, lava, ashes, and waves of the lake, caused by volcanic action, contributed to the utter destruction of the towns of Taal, Tanaúan, Sala, and Lipa, and seriously damaged property in Balayán, 15 miles away, whilst cinders are said to have reached Manila, 34 miles distant in a straight line. One writer says in his MS., compiled 36 years after the occurrence, that people in Manila dined with lighted candles at midday, and walked about the streets confounded and thunderstruck, clamouring for confession during the eight days that the calamity was visible. The author adds that the smell of the sulphur and fire lasted six months after the event, and was followed by malignant fever, to which half the inhabitants of the province fell victims. Moreover, adds the writer, the lake waters threw up dead alligators and fish, including sharks.\n\n# References\n\nForeman, J.

The following interesting account of the pompous ceremonial attending the reception of the Royal Seal, restoring this Court, is given by Concepcion. He says:—“The Royal Seal of office was received from the ship with the accustomed solemnity. It was contained in a chest covered with purple velvet and trimmings of silver and gold, over which hung a cloth of silver and gold. It was escorted by a majestic accompaniment, marching to the sounds of clarions and cymbals and other musical instruments. The cortége passed through the noble city with rich vestments, with leg trimmings and uncovered heads. Behind these followed a horse, gorgeously caparisoned and girthed, upon whose back the President placed the coffer containing the Royal Seal. The streets were beautifully adorned with exquisite drapery. The High Bailiff, magnificently robed, took the reins in hand to lead the horse under a purple velvet pall, bordered with gold. The magistrates walked on either side; the aldermen of the city, richly clad, carried their staves of office in the august procession, which concluded with a military escort, standard bearers, etc., and proceeded to the Cathedral, where it was met by the Dean, holding a Cross. As the company entered the sacred edifice, the Te Deum was intoned by a band of music.”\n\n# References\n\nJuan de la Concepcion, \"Hist.

So it is more important to uncover the answer through living itself than reading.\n\nAnswering how to live is both experiential and intellectual. You read how others lived and try to infuse that into your life. But since you were already living even before you learned how to read, you have no choice but to learn living by living. And that is in fact what the bulk of this learning process is. We learn through trial and error. We have no choice. It is the nature of the geography of life itself.\n\nThe reading part only supplements the living.\n\nWe can live a life without ever reading a single word as our ancestors did many years ago. Reading is but a technology that at least presumably should make living easier. But if we are not careful, it could by itself hamper living. You have to live to live.\n\nAnd then report to us what you learned if u want. So that we may be helped by ur perspective.\n\nI think the question I want to answer is better answered by:\n\n- History (searching answers from past sources)\n- Philosophy (walking and thinking and waiting for insight)\n\nThis means, I search within me for the answer that I can best use for my own life.

    "content": "\nThere are two areas under lyrical philosophy:\n1. Practice\n2. Writing\n\n# Qualities of written lyrical philosophy\n\n- Presents deep thoughtfulness.\n- Veers towards the religious.\n- Tunes to the moment.\n- Dramatic\n- Episodic\n- Conversational\n- Exposes felt-realities\n- Delivers a tang of life\n- Moments of passionate speech\n- Displays the nature of circus identity\n- Shows startling moments of faith\n\n# How to live lyrical philosophy\n\nThe kind of philosophy that I want to do is first lived. Whatever it is that I believe in, I must live it first.\n\nGiven the qualities of the written philosophy I want to write, it is only through truly living lyrically that I can give birth to lyrical writing.\n\nLove the form of life suited to yourself.\n\nYou must live a life that you can affirm through passionate speech.\n\nTake care of your soul.\n- Open yourself to your deepest passions and values even those that are irrational.\n- Yield and take care of that part of you that is untamed and filled with contradictions.\n\nIntegrate piety with intellectual work.\n\nMooney's method\n\u003eIn teaching, I move naturally from a mountain-trail CAUTION or a poem of Emily Dickinson to contemplative activities, such as reading, writing, thinking quietly, focused on texts tilted toward the religious.\n\nThis is where walking can be integrated into philosophy. Use everything around you as prompt for philosophizing. Remember Martin Bunzl:\n\u003e\"What I found early in my career was that there are two different ways to do philosophy, at least the kind of philosophy I do, which is analytic philosophy. One is to focus very hard on the steps in an argument when you are trying to assess whether or not it is a good argument. But there's another way to do philosophy, which is to try to relax and let your mind wander and be surprised by the associations that you get.\"\n\nSee [[thoughts/my thinking while walking strategy]].\n\nBunzl produced analytical philosophy. I want to produce beautiful words that delve into existence and foundational issues. How do I pull this of? Only [[Annie Dillard]] comes to mind.\n\nRaise the most profound questions but refuse to provide satisfying answers.\n\n## Practicing a living lyrical philosophy is all about sharpening your attention\n\nAspire for better seeing, imagining, and feeling. When you have sharpened your attention, you become more open to revelations of ordinary reality and the fine textures of your life and that of others. A sharp attention gives you a poet's unclouded lyrical eye.\n\nWhen practicing presence, resist the desire to represent and analyze. Just strive to be present and eloquent so you can let philosophy, poetry, and religion merge.\n\n# How to read lyrical philosophy\n\nUnderstand what is said, how it is said, and how it affects your own sensibilities.\n\n\u003eI listen to what is said, how it is said, and how it elicits my own sensibilities and soul. What is said could be a simple declaration “Be yourself.” We get the dictionary meaning of each word if not a message. How it is said begins to fill in meaning beyond mere recitation of sounds. It might be rebuking (“Stop playing the clown!” Or, encouraging. “Just relax, you’ll do fine!”). Third, I might register my existential response. As I hear, “Be Yourself!” I might ask if I personally avoid—or embrace or am just baffled by “Be Yourself!”\n\u003e\n\u003eWe wonder if we sense what they sense\n\n# How to write lyrical philosophy\n\n“Philosophy necessarily stands in the radiance of what is beautiful and in the throes of what is holy.” (Heidegger) Strive to make the beautiful and the present be both radiantly present and strangely elusive.\n\nThe philosopher's task is \"to write the drama of life as it is.\" To do this successfully, the philosopher must be able to communicate what actors \"say, think, and feel, but also what they are expressing.\" A successful philosophical account should provide a complete picture of life, different from the \"incompleteness\" of academic philosophy, which avoids discussion of passionate utterances. Reading a full account of the drama of life should make us \"feel the very tang of life itself.\"\n\nA complete philosophical account includes an answer to why, explains so the reader can understand, and the reader would be able to \"feel the very tang of life itself.\"\n\nAspire for presence to leap from the page where you have written the way wonder leaps from the world.\n\n- Convey it as a dramatic living narrative.\n- ==Focus on seeking and conveying episodic felt-realities.\n\nAttitude\n- Value action and \"a yielding soul.\"\n- Focus on imaginative mulling, yielding, and listening\n- Let go of the need for mastery\n\nSubjects\n- Mix philosophy, religion, and literature\n- Self and soul\n- Acting and receiving\n- Thought and passion\n\nForm\n- Use narrative passages.\n\nAspire to write passionate speech by Cavell (See [[thoughts/living philosophy by edward mooney]])\n\n# References\n\nMooney, E.

[[I am a writer with a strong research foundation]].\n\nA tension with this way of writing though is imminent between ideas and the writer’s story.

Listening to Louise (and to authors I've started to meet in the past couple of years) showed me how much biography is in a writer's book be it autobiographical or not.

One sets a purpose before acting ([[Purpose is articulated before an action or a project is performed]]) to avoid the nagging feeling that one is doing something that feels wrong ([[Build a life management system that helps you be at peace with your choices of action]]). When we are acting, we don't want this nagging feeling.

    "content": "\nA life management system is a consolidation of conceptual and physical structures that help an individual embrace [[thoughts/intentional living]]. The structures of a life management system are primarily conceptual (i.e., they exist first in the mind). However, since [[Action occurs in an external objective physical world]], physical structures are needed to extend and realize the conceptual structures.\n\nAlthough these structures can easily become complex, their sole purpose is simply to accomplish [[The core process of intentional living]]. To live intentionally, one needs to set intentions, effectively manage one's actions, and make sure that one’s actions are aligned with one’s intentions. These requirements are fulfilled by a life management system.\n\n[[Every human being has a life management system]] whether they are aware of it or not. But [[thoughts/intentional living]] requires that one's life management system is more consciously maintained and optimized. While optimization is desirable, a life management system shouldn't be too complex that it can no longer do the two most important things it should do:\n\n- [[A life management system should free your mind]]\n- [[Build a life management system that helps you take intentional action]]\n\nOne cannot immediately create [[an optimized life management system]]. A more realistic starting point is a [[Minimum viable life management system]] that can be iterated and optimized through time. Ideally, a life management system should be an accurate system of managing actions grounded on sound philosophy. And because of this, it is more than just a consolidation of life hacks and productivity tips. It should be a reflection of one’s worldview and life philosophy (see [[Theory vs philosophy of living vs life management system]]).\n\nA system has to be put in place whether or not there are inputs so that when inputs do come, one is ready. This principle involves performing regular [[Review]] even if there are only a few things to review.\n\n# My Implementation\n\n- [[My LMS sky level setup]]\n- [[My LMS ground level setup]]\n- [[My LMS reviews setup]]\n\n# Unprocessed\n\nMost Lms are prescriptive and autobiographical.

    "title": "Living Philosophy by Edward F. Mooney",
    "content": "\n# Preface\n\n## Narrative philosophy and religion could clarify and intensify our attitude about ourselves and the world\n\n\u003ePhilosophy and religion can intensify or clarify a stance toward oneself, others, and the world. Narratives are often the vehicle.\n\n## What Ed Mooney is looking for\n\nIn the foreword of his book, *Living Philosophy*, [[thoughts/edward mooney]] shares what kind of writers and writings he made as his life work. He prefers authors that mixed philosophy, religion, and literature. Authors who value action and \"a yielding soul.\" Authors like:\n- [[thoughts/michel de montaigne]]\n- [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]]\n- [[thoughts/søren kierkegaard]]\n- [[thoughts/friedrich nietzsche]]\n- [[thoughts/stanley cavell]]\n- [[thoughts/herman melville]]\n- [[thoughts/henry bugbee]]\n- [[thoughts/ludwig wittgenstein]]\n\nHe then identifies the kinds of writings from these authors that he thinks are interesting. He particularly focuses on narratives. These are the criteria he is looking for:\n- Narratives that present deep thoughtfulness\n- Narratives that veer towards the religious\n- Narratives that are tuned to the moment\n- Dramatic\n- Episodic\n- Conversational\n- Exposes felt-realities\n- Delivers a tang of life\n- Moments of passionate speech\n- Circus identity\n- Self and soul\n- Acting and receiving\n- Thought and passion\n\nMooney contrasts these with assured knowing or structured philosophy.\n\nFor Mooney, these accounts go beyond psychological, sociological and commonsensical ways of understanding. They are received by what he calls the soul. Furthermore, these accounts counter a self that seeks mastery.\n\nThe essays that Mooney wrote in response to these accounts were not a research project. He described them as \"essays along paths that only gradually revealed their interweaving.\"\n\n\u003eNarrative passages from these writers present deep thoughtfulness, veering toward the religious, and tuned to the moment. They are not pronouncements from eternity or timelessly valid demonstrations. They’re dramatic, episodic and conversational, exposing felt-realities.\n\u003e\n\u003eI consider writing that delivers a tang of life and moments of passionate speech, that displays the nature of circus identity. I take up matters of self and soul, acting and receiving, thought and passion.\n\u003e\n\u003eThese accounts of grave and exuberant matters bring us beyond psychological, sociological, or commonsensical ways of understanding. They come to inhabit the soul. A soul is at the receiving end of things, a site of imaginative mulling and yielding, of listening that counters a self that seeks mastery.\n\u003e\n\u003eLiterary philosophers like Montaigne, Thoreau, Nietzsche or Cavell seek episodic felt-realities. What unfolds is not assured knowing or a philosophical system but the exaltation or terror of an open sea.\n\u003e\n\u003eThis is not the outcome of a research project but essays along paths that only gradually revealed their interweaving. For me, this traces a life’s work.\n\n## Living philosophy, after Mooney\n\nI like this word \"living philosophy\" by Mooney. He uses it to refer to philosophy in two ways:\n1. Philosophy as a dramatic living narrative.\n2. Philosophy as something lived by people in various ways.\n\n\u003e“Living Philosophy” in my title has a double sense. We have philosophy that’s conveyed as a dramatic living narrative. And second, we have a spectrum of persons who in various ways are living out their philosophies.\n\n# Passionate speech: Improvisations in the disorders of desire\n\n## Excessive secularization has hindered us from expressing our full selves\n\nExcessive secularization have prevented us from seeing mystery ([[Mysteries I believe in]]). Poetry aims to help us recover that sense of mystery.\n\nJolley, K. D. (2017). _Stony Lonesome_ (1st edition). Summerfield Publishing/New Plains Press.\n\u003eWe have become secular people, partial people; we no longer believe in, much less live in the interpenetration of the natural and the supernatural: we have lost that sense of mystery that creates ceremony, that reveals to us the garden of the world we live in. In our loss of that sense of mystery, we have lost what galvanizes us against sloth, prevents our souls from growing woolly and fungous … Blind to the seasons’ gifts, numb to nature … careless of ourselves and of others, bored alike by damnation and salvation, we become graceless by inaction. It is one (one) aim of poetry to recover that sense of mystery, to beckon us from sloth.\n\n## Soul vs self, after Mooney\n\nEd Mooney differentiates between the self and the soul. He does not provide a clear explanation of the difference. But he just points out that they are different. The self is critical, rational, and controlling. It aspires to overcome obstacles and has a \"just do it\" attitude. To take care of it is to surrender to its control. Taking care of the soul, on the other hand, involves opening oneself to one's deepest passions and values even those that are irrational. Mooney associates the soul to that part of us which is untamed and irresolvable because it is filled with conflicts. Is there available terminology in psychology to capture this difference?\n\nHere's another way to explain the difference. The self desires control. It will create structures, make sense of the world around it, and attempt mastery to protect itself. But nature and the universe is indifferent to the self's well-being. It kills the self. Everyone eventually dies. The self's failure to beat death should lead to awe, astonishment, and later reverence, all other emotions.\n\nPerhaps it is metaphysically incorrect to take these two words and get the two to go against each other. But the contradicting attitudes that the two represent definitely exist and we understand them.\n\n\u003eCare for the soul moves in different terrain than care for the self. The self takes on executive initiatives, has critical and rational drives, and has a will to take charge of life and master its obstructions—“just do it.” Care for the soul is something else again. To value the soul is to be open to one’s deepest passion, its capacity to value.\n\u003e\n\u003eIt is to yield to and care for the untamed, the irresolvable or intractable, the realm of conflicting shadows.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe majestic and sublime can be supremely indifferent to my well-being, despite the self’s will-to-mastery. A sharp reminder of finitude, the failure of mastery in death, calls me to a piety I’ve abandoned. It addresses me in an idiom not solely secular.\n\n## The avoidance of passionate speech in mainstream philosophy deprives us of an essential resource\n\nEd Mooney questions the academe's avoidance of passionate speech, like piety, in favor of critical thinking. For him, excluding piety from the humanities is excluding an important part of being human. Piety counterbalances relentless self-assertive critique. In his teaching, Mooney integrates piety with intellectual work. Not doing so makes an education partial. We are not taught feeling attentively and engaging with our passions responsibly.\n\n\u003eIf I were asked collegially what piety and soul were doing in a secular classroom, I could ask in return why I should stick with a valorization of the secular that excludes evocations of piety.\n\u003e\n\u003eAnd I could ask why in this age of dark woods and horrors, questioning the limits of the executive self violates the aims of the humanities.\n\u003e\n\u003eLiterature, philosophy, art, religion, and music—the humanities—are portals to all things human, and piety is one of those things. There’s truth in piety’s reticence, patience, and listening. It’s relief from relentless self-assertive critique. In teaching, I move naturally from a mountain-trail CAUTION or a poem of Emily Dickinson to contemplative activities, such as reading, writing, thinking quietly, focused on texts tilted toward the religious.\n\u003e\n\u003eMainstream philosophers have by and large disowned passionate speech. We teach critical thinking but not feeling attentively; we teach rational decision theory but not responsible passions.\n\u003e\n\u003eOur blindness to the varied registers of biblical narration, ballet, and biology is both bad logic and stunted passion. Seeing better and feeling with more subtlety can mark metamorphosis of spirit. The worst of passions can be deflated by rational critique, but defeating the worst is not attaining the best.\n\n## Passionate speech, by Cavell\n\nPassionate speech, per Cavell, is not purely descriptive and performative. It is an expression of subjectivity. Passionate speech or utterances live when we receive them; they die when we refuse them, i.e., through applying analysis. That said, there are utterances whose effect are immediate and does not need interpretation (\"there is no space between words and their impacts\"). In these speech and utterances \"presence leaps from the page.\"\n\n\u003ePassionate utterances are “invitations to improvisation in the disorder of desire.”\n\u003e\n\u003eCavell links passionate speech to “redemptive writing” and “redemptive reading.”\n\u003e\n\u003eWe can find witness to “passionate speech,” witness to souls in dark woods, in the epigraph to Cavell’s signal 1962 article, “The Availability of the Philosophy of the Later Wittgenstein.”\n\u003e\n\u003e“passionate utterance” is speech neither purely descriptive nor the ceremonial or quasi-legal domain of performative utterance.\n\u003e\n\u003enot only informative but also a pleading and warning. It’s urgently uttered from the heart, meant to impact my heart, realign my desires.\n\u003e\n\u003eIf I head back rather than continue, it’s due to its elegant improvisation, not to overt threat or coercion or ceremonial effectiveness.\n\u003e\n\u003ePassionate utterance invokes shapes of passion and desire, of imagination and sensibility, prompting the responsiveness Kierkegaard calls our subjectivity. Arcing words can lift us—or leave us indifferent. They live or die as we receive or refuse them.\n\u003e\n\u003eThey are proposals—invitational, intimate universals. They are lifelines—to grasp or not.\n\u003e\n\u003eWe work in the dark reading certain passages from Melville or Kierkegaard. We wonder if we sense what they sense and wonder if it can illuminate our own dark woods. We submit to the madness, the slight mitigation, of art. There are moments in passionate writing when interpretation does not “go all the way down,” where there is no space between words and their impacts. Presence leaps from the page the way wonders leap from the world, leaving enormous room for love of the world, for ongoing revelation, for suspension of doubts. Here is a taste of brie, a wince at sudden light, the flight of an ethereal hawk. At such moments digressive interpretations will miss the grounding tenors of life.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe poet’s unclouded lyrical eye gives us presence. Glaring styles of representation and analysis, or those that take flight only at dusk, muffle the eloquent presence and passionate speech that calls philosophy, poetry, and religion into being.\n\n## How to read lyrical philosophy\n\nUnderstand what is said, how it is said, and how it affects your own sensibilities.\n\n\u003eI listen to what is said, how it is said, and how it elicits my own sensibilities and soul. What is said could be a simple declaration “Be yourself.” We get the dictionary meaning of each word if not a message. How it is said begins to fill in meaning beyond mere recitation of sounds. It might be rebuking (“Stop playing the clown!” Or, encouraging. “Just relax, you’ll do fine!”). Third, I might register my existential response. As I hear, “Be Yourself!” I might ask if I personally avoid—or embrace or am just baffled by “Be Yourself!”\n\u003e\n\u003eWe wonder if we sense what they sense\n\n## Philosophy needs passion and song\n\nPhilosophy needs passion because it is love, no friendship, of wisdom, and that friendship involves passion. Seen this way, argumentation, analysis, and debates in philosophy become secondary, not primary. This kind of philosophy involves not just the training of the mind to think and anlyze but the training of the senses\n\n\u003eIf philosophy infiltrates my passions, commitments, or desires—if it evokes passionate speech improvising in my soul—then it will not be lawyer-like argument, or analysis of social contracts, or debate about sense and reference. The exemplars of this wider sort of writing would include Rousseau’s Reveries of a Solitary Walker, Kierkegaard’s The Point of View of My Work as an Author, and Montaigne’s Essays. Philosophy needs passion and song, for it is, after all, a love story. Love of wisdom means attention to the fine textures of lives. It means love of a form of life suited to oneself and to others, in the light of the good, in the light of a love and life one can affirm in passionate speech.\n\u003e\n\u003edull vision or numbness toward ordinary life is imprisoning. Salvation is better seeing, imagining, and feeling. If we opened to revelations of “quite ordinary” reality, we’d die on the spot from the sublime roar. Ethics can tell us what might release the good as well as tell us how to restrain the bad. A vision of the “frequency” of life might do this.\n\n# The very tang of life: Lyrical jesting in Kierkegaard’s Postscript title\n\n## A complete philosophical account helps us understand and moves us\n\nEd Mooney quotes Heidegger: “Philosophy necessarily stands in the radiance of what is beautiful and in the throes of what is holy.” In other words, philosophy lies amidst the literary and the religious.\n\nMooney then argues that the philosopher's task is \"to write the drama of life as it is.\" To do this successfully, the philosopher must be able to communicate what actors \"say, think, and feel, but also what they are expressing.\" A successful philosophical account should provide a complete picture of life, different from the \"incompleteness\" of academic philosophy, which avoids discussion of passionate utterances. A complete philosophical account includes an answer to why, explains so the reader can understand, and the reader would be able to \"feel the very tang of life itself.\"\n\nReading a full account of the drama of life should make us \"feel the very tang of life itself.\" A philosopher who demonstrates this theatrical style of philosophical writing is Kierkegaard.\n\n\u003e“Philosophy necessarily stands in the radiance of what is beautiful and in the throes of what is holy.”\n\u003e\n\u003eIf the beautiful and the holy are part of the drama of life, we could say of a philosopher that he is trying to write the drama of life as it is, with all the stage directions, to express, not only what the actors do, say, think, and feel, but also what they are expressing. If one could succeed, the result would be life itself, completely known. We would see why, we would understand—and also, we would feel the very tang of life itself.\n\u003e\n\u003eMuch of Kierkegaard’s writing is a kind of theater. He tries “to express, not only what [his] actors do, say, think, and feel, but also what they are expressing in that doing, saying, thinking, and feeling.”\n\n## Lyrical philosophy stirs through message and medium\n\nEd says that lyrical philosophy has two effects: the bare message itself (the presence of words) piques our emotions but also the medium or the way the message was delivered (the presence of delivery) . Not all philosophers write this way, but if they do, their work lives in what Wittgenstein refers to as the inexplicit spirit of writing. Writers who moves readers through both the presence of words and their delivery include Schopenhauer, Plato, Kierkegaard, and Montaigne.\n\n(To do: Go back to the podcast interview about Stanley Cavell in the Philosopher's Zone).\n\n\u003eI can be stirred by the presence of what actors “do, say, think, and feel”—and by their presence in saying, doing, thinking, or feeing.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe words of love have a presence as words alone—as bare words. And in speaking, my tone of voice, its rhythm and timbre, and my bodily rigidity or slackness, can express a presence—fear, say, or hesitation or wholeheartedness. A court stenographer takes down words of a tearful witness. The bare words, and these alone, read later, can have a tearful presence. But the stenographer can’t convey the presence of delivery: the face of the witness; the tone, volume, and emotive modulations of the voice; the tightness of limbs betraying fear, excitement, or awkwardness. It’s like hearing subtleties beyond notes in musical phrasing.\n\u003e\n\u003ewords from my philosophy text can stir at two levels. I look for arguments and concepts relevant to an upcoming report and find myself sometimes moved by their eloquence. And occasionally these words (say, in Plato’s dialogues) can have a nearly voiced tangible weight, impact, pitch, rhythm—even overtones, bite, softness, or volume. Not all philosophers want to have their words come alive in diction or delivery.\n\u003e\n\u003eTo accept and convey both the presence of words and the presence of delivery is to live in what Wittgenstein calls the inexplicit “spirit” of writing.\n\u003e\n\u003eWittgenstein writes, “[The] Spirit of a book has to be evident in the Book itself, and can’t be described. It is a Great Temptation to try to make the Spirit Explicit,” in Culture and Value (New York: Blackwell, 1984), 6. By the book’s “spirit” he means the book’s presence.\n\u003e\n\u003eSchopenhauer or Plato, Kierkegaard or Montaigne, convey presence and spirit.\n\n## Lyrical philosophy suspends opinions and arguments to give way to the presence of words and their delivery\n\nOpinions and arguments are important but so is the presence of words and their delivery.\n\n\u003eI ask you to let Kierkegaard’s opinions and arguments be teleologically suspended, as it were. This lets the presence of words and of their delivery take center stage. We then access their “tang of life.” The presence of words and delivery is not more important than questions, concepts, or arguments. Nevertheless, it can be strikingly important.\n\u003e\n\u003eLike whispers or cries, an exclusively cognitive tracking of sentences recedes to let new vistas arise.\n\n## Live completely by letting go of the need to completely understand\n\nComplete knowledge is impossible. The tang of life is not a piece of knowledge. To fixate in the quest for knowledge narrows down life. We become alive because of the things we don't know.\n\n\u003eTo aim for complete understanding and knowledge is to aim for an unbecoming mirage rather than “the radiance of what is beautiful and … the throes of what is holy.” To aim for complete knowledge forestalls being swept up in terror or exaltation. “The tang of life itself” is not a piece of knowledge or understanding.\n\u003e\n\u003eTo fixate on the quest for knowledge narrows being alive (in more than a medical sense). To be vibrantly alive is to be animated by the unknown. Sports fans and players are alive because the outcome of a good match, or the outcome of the present pitch, is radically unknown.\n\n## Knowing how to live your life completely is impossible\n\n[[We learn to live while we are living]]. If [[Life is a project]], the greatest work of art, it is a project, an art work that is only finished in death. As the artist is alive, fully knowing how to live is impossible. [[Life is almost all about subjective experiences]].\n\n\u003eLife is unfinished, poised on the cusp of the new. No picture of completely known life can be drawn for it would necessarily leave out the living artist doing the drawing—whose life proceeds forward, outside the picture.\n\n## We can appreciate art without analysis\n\nPN\n\nA product of creativity possesses an inherent mystery. When faced with one, we don't know what it is. We don't have to look for this mystery. It is evident in the surface. There are two ways of engaging with this mystery: (1) We analyze it and treat it as a problem to solve or (2) we linger with it to see if it could have an unspoken effect on us. The former is an active engagement with the work, while the latter is a passive way of being with a work. If we are moved by it, we won't choose it.\n\nWhen faced with an image, a poem, or a prose, it might be helpful to allow yourself to enjoy it without the pressure to analyze. Analysis is paralyzing and could get in the way of really enjoying or even truly understanding a work. I remember DIY MFA, which mentioned that you need to analyze works of art you want to emulate but not all and not every element. So, when engaging with a work, let yourself be present with it, take note of things that jump to you. Return, but only analyze if truly called for. Otherwise, let the initial resonance suffice.\n\nBut this attitude can be applied not just in creations but in facts about the world or philosophical insights. Whenever we are struck by the wondrous surface of things (words, music, facts, truth), that moment of wonder is enough and the need to explain further may be unnecessary.\n\nLN\n\nMooney claims that a work can have an effect on us, or we can engage with it, without analysis (i.e., despite not knowing about the biography of its creator or its history). In fact, to be truly present with the work, we might need to intentionally let go of analysis. Mooney says \"the mysteries of creation lie on the surface,\" you don't have to get deep to witness them. Mooney seems to suggest that a work of art presents with it a particular \"mystery.\" This is obvious. When we encounter a work of art the first time, we know nothing about it. Mooney says you don't have to search for this mystery, it is evidently there on the surface. And the mystery is not something to be sold, it is something you linger into. Mooney clarifies that letting mystery take over does not mean being ignorant or shutting down questioning. It is giving space to wonder. An example of this in nature is that one does not need to learn about the name of the star to be affected by seeing its light.\n\nTo do\n- Connect James Klagge's discussion on Wittgenstein's idea that biography is important in philosophy.\n\n\u003eIn a museum, a landscape painting catches my eye. To take in more of it, I won’t rush to determine the painter’ dates or a critic’s view of technique.\n\u003e\n\u003eIn my attention to the presence or radiance of words I suspend biography and history.\n\u003e\n\u003eCreative power is evident despite our often knowing next to nothing about individuals responsible for a striking “tang of life.” The mysteries of creation lie on the surface.\n\u003e\n\u003ethe unfolding presence of a work doesn’t raise questions of provenance\n\u003e\n\u003eUnsigned bundles of words washed up on the beach, even if subsequently shown to be Kierkegaard’s, are as radiant before being linked to a Danish author as they are afterward.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe mystery of creation-underway is a presence to linger with, not a problem to solve. Taking up a problem is often optional\n\u003e\n\u003eBut being taken by a thrilling musical phrase, or seduced by the jest of a title, is not a matter of choice.\n\u003e\n\u003eWe can hear music without knowing the composer. If signed texts and pseudonymous ones are equally revelatory, we can stop with the revelations.\n\u003e\n\u003eMystery here is not simple ignorance nor a ploy to shut down questioning. It’s holding our breath in wonder or awe or fear, and not disposed of or overcome by better knowledge.\n\n## Five mysteries that give us the eff of the ineffable\n\nThere are five mysteries that gives the eff of the ineffable per Mooney.\n\n1. Act of love\n2. Birth of a baby\n3. Contemplation of great art\n4. Being in the presence of death or disaster\n5. Hearing the human voice lifted in song\n\n\u003eFive mysteries hold the keys to the unseen: the act of love, and the birth of a baby, and the contemplation of great art, and being in the presence of death or disaster, and hearing the human voice lifted in song. These are the occasions when the bolts of the universe fly open and we are given a glimpse of what is hidden; an eff of the ineffable.\n\n## Experience first explain later\n\nSimilar to [[Show, don’t tell]] in writing, we can do something similar in philosophy or in much of living in general.\n\nSee above We can appreciate art without analysis.\n\nIf you want other people to appreciate what you appreciate, be a facilitator by leading them to it and letting them experience it first rather than explaining it only.\n\nThe things that move us do not have to be explained. Explanations are available but things can move us even without explanations.\n\nHaving said this, what use then is art criticism? Even what Mooney himself is doing, commenting and explaining, or providing context to works of art and philosophy that moves him—what use are they?\n\nA more balanced approach is to let the work move people first, then only provide an explanation when asked or in the rarest of circumstances. Or, balance the two: provide the initial opportunity for human impact, then provide an explanation next.\n\nHow to apply this while walking? Be present. Try to be as present as you can. Allow yourself the opportunity to be moved by surface appearance. Only go deeper when necessary. But when is it necessary? And what does going deeper look like?\n\n\u003eFor a friend unmoved by what stuns me, descriptions or explanations are no substitute for direct access. I put her in the path of the ineffable rather than give her a tedious speech.\n\u003e\n\u003eFact-seeking or analytical frames of mind shut the door on presence and are only part of life-underway. I don’t need explanations for why I fall in love (though they might be available).\n\u003e\n\u003eExplaining is a digression from experiential impact. Moving too quickly to explain breaks the spell and risks explaining away.\n\u003e\n\u003enot that explanations can’t or shouldn’t be offered, but radiant impacts survive well enough without them.\n\u003e\n\u003eKierkegaard’s distain, in Postscript for “assistant professors,” is distain for those who stick to analysis or explanation and forget human impact.\n\n## Present explanations that do not diminish experience\n\nAfter experiencing, explanations are welcome. Take note: explanations, not explanation. Per Mooney, presenting multiple angles of the experience rather than skepticism or committing to a single perspective could help avoid the destruction of explanation.\n\n\u003eThe moment of wonder might be followed by a deferential desire for elaborations. They needn’t destroy the moment. They can lay out second or third angles of vision—giving what Wittgenstein calls “perspicuous representations.” He learned from Kierkegaard—among other things—how one could give multiple pictures of the lay of the land, shuffling them rather than fixating on a single picture. This is better than submitting to skepticism (“too many angles defeat knowledge”) and better than grasping one angle as surely correct.\n\nWhile in the process of being a medium to creation, we forget about ourselves. Our importance is diminished, even removed. Recollection might trigger feelings of awe on the self, which encountered what flowed. There are three ways of seeing one's creative work:\n1. The medium of a world flowing.\n2. The source and creator of a world flowing.\n3. The co-creator of a world flowing (some of it comes from nowhere; some comes from me).\n\nPer Mooney, if you take the first position, you the author becomes inessential.\n\nAt first appearance, it seems like Mooney is of the second position. However, he agrees that artists and writers create (i.e., they have agency to all or at least some of what they help bring forth).\n\n\u003eUndergoing the immediate impact of creation-underway can displace my importance. Now, as I write, I defer to the majesty of something appearing, apparently, from nowhere. On the other hand, looking back on my work, I might be in awe: it is I who encounter a sentence of my making. It’s my creation. Well, which is it? Am I a world-creator (as I write)—or, as I write, am I overcome by the majesty of a world? Focusing on the majesty of a world-written-out can make actual historical authors seem inessential.\n\u003e\n\u003eAuthorial disappearance is the flip side of boastful self-assertion. We shift between the writer as hero, as god-like in world-creation, and a world so magnificent the author disappears.\n\u003e\n\u003eAttributed to Rabbi Simcha Bunim of Peschischa: “Everyone must have two pockets, with a note in each pocket, so that he or she can reach into the one or the other, depending on the need. When feeling lowly and depressed, discouraged or disconsolate, one should reach into the right pocket, and, there, find the words: “For my sake was the world created.” But when feeling high and mighty one should reach into the left pocket and find the words: ‘I am but dust and ashes.’” Martin Buber, Tales of the Hasidim: Later Masters (New York: Schocken Books, 1948), 249.\n\u003e\n\u003eArtists and writers are generative centers of worlds they create. The world is made for them because they make it.\n\u003e\n\u003eYet writers also undergo self-abnegation. Kierkegaard keeps walking offstage to let his figures and pseudonyms speak on their own. He thinks, “The world was made for me,” and then, “I am dust and ashes.” He is the epitome of self-assertion and the epitome of self-emptying self-sacrifice.\n\u003e\n\u003eIn a sense it’s a miracle that you and I are here at all—that we exist! We matter, and that puts us one by one at the center of the universe. We know simultaneously that each of us can also seem as nothing\n\n## Unsorted\n\nKierkegaard wants to bypass objectivist philosophy by restoring a sense of the presence of words, selves, and the world. This is part of the broad project of romantic re-enchantment. For a wonderful discussion, see Antony Rudd, “Wittgenstein and Heidegger as Romantic Modernists,” in Wittgenstein and Heidegger, ed. Egan et. al. (Abingdon: Routledge, 2013).\n\n“Kierkegaard created [his novel] position by merging Hegel’s insistence that we must have some kind of contact with anything we can call real (thus rejecting the noumenal), with Kant’s belief that reality fundamentally exceeds our understanding; human reason should not be the criterion of the real. The result is the idea that our most vivid encounters with reality come in experiences that shatter our categories.”\n\nFrom Heidegger, *Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit*\n\n\u003e[H]ere as everywhere else in genuine philosophy—[the inner form] is not an addition which is meant for the literary connoisseur. Nor is the question that of literary decoration or of stylistic talent. Rather, its inner form [what I—EFM—call “presence”] is the inner necessity of the issue itself.\n\n\u003eFor philosophy is, like art and religion, a human-superhuman affair of primary and ultimate significance. Clearly separated from both art and religion and yet equally primary with both of them, philosophy necessarily stands in the radiance of what is beautiful and in the throes of what is holy.\n\n# Existentialism: Hardly navel-gazing\n\n## History of existentialism\n\nFrom being a vehicle to explore the meaning of life, personal morality, and faith during the postwar 1950s, existentialism became an angry mood of public protest in the 1960s.\n\n\u003eIn the 1950s, existentialism was a hot topic of cultured conversations.\n\u003e\n\u003eExistentialism was a mood as much as a philosophy, feeding on the ennui of the postwar years.\n\u003e\n\u003eBy the mid-1960s, however, the mood was shifting from quiet desperation to public protest.\n\u003e\n\u003eAs a cultural presence, existentialism was now overrun by the anger stirred by the Vietnam War, Civil Rights movement, and Black Power; it was then that the Weather Underground came into existence. The cachet of existentialism also declined in Europe, for parallel reasons: “deconstruction” advanced, and Emmanuel Levinas replaced Camus as the cultural figurehead. Dallying with meaning in life, personal morality, or faith was now a pastime for the effete.\n\u003e\n\u003eGordon Marino’s brilliant The Existentialist’s Survival Guide: How to Live Authentically in an Inauthentic Age\n\n## The personal is richly existential\n\nPersonal experience is fundamental. In writing existentialist text, you need to give witness to your own rich personal history.\n\n\u003eThe personal may be the political, as activists claim, but it is also the richly existential, and it is fundamental in its own terms. It is hardly navel-gazing or a preoccupation of the clinically depressed.\n\u003e\n\u003eAs important for an existential account of the subject, Marino honors its deeply personal appeals, and he is adept at giving witness to fragments from his own rich personal history.\n\u003e\n\u003eexistentialism is also literary\n\n## Existentialism's champions, per Marino\n\nKierkegaard\nNietzsche\nCamus\nSartre\n\nErich Fromm\nRollo May\nErik Erikson\n\n## To have anxiety shows you take your life seriously\n\n\u003eKierkegaard identified anxiety as central to any identity worth the name. It rises to a high pitch when we ask: “How can I be the person I truly am and should be?” To have anxiety here shows I take my life seriously.\n\n## Existentialism is personal\n\n\u003eClasses in existentialism and existential psychology are popular because, apart from vocational promises, they offer a personal relevance all too absent in lectures devoted solely to impersonal facts and techniques.\n\n## Always integrate your moods and feelings to your self-understanding\n\n\u003ethere’s an existential inescapability of faith-as-trust, theistic or otherwise, that survives despite declines in church membership and the polemics of “the New Atheists.” Faith is a passion, not a litany of facts, and we can credit existentialists with the insight that eliminating moods and feelings from our self-understandings will also eliminate courage, hope, a sense of right and wrong, and a sense of personal resolution.\n\n## Sharpen sensibilities not systematic analysis\n\nPer Mooney, a full existentialist life is not devoting oneself to systematically understanding the existential dimensions of life. It is about \"sharpening our sensibilities\" to these dimensions. Use philosophy, music, art, and literature to sharpen these sensibilities.\n\n\u003eA full life I can call my own is not derivative, and it will ferry dark moods and also celebrations and loves, moral courage and kindness. If there’s a place for anger and moral outrage, there’s also a place for good-heartedness and neighbor-love. Attention to existential dimensions of living, and full incorporation of them, is not a devotion to systematic knowledge and technical analysis. It’s acknowledging and sharpening our sensibilities to the moods and agitations we live with willy-nilly. We get a feel for them through philosophy, music, art, and literature. They stretch and refine our sensibilities. To acknowledge the varieties and vagaries of anxiety and meaning, of courage, authenticity, and compassion, is at the heart of any existentialist portrait of what it means to be human\n\n# Henry Bugbee, religious philosopher\n\nBugbee is relatively unknown. Like Thoreau before him, he was always more than a scholar and teacher. He was committed to living a spiritual-philosophical life. For him, philosophy is not a technical research discipline but an unending exploration of life—of his life and its place among other lives and among beings of nature. Professional prominence mattered little. Paramount was living philosophically—even religiously. His writing is often lyrical, letting life sing its multiple sufferings and joys. In many ways Bugbee is Thoreauvian. This happy intermingling of thought, living, and writing is in stark contrast with the Anglophone philosophical style that began to dominate the post–Second World War era: something dryly professional, technical, and irrelevant to the spiritual and personal lives of its practitioners or others.\n\nBorn February 19, 1915, in New York City, Bugbee received his BA in philosophy from Princeton in 1936.\n\n“In Demonstration of the Spirit” as an honors thesis\n\nHe started graduate work in philosophy in California at Berkeley, where he intended to study aesthetics.\n\nHis writing always engaged literary narratives, including scriptural narratives. For him, reason-only expositions were secondary.\n\nHis graduate work was interrupted by Pearl Harbor. He joined the Navy, serving as captain of a minesweeper in the Pacific.\n\nAfter the War, Bugbee returned to Berkeley, completing a PhD in 1948 under Jacob Loewenberg. Its fearless title was “The Sense and Conception of Being.” Hired initially by Stanford, he was quickly called to Harvard, where he taught from 1948 to 1954. He was denied tenure. He had no interest in writing strictly professional essays. He took a year off to draft The Inward Morning: A Philosophical Exploration in Journal Form. This was in the tradition of Gabriel Marcel’s Metaphysical Journals and Thoreau’s Journals, two writers he deeply admired.\n\nAfter leaving Harvard in 1954, he put down roots among Montana’s Bitterroot Mountains where he taught philosophy and humanities at the University of Montana from 1957 to 1977. He died in Missoula in December 1999.\n\nHe was at home with the Americans James, Royce, and Hocking, but this era expired after 1945. A new style emerged in the 1950s and 1960s—the British analytical style embodied by Russell, Moore, and Ryle. The new American brand was led by Quine, C. I. Lewis, Carnap, and Putnam. This sort of philosophy aspired to the clarity and decisiveness of math and science. It lacked the reflective, unfinished personal intimacy that Bugbee so valued. For him, philosophy was meditative, a dialogical endeavor rather than argumentative or didactic. He took leads from Shakespeare, Thoreau, and Zen rather than from the logic of Quine, Russell, or Moore. He was unimpressed with competitive intellectual styles. He sought reflective insight, a day at a time.\n\nOver the years Bugbee’s wrote on Marcel, the Book of Job, wilderness, the sublime, love, and education. None of this was of mainstream interest. He sought the sacred and revelatory in texts and wilderness, and sought to embody their lessons.\n\nBugbee’s undergraduate philosophy thesis from Princeton, “In Demonstration of the Spirit,” takes its title from 1 Corinthians 2:4\n\nEven at this early stage, Bugbee refused to construe philosophy as providing a solely technical, cognitive grip. He rejects what Corinthians disparagingly calls “wise and persuasive words.” He writes from a spiritual calling rather than from academic protocols. Bugbee’s bibliography lists, of all things, the classical recordings that he reports were essential in feeding his spirit. Without this music, he says, the thesis would not have been possible. Even more astonishing, the last word of the thesis is a handwritten “Amen.” Has this been a prayer? Or a sermon? This is no standard undergraduate philosophy thesis.\n\nBugbee’s handwritten “Amen” seals his anomalous wedding of the philosophical and the religious. He doesn’t argue that prayer and liturgy are deeper than reasoned analysis can ever be. And this is not an undergraduate blunder. The writing is impressively mature. Bugbee knows he is not writing within a seminarian community. He knows he challenges the presumptions of a secular university. His title, benediction, and musical acknowledgments abandon us in an anomalous zone where philosophy and scripture, wisdom and revelation, spirit and reason, intermix. The thesis violates a taboo. Academic philosophy can’t be mixed with confessional, religious meditation. This is a kind of civil disobedience—knowingly breaking a law to make a deep spiritual point. Bugbee’s chapters on art and religion unfold appropriately for academic readers, yet they lie side by side with the closing “Amen,” and with the opening biblical quotation. A taboo is broken in the name of a forgotten spirit in philosophy, a spirit that walked with the Divine.\n\nDecades after his dissertation, Bugbee continues a mix of philosophy and religion. “A Way of Reading the Book of Job” is philosophical reflection and religious meditation. It displays Bugbee’s reflective poetic prose, and his uncanny ability to be simultaneously philosophical, literary, and religious.\n\nBugbee’s meditative account opens in an unstudied voice—the tone of the tavern storyteller, sharing a yarn with a friend.\n\nThis is the idiom and tone of the village. He’s not talking down from an academic or pastoral podium as a member of a learned elite.\n\nDreams are timeless but require intervals for interpretation to marinate. Philosophical arguments may have timeless validity, but they abandon the ups and downs of the heart. The abstracted writer becomes disincarnate, beyond place, mood, or voice. But Bugbee has heart, mood, and place voiced.\n\nThis showing-of-things-happening embodies a patient readiness and receptivity.\n\nHe works seamlessly with his text as partners work seamlessly in common tasks with no need for flourishes—only steady attention to the task, and quiet awareness of we who are present.\n\nDated entries mark a day’s labor. The harvest is sentences, unmistakably his, delivered from a particular life, at a particular time and season, from a particular place. He places us to sense that the voice of things is heard only as we listen from a place of quiet\n\nAt the core of personal life there seems to be something inviolately impersonal, akin in our fashion to the mode of being of rose, or rock—known and owned by all weather. It is through this in us that the elements seem most deeply to befriend us—sun and rain, earth and seasons, the constant rivers and the starry night. It is through this that one may “go and come with a strange liberty in Nature, a part of herself.” And it is this as well which may ground and fortify both critical reserve and human warmth: something inviolately impersonal.\n\nUnderstanding does not fulfill philosophy’s promise of secure cognitive grasp but comes to pass “through a glass darkly.” To be by the hearth and see the nearness of snow etched against trees is not philosophical knowledge or explanation but a reception-of-happenings, happenings that deliver revelatory understanding. Philosophy becomes poetic\n\nHe wants not just a conception of being but a sense of being peculiar to one’s place.\n\nThe Inward Morning delivers wilderness, art, philosophy, and responsive receptivity in journal explorations. Shakespeare and Melville, as well as Plato, Eckhart, and Spinoza, make cameo appearances. The impressive reach of Bugbee’s reading is reminiscent of Stanley Cavell, who held a fellowship at Harvard during Bugbee’s time there. Cavell’s readings of King Lear, Thoreau, Emerson, film, and opera are indicative of a transcendence of disciplinary specialization he shares with Bugbee.\n\nWhat is an instruction that can’t be told? But it is precisely his unassuming yet profound admission of ignorance that keeps us listening. We can hazard a response he hesitates to utter. He’s caught between knowledge and revelation, between provincial wisdom and sublime Spirit. He has no proposition, adage, or simple counsel to print out. Nevertheless, his definitive appreciation is counsel, teaching. The instruction received is to be receptive to the cry of hawks and presence of rocks\n\nFor Bugbee, philosophy is “an approximation to a poem,” wed to the local and individual—a walking meditation that is ineluctably first person.\n\nPhilosophical problems incarnate are now my meditation. Philosophical problems disincarnate no longer exert much pull on me. Perhaps what I have come to appreciate more fully is that there is a strict specificity about philosophical problems—they exist only in a specific person and they can be grappled with only in conjunction with that person and they can be solved—in whatever sense they are solved—only by that person. Philosophical problems arise from and are only finally responsive to the living experience of a specific person.\n\n==A disincarnate speaking to all-and-nobody derails the quest for personal meaning that should be the calling of philosophy and, in a wider sense, the calling of a mortal human life.\n\nHis is a walking beholding in whom incarnate spirit is addressed by things that themselves incarnate spirit. Each is bound to the other in discrete address. It’s not just humans who speak. Trees speak and bespeak. Thus, philosophy’s musings and reflections come to resemble “a walking meditation of the place.” This is a prayer-like receptivity infinitely responsive to the tissues and fissures of our being in the world.\n\n# References\n\nMooney, E.

Once known, it is enough that you know it. You don't return to the text.\n\nIn lyrical philosophy, lyric serves philosophy, so that a philosophical statement becomes more beautiful and therefore appeals more to emotions.

    "content": "\nThe problem with a brand is that it will cage a person and prevent change. A brand should be iterative especially at the beginning when the owner of it hasn’t really figured out who he is. One needs some semblance of it though as one needs to connect to people and people will always ask what one does or aspires to do.\n\nThus, a brand is necessary, but just a bare minimum of it especially at the beginning. A good rule is to differentiate the things one is sure of and those one is not yet sure of. Another good rule is to avoid declarations like “This is what I will do…” Granted, statements like these could resonate strongly with an ideal audience. But if the creator fails to uphold and follow through, the consequences will be worse.\n\nIt is better to avoid creating one’s cage and allow the organic process of creating to lead the way to one’s true identity.\n\nThis is related to [[thoughts/tiago forte]]’s admotion to delay commiting to something until the last minute.\n\nHere is [[My minimum viable brand]].\n\n# To do\n\n- Flesh out smaller notes.\n\n# Related\n\n[[Some brands are content agnostic]]\n\n",

    "title": "My best future self exercise (2020 version)",
    "content": "\nDepression has been a foreign concept to me. I can no longer remember what it feels like. It's as if it never happened. I am completely free from prescription and psychotropic drugs. I have the healthiest brain and mind I could ever have. I have replaced all my bad habits with good habits. I live an active lifestyle. I engage with physical activity every single day, which balances my intellectual work. I have more positive energy every day. I feel vibrant and energetic every single day. I have the best body I could ever have. I feel deep inner peace every single day, from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep. Today, like any other day, I wake up feeling like my best. I had nine hours of sleep last night because I have prioritized good sleep for many years already and I can no longer live without it. I am mentally sharp, ready to take on my day. My partner has woken up before me. She is an early riser and is already performing her own set of morning routine: doing yoga, drinking ACV, journaling, and exercising. She does this to prioritize her well-being before the kids wake up.\n\nI fix my bed and went straight to her to give her a kiss. I am so fortunate to be loved by a loving, emotionally mature, beautiful, intelligent, and supportive wife who inspires me every day to show up and also be the best version of myself. Our relationship is thriving. I talk to her in a peaceful, nonviolent way, and I’m able to express my feelings in a way that she hears me. She is able to do the same to me. We approach misunderstandings maturely and peacefully. I can't remember when the last time we fought. We do disagree on certain subjects but we have mastered how to talk to each other effectively in such a way that we leave each disagreement with a deeper understanding of each other's values. Both of us feel safe and inspired in the relationship. Our relationship is built on trust, communication, respect, and deep love for each other. We remain close while at the same time preserving each other’s need for personal time and space. We grow together and we support each other.\n\nAfter kissing and hugging my beautiful wife, I went straight ahead to starting my day. I too have my morning rituals to honor before I face the world and the pursuit of my goals and dreams. First, I made sure I drank two glasses of water and a spoon of ACV before continuing. Then, like I have been doing for 15 years now, I stood on my yoga mat to perform a few asanas that I have mastered and which have constantly nurtured the needs of my body. I have a dedicated space, an altar of sorts, in the house where my yoga mat is placed. The room is a little dim with natural light coming inside it. Sunlight on my face and parts of my body, I curl, fold, and bend my limbs and torso as I breathe in and out fresh, clean, rejuvenating air. After the asanas, I lied on my back in savasana for 20 minutes, just counting my breath and being in the present moment. My mindfulness practice is so solid. My mind still wanders (it's what it does); but it does so very minimally. Around 80% or more of the time, I maintain my focus on my breathing, feeling the sensation of each in-breath and out-breath and being grateful for the breath of life I was given today. My yoga and meditation practices have transformed me into someone who resides in the present moment. This has made it possible for me to maintain happiness and emotional stability most days. Happiness and ginhawa are my default emotions. And even on days when things are not ideal, I am still able to return easily to this inner home of peace.\n\nAfter savasana, I sat on my mat and grabbed my five-minute journal. First, I wrote three things I am grateful for. It has been a practice I have established for more than ten years already, and it has given me emotional sustenance every day since. After writing one entry, I reflected further what it meant for me, why it happened to me, and what I can do to have more of it in the future. This exercise reveals how much richness of meaning there is in even the smallest things in life, and it provides me with a regular boost of thankfulness for everything I have, no matter how small.\n\nAfter doing my gratitude practice, I opened the Things app on my phone to see what the day has in store for me. I identified at least two important tasks that would require more time, effort, and attention from me. I wrote these down on my journal. I also took a mental note of other things I can still do after accomplishing my most important tasks. Finally, to end my five-minute journal, I wrote an affirmation: \"I am full of Ginhawa each and every day of my life.\"\n\nAfter writing on my five minute journal, I got up from my mat and walked to my study room. There, I grabbed the poetry book I was reading (Robert Frost's complete poems), Thoreau's journal, my diary, my pen, and a pencil. I placed everything inside a small knapsack. I also changed for outdoor clothes. I walked out of the door and into the path that lead to the hill in our estate where I like to spend my morning reading and writing. It is cool outside but the sun is slowly providing some warmth. As I walked towards the hill, I saw our cows slowly waking up from the sound of a few of our roosters. I saw that one of our cows, Lulu, has given birth to a new baby calf last night. I checked on the baby for a while then continued my walk. Bird songs abound. Flowers have colored the field. The sky is mackarel as the night and day is slowly parting. When I reached the hill, I lied down on my back to breath the fresh air for a little while. Then I sat back up to read one poem from Robert Frost's collection. After reading the poem, I looked at the horizon and savored every bit of Frost's pastoral words. His words nurture me as I live my own pastoral life in our estate. Then I brought out Thoreau's journal from my knapsack. I browsed and read all of his entries for this day, July 17, 2030. It's good to revisit Thoreau year after year even after I have published a book of his journal entries translated in Filipino, featuring the best nature photos I have taken in my hometown.\n\nAfter this, I started writing on my diary. I described how good I was feeling in the moment. I let flow some ideas I have been thinking in the past days and developed them a little bit more. Then to end my entry for the day, I drew a little blue kingfisher who has perched on a rock near me, unafraid of my presence. I watched him intently as I drew and colored his image on the page. I will be posting my drawing on my blog when I get home.\n\nAfter the kingfisher flew, I got up and walked back home, where from afar I saw my two kids starting their morning lessons. We have been trying a more self-directed learning philosophy in our homeschooling adventure. My boy and girl talks with their mom about their plans for the day and asks advice if they need it before they embark on each other's chosen learning activity. As I reached the porch where they are just wrapping up their plans with their mother, I kissed and hug both of my little kids. I asked them what they're up to today. The boy hastily answered he will be joining a neighbor to learn about bamboos - choosing the right ones, cutting them, and crafting them. He said he wanted to build a bookshelf for himself. I told him if he could also make one for me. He said he'll think about it. The girl was on a rush. She'll be joining one of her titas (a good friend of ours) to put up an organic vegetable booth at the community Sunday market. Our friend is coming early and my girl needs to prepare. I said okay and have fun. I did remind the two of them about our scheduled nature walk in the afternoon with family and friends. I usually do this by myself but I'm taking the entire gang today to share my love of nature with the important people in my life.\n\nMy wife told me she'll be talking with one of the students at our self-directed learning center. The student is asking for some advice and these stuff are my wife's forte. We launched the center just a year ago after seeing the need for one in our immediate community. We think our kids will need it too. We provide resources for self-directed learning children and their parents as well as social support. It's a realization of a dream my wife had since she was still single and the center also became a sandbox for my \"life philosophy\" ideas. I told her good luck and she told me to remember that I'll be facilitating a punk art drawing class on Wednesday. I said I don't have to remember. It's already in my calendar. I kissed her again and went back inside to my study.\n\nMy study room has a large window, which I keep open for the fresh cold air and the ambient sounds of nature. I stood for a while in front of the window. I closed my eyes and breathe the air. I felt it run to the farthest shores of my lungs. I then looked at the scenery outside. Just beneath my window is our family's garden, a labor of love where flowers and medicinal herbs abound. In the horizon is the beautiful blue mountain range, which isn't as blue this morning because the sun has stripped it off its blue gown and its beautiful dark green and brown facade is showing. There are a few clouds in the sky and the mackerel color is all but gone; the royal blue has filled the canvas. I feel so grateful for living in such a paradise. I am so grateful to have eyes that devour such beauty. I then listened intently to the soundscape. I hear the bato-bato (native pigeons), the sikling (wild fowl), and some other migrant birds. Their songs create a melodious harmony filled with the rustling of leaves in between. I feel so grateful for getting my perfect hearing back and for getting over tinnitus. I have been tinnitus-free for a while already and I am able to enjoy the soundscape every day. As I walked away from the window to my standing desk, I savored this feeling of connection to nature and this deep gratitude for being able to live in a place that nurtures my mind and body.\n\nI stood there on my standing desk where my laptop is. I opened it and went directly to the Notion page where I have left of. I am currently writing a book on the history of people with disabilities in the Philippines. Before I started writing, I looked around my office. My shelf is filled with my most favorite books. I have read all of them and have reread some. Some are the best reference books I've found and continue to use. At the top of my shelf are the books I have already written in the past ten years: a book on my life philosophy, a compilation of my Filipino translations of my favorite Thoreau journal entries, and the first high fantasy novel written in Pangasinan. After this quick scan of my office, I felt another jolt of gratitude for all the work I have done and the work that is in front of me. I looked at the clock: 9:00 am. Just in time. I'll be writing in my office until lunch and so I started.\n\nIt's easy for me to enter flow when writing because my mind and body is healthy and my working environment is conducive for creativity. I have enough silence and ambient sound to put me into an ideal mental state. The temperature inside my study room is cool and I am relaxed. I am standing up so blood flow and breathing is great. I have the best studio office for my creative tendencies. Furthermore, I have found a work structure that works great for me. Instead of forcing myself to focus in one large block of time, I work in short spurts of 20-25 minutes. Take some rest. And get back to what I am doing until the clock strikes 12. By lunch time, I have written a good amount of pages, some notes, and read a few resources that I could let percolate in my head as the day progresses to trigger new ideas, connections, and prompts for tomorrow's writing.\n\nBy lunch, I walked out of my office and into the gazebo we built near the garden. There is a small artificial stream we constructed so I can hear the flow of water while I smell my wife's cooking. The kids were already around the table when I came. Both of them helping their mom set the table. My wife cooked a simple but nutritious meal that would nourish our family for the entire day. She prepared some greens she herself grew and harvested from our gardens. My son, who recently learned how to fish and cook, prepared grilled and steamed fish for us. I feel so proud of him. I never learned the skills he has when I was his age. I felt grateful that we are guiding them in a path that really allows their strengths and personalities to flourish. Our daughter, on the other hand, prepared a tasty dessert she also recently learned from the baking lessons she's taking with a local baker. Her baking strategy is radical as it only uses organic ingredients and less sugar. Despite this, I find her pastries really yummy. I might try baking one of these days!\n\nAfter uttering some words of thanks to the universe for bringing these foods on our family's table, I led our family to hearty eating. As we enjoyed the rich taste of the provisions, we each shared what happened in our morning. My son reported how he's amazed about what a great plant bamboo is, while my daughter shared how the market looked this morning. She said more and more people in our community are purchasing organic and healthy vegetables, realizing how nutrition is so significant in their health. This is good news. It's good to be living in a community of healthy people.\n\nAfter eating lunch, we all walked towards the large tree near the wide grazing field. My wife laid down a large blanket where we all lied down together looking up at the tree's branches while we all doze to sleep. I heard a few snores here and there.\n\nBy about 2 pm, I stood up and went back home to get my towel and soap. My wife and children were still sharing some stories while lying down under the tree when I left them. With towel and soap (organic too) on hand I walked towards the river that runs along our estate. I removed my shirt and with only boxer shorts I dipped into the water. The river is deep enough to allow some swimming. I submerged myself inside the water for a few seconds then emerged back. I feel grateful for having my eardrum back to normal. Ten years ago, I couldn't dive in water for fear it would go inside my inner ear and damage whatever's left in my broken hearing system. Today, I have a healthy eardrum, which I take good care of. I am able to dive and swim like I was able to do before. I rubbed my skin with some soap and rinsed with the clear cold water that streams fast. There were some small fishes.\n\nAfter taking a bath, I went back home to dress up and prepare. We are expecting our visitors to come early before our scheduled nature walk. As I approached the porch, I wasn't mistaken. Rem and Jay Vee are already at the porch talking to each other. I run towards the two of them and hugged each one. We shared some funny and thought-provoking conversations. I am so happy that these two became good friends as I was to each of them. I was only what connected them at first, but as they got to know each other, they both shared a bond comparable to what I have to each of them.\n\nBy 2:30 my wife approached us together with Jay Vee's wife and Claire, Rem's wife. They were also sharing friendly chats and catched up while I was talking with their husbands. My wife told me that merienda was ready and that my parents and sisters as well as her siblings and mom have all arrived. With them are their spouses and children. They’re ready to meet us at the river's shore were my wife and my friends' wives have prepared some chairs for the old and some picnic blankets for the younger. While we walked towards the shore, I saw that my mother and father were sitting on the chairs along with their balae and were already sharing a laugh. My two sisters were also laughing together with my wife's siblings. My nieces and nephews are running around the soft grass looking for dragonflies and beetles. Everyone was smiling, everyone was happy to share a beautiful environment, stories, and some good food. I kissed all of my parents and siblings. Hugging them too. My kids then arrived bringing with them the refreshments they prepared. They kissed and hugged their grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins and we all sat around a circle, while my wife's sister started playing the ukulele and singing a song everyone was familiar with. We sang together in unison, hugging each other.\n\nWhile we were all singing, our neighbors who we have been bestfriends with and their kids also arrived and joined the singing. Some of our closest friends in the community also came, bringing some yummy food to share to everyone. Rem, being the great facilitator that he is, guided everyone through a sharing of stories, nurturing words, and creative ideas. Everyone was listening to everyone, sincerely interested, and ready to support to each other's thoughts. My son and daughter shared what they were currently learning. The grandparents listened intently and promised to support our children's choices, even offering help by whatever means they can. Their aunts and uncles said the same. I am so grateful to be surrounded by such like-minded and like-hearted people I love and can rely on.\n\nBy 4 pm, Rem announced that we'll be starting our nature walk and he introduced me to say a few words about the trail we will be walking on. I stood up and talked to our family and friends with the usual humor and wit that I have developed through the years. I asked everyone especially the older guests if they would want to come. They have an option to stay if their health won't allow it and my son and daughter would make sure they're in good company. My father spoke up and said that I shouldn't underestimate his legs. This made everyone laugh. I am grateful that even at old age, my parents and mother-in-law are all strong, healthy, and still able to enjoy what the world has to offer. So with that, we all rose up and started walking. Everyone followed me as we entered the dirt path that leads to a forest trail covered by a thick canopy of trees with some holes for sunlight to get through. The trail was filled with flowers, rare plants, rare birds, and sounds of nature. I am so happy I get to share my love for nature with the most important people in my life.\n\nWhile walking with friends, family, and neighbors, I looked behind me and saw all those smiling faces. I am so grateful to share happiness with the people important in my life. I am so grateful that I have a close, satisfying, and loving relationship with mama, papa, my siblings, and a few of my relatives. While we have a lot of differences, I am able to talk and listen to them in a nonviolent way that reassures them of my love to them. I spend enough quality time with them every month and take care of them whenever they need me. This walk is one such way of showing them that. I also feel so grateful for being surrounded by healthy friends who are very warm and supportive. They inspire me to be the best version of myself. In these relationships, I am able to fully express myself - my innermost doubts and desires. When I have a problem, I know I can always approach these people and when they are troubled, they always approach me. I also feel deep joy and happiness to have shared strong friendships with my neighbors. When we bought this estate a few years back, I never really expected having these good neighbors. But I have them and I feel grateful for them. I have good relationships with my neighbors and I try to be the kindest, most compassionate, and most empathetic person I can be whenever I am around them. I try my best to do the same whenever I'm in town and around complete strangers. I have developed genuine love to everyone, no matter who they are, where they come from, and what they do to me. In our local community and communities around the country, I am actively involved in several groups that nurture my deepest passions and interests. I get and give support in these communities where I bond with like-minded people in achieving our vision. Overall, I am so happy that I have embraced imperfections in my life. I have worked on myself to develop healthier and more realistic expectations in all my relationships. I feel connected, every day, to nature and other human beings, and I am inspired to act in a way that reflects that oneness.\n\nBy 6 pm, everyone in the group reached the end of the trail. I can see that everyone’s face have turned pinkish from the cardio they got from our walk. The older ones are breathing a little heavily, finding a soft foam of grass to sit on. But everyone was happy. I was successful in entertaining them along the walk, sharing with them my knowledge about the different flora and fauna they saw on the trail. The end of the trail is a wide cliff that overlooks the entire natural landscape of our community: rich rainforests, waterfalls, fresh streams, hills, meadows, and, in the horizon, the great mountain ranges. The sky have turned mackerel red, with strips of neon blue, and patches of thin clouds. The sun is slowly making its descent. Like I have always done for ten years, I stood there looking at this giant ball of fire walk down on its staircase behind the mountains. But today, I was hugging my wife on one arm and my two kids on the other, while my family and friends stood behind me, also awestruck by the beauty that was in front of them.\n\nThe sunset marked the start of the end of another beautiful day filled with gratitude. As we all made the walk back to the house, the moon lighted our path. Some of our friends stopped for a while to look at the sky, which was now filled with innumerable silver stars. We reached the house by 7 pm. We invited our friends and family to have dinner with us but some of them had to make a long trip home so they declined. I hugged my friends and saw them off in their cars. My parents, siblings, nephews, and nieces (mine and my wife’s) are all staying for the night though, so what ensued was another beautiful evening of laughter, good food, music, and kind words.\n\nBy 9 pm, our wife’s relatives are ready to sleep. My kids are sleeping with their cousins outside under the starry sky inside tents, so we accompanied them and watched them build their own tents. My bayaws volunteered to watch over the kids, so they put up tents for themselves. The estate was large enough for all these camping! Our parents and sisters though had other plans. They wanted to try our guest cottages, which me, my wife, and the kids built with our own hands for this very reason. They are eco-domes we built using earth bags. From afar, they looked like beautiful beehives. Inside, they are naturally cold and cozy, matching the temperature of their outside environment. I can’t describe my mother's and mother-in-law's faces when they first saw the houses. They think they’re so cute! My parents thanked me and my wife for a wonderful day and shut the door of their little hive ready to retire. My wife was hugging her mother tight, both of them teary-eyed, joyful for spending a memorable day together. We hugged our sisters who were all joining my wife’s mom in the other hive. The lights inside my parents’ hive were off, but those inside my mother-in-law’s and sisters’ will probably be open for quite a while. I held my wife’s hand as we walked back together hearing some chuckles from the latter hive.\n\nWe reached the house at around 9:30 pm. My wife and I sat down on the sofa. She opened a bottle of red wine and poured a glass for each of us. We sat down, first, silent, then a conversation on how beautiful this day was ensued, savoring everything that happened.\n\n“Wait, we have one last quick thing to do.” She brought out her laptop and opened up the financial management app we use. “We need to do a monthly financial review.” Since we’ve streamlined our processes using the best apps and systems, we were able to quickly see where our financial lives have been in the past month. It was no surprise but reassuring to know that despite the profound sense of fulfillment our family is experiencing every day, we actually are consuming less and needing less material and financial resources. My wife and I are both semi-retired. We still are running some lifestyle businesses but we spend very little time each month thinking about generating money because we have simplified our lives, put up investments and passive incomes that allow us to enjoy time affluence and creative freedom. During our monthly financial review, we also get to remember how fortunate we are to both be engaged in livelihoods that are both creative, contributive, and fulfilling. We both have developed important life skills that make us less dependent to the market economy, more resilient, and more useful in our community. Skills like gardening, cooking, food processing and preservation, fishing, carpentry, crafts, and technical online skills, among others.\n\nAfter our financial review, my wife told me she was feeling a little sleepy so she'll go to bed now. I told her I'll join her soon. As I'm alone on the sofa, I can only hear the repeating chirp of cicadas outside. I stood up from the table and walk out the porch. I closed my eyes for a while to listen to the soundscape of this cold summer evening. Then I raised my head up and looked at the stars. Looking at the stars, I felt awe. I again realized, as I always do, how fortunate I am to be alive at this very moment. I didn't ask for it but somehow, someway in a process that we still don't fully grasp, the forces of nature moved to create a universe, a solar system, a planet, that is conducive to life. And along that long history of life, as if by accident, I was born to taste some of it. Since I was a child, I knew of this grand mystery of life and it continued to baffle me in adulthood. It ignited a continuous journey to learn about the universe, about myself, about life. Today, though I continue to have unanswered questions, I have a better grasp of truth and I live my life attuned with what I believe to be true. I am contributing to the creation of a better world. I am living a lifestyle that embodies my beliefs and visions of a better world.\n\nAs I walked to bed, I am reminded of the work that is in front of me. I am just about to turn 40. If I am fortunate, I still have about 30 good years ahead of me. I can still make a lot of difference in the world. I remembered what is in store for me in the coming days: I'll be posting on my personal blog [vinceimbat.com](http://vinceimbat.com/), which houses my personal quest, mission, and creative projects. A few significant people follow me and I am able to inspire them through the work that I do. In it, I continue to document my lifestyle through writing, photography, and other art forms. I do this to inspire and teach others how they can build the best life for themselves. I also remember that I have an upcoming one-on-one session with a young man I am mentoring at our self-directed learning center. I am advising him on philosophy, poetry, and nature appreciation. I also have a day dedicated to volunteering. One of our friends is building a permaculture community garden nearby. I'll be helping out this week by providing labor and some money for his cause. Later this week, I will also be facilitating a punk art class with a small circle of adult learners in our community. Next month, I will be conducting a nature retreat with self-directed learning teenagers and some adults. I also have an upcoming fieldwork with a travel buddy. I am reminded of the list of books I want to read and the list of skills I want to learn.\n\nAs I lay down in bed and kiss my wife goodnight, I felt immense gratitude of another wonderful day. And I am even feeling more gratitude knowing that I have the power to repeat the same beauty tomorrow. I am living a very creative life. Every day, I allow myself to play and be absorbed with things and activities that allow me to be a child once more. Every day, I experience flow - the feeling of captivating presence that’s a result of engaging into learning, art, and creative expression. I go to sleep every day feeling that my life is amazingly colorful - happiness to the brim!\n\n---\n\nThis exercise was from [[Caroline Adams Miller]]'s book “Creating Your Best Life.”\n\n# References\n\nAdams Miller, C., \u0026 Frisch, M.

They have to be engaged in actual, real-life application of the knowledge they produce from their intellectual activity. They have to have a [[inbox/Practice]].\n5. The field has to feel like it is balanced in the attention it gives to theory and practice. People here are engaged in activities that resemble [[thoughts/use-inspired basic research]].\n6. The field has to have publication channels established, which also implies that it has an audience I can tap when I am ready (see [[Cautious sharing process]]).\n7. This isn't the most important but it would make things a lot easier: the community has to be likable.\n\nUsing these criteria, I have decided that [[My field is practical philosophy]].

My ideal mentors and peers should be have an intellectual practice, they are proponents of [[thoughts/intentional living]] and [[thoughts/contemplation]], and they share their knowledge and experiences through writing and/or other art forms.\n2. I want my mentors and peers to favor [[thoughts/process over product]]. They balance thinking and being, that is, they are very good thinkers but they also have a consciousness practice, or espouse [[thoughts/intentional living]]. They need to have a strong consciousness practice but are also very good in thinking about the world. They are engaged in serious, deep thinking about life. They don’t have to be a philosopher per se, but they should be really intentional about how they understand the world as demonstrated by their writings. But they don’t just research. They apply their philosophical insights in their daily life ([[thoughts/use-inspired basic research]]). They are intent in living an \"ethical life.\"\n3. They must have a dedicated practice of building a philosophy of their own.\n4. Ideally, the main question they ask is, [[thoughts/how should I live?]] or [[thoughts/how to live?]]\n5. While excellent thinkers whose reasoning skills are well-developed, they express themselves beautifully in writing. They use personal narrative and poetical language. They also show interest in other artistic art forms.\n6. They write books, published or to be published.\n7. They write from the first person. They write about their personal philosophical and contemplative journey. They present their thought processes. The form of their writing is tracing the trails of their thoughts, not necessarily beautiful language.\n8. The best mentors (at least those I plan to interact with) should be alive.\n9. (Optional) Does poetry and photography.\n\nIn short, I want an autobiographical writer who writes about their attempt to understand the universe and act on that understanding.\n\nHere is a [[thoughts/list of peers and mentors]] I have encountered in research or real life.\n\n",

In terms of what I need right now as a writer, I think my recent AILAP experience was perfect. Iff this is my first national writers' workshop (and workshop in general) then it just makes sense that it became this perfect.\n\nLet's talk about fear. Someone once said, \"Fear is the killer of the mind.\" Imagine what pesticide is to pests, that is what fear is: a killer. But I think a little of it is healthy. It makes one humble, which makes one listen.\n\nI remember feeling afraid that my roommate would be an accomplished writer who would talk about his works vis a vis asking me what I am writing about. I was afraid I have nothing to answer and I would be judged because of this. But lo and behold, the universe gave me Ryan—humble, measured in how he talks, shares only what is helpful, and ever supportive.\n\nI was also afraid that the moderator assigned to me would lead the \"pangangatay\" of my work, would make me shiver by his own presence, and I would learn nothing other than how irrelevant I am as a writer. But the universe gave me my katukayo—VIncenz Serrano, this sublime (?) presence was the opposite of what I imagined. He never brushed away my questions. He answered all of them. He treated me as a colleague, which makes a lot of sense because we're only the one's working on walking in the Philippines. And he is one of the most intelligent and articulate human beings I've ever been around. I am not intimidated but intellectually stimulated and challenged. I want to take walking seriously because of him but he also reminded me that the walking identity is just one identity and I don't have to be too attached to it.\n\nAnd of course, I was afraid that I would botch my presentation and the workshop off my work will be a bloody festival. I've never been so wrong in my life. Panelists and fellows held my work with care but also gave me what I needed to hear honestly. I learned a lot without being hurt, without feeling like I am lesser. In fact, I felt and was treated as an equal.",

    "content": "\nIf I don't have to work on a project during the writing block of the uninterrupted morning block of [[My daily routine]], I jump right into the core of my creative practice: writing inside [[thoughts/forest garden of the mind]].\n\nI do my writing in the morning to take the most advantage of the clarity and focus and usually have after a good sleep.\n\nThere are several types of [[Seeds]] and [[Seedlings]] in my forest garden, but I prioritize developing [[templates/essay]] and [[thoughts/poems]]. I scout my [[writing inbox]] for any unfinished essay or poem and work on them.\n\nIf I am running out of essays or poems to work on, this means my writing prompts are running out and I need to generate more prompts through the following:\n1. I review and process at least two previous [[Diary]] entries and see if I could generate new prompts from them.\n2. I review and process [[Seeds]] (snippets taken during a walk). I begin with yesterday then move my way backwards.\n3. I review insight notes.\n4. I review literature notes.\n\nThroughout this process, my main goal is to move seeds and seedlings to [[Evergreens]]. Evergreen poems and essays are important so I have something to share in a regular basis. But evergreen thought notes are also important because they determine evergreen essay production and, more importantly, inform my project for [[thoughts/intentional living]]. I strive to process at least one note every day.\n\nBy the end of my session, I push changes in my forest garden to its public version powered by [[thoughts/quartz]] and Github.\n\nAfter this, I read. I attempt to read at least one page from a book or an article each day. If the material is theoretical, I make highlights, which I process into literature notes later ([[how to write literature notes]]).\n\nLastly, I process any photos I may have taken the previous day. Processing involves deleting bad shots.\n\n# References\n\nMatuschak, A. (n.d.). *My morning writing practice*. Andyʼs Working Notes.

    "title": "My poetics",
    "content": "\nI use the word [[poetics]] liberally to refer to a personal, usually unique, way of creating art.\n\nMy poetics, i.e., how I understand and approach creativity, heavily relies on how I see the world ([[thoughts/my worldview]]) and [[thoughts/my quest]] (also informed by my worldview).\n\nFor now, I would describe my poetics based on:\n1. How I want to feel + what I want to achieve during and after creation\n2. What I want others to achieve and feel after experiencing my creation\n3. How my process will achieve the two above\n\n# Summary\n\nI want my creative processes to enrich my existence and my creative works to enrich the existence of my audience. I achieve this by keeping a rejuvenating daily creative routine and focusing on perfecting my craft of creating essays, poems, photographs, and books that help my audience continuously appreciate the universe and their life.\n\n# What I want to feel + achieve\n\n## Elevate personal experiences\n\nI want my creation process and products to elevate my experiences. Since two of my most important strengths are [[Appreciation of beauty and excellence]] and [[Continued freshness of appreciation]], I believe that my work is to appreciate life and the universe. I want to focus on the eternities. I want to be near nature and beauty as much as possible and highlight them. I want to curate what I tell the world on just these things. I want to document a life about these things and share that to others. (Source: Diary entry from [[2023-01-18]])\n\n## Cultivate understanding and wisdom\n\nI want my creative acts to cultivate [[thoughts/understanding]] of the world as it really is. I want them to nurture a deep friendship with [[thoughts/wisdom]], a friendship that helps me understand reality, uncover truth, and use it to act appropriately at each moment. Throughout this process, I am hoping to build a personal philosophy of living that is as honest as it is meaningful to me.\n\nI want to use this personal philosophy of living to inform [[thoughts/living]] itself. I want to act on what I am learning as much as possible. From applying my worldview in real life, I then collect feedback that I can use to iterate on it. My goal is that by living my wisdom, I live a life filled with meaning and happiness.\n\n## Witness effect of my works\n\nI want to see the effects of my work to other people's lives as often as possible. I know that writing tends to be a long-term process, and the effects of my work are not immediate. I accept this. But whenever there is an opportunity for me to see how my work affects others, I want to see and experience that in person as often as possible.\n\nI want my creative process to help me feel peace of mind, love, wisdom, intellectual and emotional growth, ginhawa, and freedom. I don't need my work to provide me fame or the feeling of doing important work.\n\n## Enjoy community\n\nI want to be surrounded with people who support the life I want to live. I want to have mentors, peers, and an audience. I want to have an intimate circle of support. I want to have a philosophical group. I want to have a writing group. I want to be part of a scenius that both challenges me to expand my horizons and grounds me to the ultimate vision: **a friendship with wisdom to live a happy and meaningful life**.\n\n## Feel sustainability of my work\n\nI want to be able to support myself while pursuing this life work with a source of income that provides enough money, feels good and ideally closer to joy, and does not rob me of the time I need for the core of my life work. I am open to starting a business based on my art, designed in such a way that does not compromise it. However, my ideal sustenance model is the [[Patronage model]].\n\n# What I want my audience to feel + achieve\n\nI have done some work defining:\n- [[My ideal audience persona]]\n- [[thoughts/my audience and community]]\n- [[thoughts/my ideal mentors and peers]]\n\nAll of these are people I want my work to have an effect on.\n\nAt present, I think the field I will best thrive is the arts, specifically creative writing ([[A life in letters]]). Although, I am not completely ruling out philosophy, specifically [[thoughts/lyrical philosophy]].\n\nBeing Filipino, my audience will primarily be Filipino. But I still want to converse with an international audience because walking, philosophy, and most other subjects I'm interested in are universal topics.\n\n## Feeling existential\n\n[[thoughts/i want my audience to feel existential]]. Existentialism ultimately results to a feeling of happiness and meaningfulness grounded in [[Truth]].\n\nI want my creative work to help people appreciate their life and the universe continuously.\n- I want my creative products to make people feel that their life and experiences are elevated, deep, valuable.\n- Whatever I learn from understanding and living my philosophy, I share it to the world primarily through artifacts that could serve as archetypes and models for anyone who is called to live a life of philosophical contemplation or those who just want to enhance their well-being and their life's meaningfulness.\n\n# My process\n\n## My subject matter\n\nI write about my thoughts and experiences. Specifically, I write about my life stories, studies, and walks.\n\nI want to write about living intentionally, finding what is true, looking and curating beauty, and striving to be kind and compassionate.\n\n## My media\n\nMy main medium is writing. The form I want most to master is the personal narrative essay. In my essays, I want to intersperse philosophy, personal life, culture, history, place, and walking. I like my personal essays to contain the following:\n- philosophical inquiries\n- landscape descriptions\n- poems\n- quotations\n- translations\n- photos\n- research\n- general narratives and stories\n\nNevertheless, I also want to deepen my love and mastery of poetry.\n\nMy second medium is photography.\n\n## My creative artifacts\n\nSee: [[thoughts/my creative artifacts]]\n\n## My style\n\nI want my work to execute the following:\n1. Framework: Move between these three realms: cosmic–local–personal (ala [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]]).\n2. Inventiveness and poetry (ala [[Annie Dillard]])\n3. Simplicity of language (ala [[Ben Hewitt]] and [[contacts/rofel brion]])\n4. Walking vignettes and photographs (ala [[thoughts/craig mod]])\n5. Have a surface-level element that it was written outdoors through the dance of mind and body moving.\n\n## My method\n\nI collect materials primarily through walking. My goal with walking are as follows:\n1. To walk as much of the Philippines as I can.\n2. To take photos and videos while walking.\n3. To write about my walks.\n4. To publish creative essays (text + photos/images) in a website that will become the most comprehensive collection of information on walking in the Philippines.\n5. To send intimate newsletters to readers.\n6. To create books out of the above creative artifacts.\n7. To establish a sustenance model that helps me continue doing the above.\n\n[[Why I walk]]\n\n## My workflow\n\nSee: [[thoughts/my workflow]]. This is also very related to [[thoughts/publishing frequency]].\n\n## My sustainability model \n\nRight now, I use the [[thoughts/day job model]] to sustain my work. But I am hoping to transition into a [[Patronage model]]. See [[thoughts/my sustainability model]].\n\nHowever, the patronage model is difficult to pull off at this stage. So here are [[thoughts/business ideas adjacent to my interests]].\n\n## Elements\n\nI write in multiple languages, namely Pangasinan, Filipino, English, (possibly Sign Language in the future). I want to make these languages talk to each other and make the most of each without nurturing the animosity each has to each other.\n\nMy work has some pastoral elements in it. My calling, my gift, is to remind people and to call them towards their state of depth. In a way, I am a pastor of free religion—a religion that starts within me first. One of the things I want to do is eventually help people one on one—a life of retreat and communion, of going back to my well but going out to help others. I want to build a purely naturalistic belief system then from there, get out and have an adventure into the wilderness of compassion.\n\n## Principles\n\n### Inner first\n\nMy creative life is an extension of my life. The main reason why I create is because I want to understand the world and live well. My life is my most important artwork. Therefore, my creative life begins within. I am my first audience. Whatever creative work I do in private is my most important work. I believe that creation is first an act of renewal. This inner work is the most fundamental part of creative life. I could do away with all the other but not this.\n\nThis is why the most important parts of [[My daily routine]] are those that involve [[thoughts/meditation]], [[thoughts/contemplation]], [[thoughts/walking]], and [[thoughts/journaling is sacred|journaling]]. When I am busy with sustenance work, I could let go of other projects except these.\n\n(Note: Connect here discussion in [[Understanding and living are the core of my life work]])\n\n### Macro then micro\n\nMy photos shall be philosophical. Capture an abstract concept from macrocosm then use a moment, a subject, an object to represent that.\n\nSame with writing. Macrocosmic concept but use a vignette to represent it. My writing work should combine cosmic, local, and personal perspectives in one, moving from one to the other in a dance.\n\nThis is a style I borrowed from [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]].\n\n### Only give birth to something as it arise\n\nOnly write something when it is worth saying. You don't have to force anything.\n\n### Incorporate strengths\n\nI try to articulate my purpose. Right now, my **purpose** is to achieve self-actualization and eventually transcend. To do this, I am dedicated to **understanding the truth about reality** (people and nature). I do this by cultivating a rich intellectual life, which involves daily studying (journaling, reading, Talahardin, philosophical walks). Through this intellectual life, I allow myself to change course and explore whenever I want to (**curiosity**) or dive deep into a specific subject (**love of learning**). The ultimate goal of such an intellectual life is to build wisdom and **perspective** on things. I share this perspective through the blog and through conversations whenever they are available.\n\nAlongside this intellectual work is a different but related practice, which could also facilitate and enrich my intellectual tasks: I cultivate **appreciation of beauty and excellence**  and their **continued freshness**—the small things as well as the big ones. This practice is mainly facilitated by walking and what I do when walking (savoring the environment, photography, and taking notes). This intentional exposure to beauty and excellence generates gratitude.\n\n### Facilitative\n\nWhenever I am ready, I want to work on applying my ideas to individuals on a more personal, intimate, and practical level through [[Facilitating]].\n\n### Emotional and intellectual\n\nI want my work to feel both emotional and intellectual.\n\n[[My life work is both emotional and intellectual]]. The intellectual work involves [[thoughts/reading]], [[thoughts/writing]], and thinking (i.e., [[thoughts/philosophy]], which is also my main craft). The emotional work involves [[thoughts/walking]], [[thoughts/poetry]], and [[Photography]], which provides a rest to intellectual work or facilitates and even guides the former.\n\n### Process over product\n\n[[thoughts/process over product]]\n\nWhat I want to do with walking\n\n---\n\nI used to subscribe to [[contacts/rem tanauan]]'s [[thoughts/ginhawa poetics]], but I already find it limiting, although I think I still believe on some of its unarticulated tenets.\n\nToday, I subscribe to the following beliefs about the act of creation:\n1. Creativity should be a vehicle to maximize complete freedom. I subscribe to what [[thoughts/ann lauterbach]] said: \"Poetry protects language from serving any master.\"\n2. Creativity, because it involves action, is saying, \"I choose to live this life which I didn't choose for myself, which was gifted to me, and which I could easily abandon by killing myself.\" Therefore, creativity if befriending life, embracing it, an effort to see what good can be taken from it.\n3. Creativity, is therefore, a way to create meaning in what is a meaningless world.\n\nSeeing life through this metaphor makes [[thoughts/walking]] relevant and writing walking excursions appropriate.\n\n# To do\n\n1.

It was also inspired by an initial reading of [[thoughts/the inward morning by bugbee|The Inward Morning by Bugbee]]and Thoreau's purpose written in [[thoughts/walden by thoreau|Walden]]:\n\n\u003e\"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.

    "title": "My quest",
    "content": "\n## Metaphor\n\nI am an existent who ultimately doesn't know where he came from. I came to a space that is foreign. I didn't choose to be here. This space can be tough. There is one way out: death. And yet I chose to live. In this space, I take a walk slowly to understand where I am and try to live with curiosity. First, I do it only to survive, but I realize I am capable of more than that. I walk to learn the geography because I can attend to other existents who occupy the same space. I can attend in some way that I create happiness and meaning, things that are not innately in the space, things that only I, the being with the mind, could provide. The space is meaningless and I have the capacity to bring meaning to it. It is as if I was chosen to do this very work.\n\n## Explanation\n\nMy quest is articulated here as fiction, but really is a metaphor. It is made up of two things:\n1. An articulation of my picture of reality (i.e., [[thoughts/metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]])\n2. An articulation of how I respond to this reality (i.e., [[ethics]], [[praxeology]], and [[poetics]])\n\nIn short, my quest is heavily inspired by [[thoughts/my worldview]]. Since my worldview could grow and change in time, so will my quest.\n\nThe beliefs about reality within my worldview that is most relevant to my quest are as follows:\n1. [[We did not choose to exist]].\n2. [[thoughts/life is inherently meaningless]].\n3. [[thoughts/meaningful living is possible despite meaninglessness]].\n4. Believing on a God can be convenient, but [[God does not exist]].\n5. Since God does not exist and [[There is no single purpose everyone must follow]], I am left to DIY how to live.\n\nThe beliefs about responding to reality within my worldview most relevant to my quest are as follows:\n1. The formula for living is simply this: [[To live well simply means to set your own intentions and live according to them]].\n2. [[To live intentionally requires adequate self-knowledge]].\n3. [[To fulfill one's intentions, one needs to have adequate knowledge about the world]].\n4. When transitioning from unintentional to [Intentional living]], you need to know enough about what you want and how you are going to get what you want. The former requires self-knowledge. The latter requires knowledge about the world.\n5. A part of my DIY how to live project is ensuring that I am free of pain and happy as much as possible ([[thoughts/happiness]]).\n6. But then, I realize that [[Happiness is not the ultimate value]], and that I also need [[thoughts/meaning]].\n7. These arguments led me to a simple articulation of my purpose: \"[[thoughts/my purpose is to live deliberately]].\"\n\nMy worldview and quest defines [[thoughts/my poetics]].\n\n## To do\n- Perhaps connect here all the metaphors you mentioned in [[_index]]\n\n# References\n\nSeybold, E. (1951). _Thoreau: The Quest and the Classics_. Yale University Press.\n\u003eI was prompted to write think about my quest after reading a portion of this book.\n\nThis note heavily relied on another note: [[2022-07-12 seeds]].",

I build wealth through an ideal job and save for financial independence.\n\nEntrepreneurship is not very attractive to me right now because it requires an amount of focus and attention that robs me of the time and energy I need to dedicate to what I want to do: insight-generation. Entrepreneurship can work if I perform the duties of an owner rather than a hands-on startup founder.\n\nRight now, I am using the [[thoughts/day job model]] to sustain my research activities. I could use my day job to pivot to [[Financial independence]], which frees me up to pursue insight-generation without the need to grow profit.\n\nA middle way from the Day Job model to financial independence is the [[Patronage model]], which attracts me. [[A patronage model is best for an independent researcher]] mainly because it helps the researcher focus on his main goal: to produce insights and test them through prototypes, not really to earn profit.\n\nHowever, since I don’t have enough career capital, I need to bootstrap my audience. I need to pursue [[Sharing]] and [[Connecting]] to build and cultivate relationships first that I can convert into patrons in the future.\n\nI need to be ready with the possibility that no one will support my research financially, because it is too niche or its value is not easily seen, or it is too “selfish.” And this is why maintaining a day job and improving my financial life is so important for me.\n\n***\nNow\n- Part-time work\n- Keeps expenses low\n- Saves and invests\n- Builds ideal life and career intentionally and freely\n- Retire by age 55 to 65.\n\nOption 1\n- Part-time work\n- Keep expenses low\n- Saves and invests\n- Builds income streams not related to passion to increase income\n- Build ideal life and career\n- Retire early\n\nOption 2\n- Part-time work\n- Keep expenses low\n- Saves and invests\n- Builds a career that also provides money\n- Retire early\n\nOption 3\n- Sames\n- Build an income stream tangentially related to your passion\n",

My main goal for studying was not to acquire a broad knowledge of the field but enough knowledge to answer a question that I feel like I was asking my whole life: “How should I live?” I believe that [[thoughts/philosophize to live deliberately]].\n\nThere are so many angles to answering this question. However, I think I have come to a very useful and really basic truth, which helped me see through the question more clearly. And that truth is this:\n\n[[Life is almost all about subjective experiences]].\n\nI’m tempted to say, “Life is ALL about subjective experiences,” but I feel like this undermines the importance of the little objective truths that we are capable of accessing.\n\n# Metaphysics\n\nThe subject of [[thoughts/metaphysics]] is at the core of any philosophical inquiry. Religious or spiritual inquiries are also philosophical so they can never escape metaphysical questions.\n\nObviously, there are lots and lots of metaphysical theories. But all of them try to answer a single question: “What exists?”\n\nI am persuaded with the following conclusions:\n\n- [[an external objective physical world exists]].\n- [[The external physical world is made up of countless individual units of matter]].\n- Apart from these countless individual units of matter, [[Minds exists]].\n- [[Minds make sense of the external objective physical world]].\n- [[Minds are unique to each human being]]. Therefore, [[thoughts/subjective experiences are unique to each human being]].\n- [[The interaction between the external objective physical world and the mind creates subjective experience]]. This interaction is explained by the [[Indirect interaction theory per Patterson]] of minds.\n\nMetaphysics is a difficult topic to navigate because [[We agree about what we want and disagree about metaphysics and epistemology]]. This is why [[The Buddha avoided metaphysics]]. But [[Metaphysics and epistemology can help us be kinder]].\n\nOthers\n- [[God does not exist]].\n- [[There is no single purpose everyone must follow]].\n\n# Epistemology\n\n- [[Foundations necessarily exist and are inescapable]]\n- [[Focus on foundations, not conclusions]]\n- [[It is impossible to arrive to true conclusions using flawed foundations]]\n- [[The longer a worldview goes unexamined, the more difficult it becomes to revise]]\n- [[Discard a worldview with a mistaken foundation]]\n\n# Ethics\n\n- [[We act based on practical rationality]]\n- [[thoughts/life is inherently meaningless]].\n- [[thoughts/meaningful living is possible despite meaninglessness]].\n\n# Economics\n\n",

(Get two answers)\n- Some historical or scientific trivia about walking\n- Some uses of walking: health, mental health, connect with others, connect with the physical world, a platform for creativity (writing, photography, poetry), activism\n- My personal relationship with walking: I love walking because when I perform it, it hits multiple goals that are important to me: health, mental health, nature, I solve issues with my partner when walking, I enjoy walking with friends. Ideas and poems come to me when walking. I am able to practice photography. I feel embedded in a community of strangers that share a similar space. I befriend a specific place (rewalking space makes me familiar with it). I love the high I get from discovering a new path.\n\nIntroduce the workshop\n- The goal of the workshop is to experience the variety of \n\nPhase 1: Kapwa\n- Paglalakad na may kasama, usap, pakiramdaman\n\nPhase 2: Pook\n- katahimikan\n- gaze the surrounding\n- stop and focus on one aspect of the terrain, ideally something you haven't notices from it in the past and get to know that feature better\n\nPhase 3: Sarili\n- katahimikan pa rin\n- Iiwanan ko na kayo mag-isa\n- Babalik tayo sa may puno pagkatapos ng ilang minuto\n\nPhase 4: Bahaginan\n- kung sino lang gustong magbahagi\n- Mga natanto\n- Mga iuuwi sa Ili\n\n***\nOther thoughts\n\nAng paglalakad ay sintomas\n- ng mahabang pagkakakulong sa loob ng bahay\n- ng pagnanais na guminhawa o gumaling mula sa nararamdamang sakit sa katawan\n- ng hindi pagkakakilala sa sarili\n\nIf we are too many, divide the group into 2, and ask a co-facilitator to watch over the other group.\n\nEmbrace the unplanned occurences. We have a plan but we could adjust depending on what happens in the road.\n\nMag-alay ng tula at lyrical philosophy sa bawat yugto ng lakad\n\nBaka hahayaan silang magsalita basta bawasan at ituon ang pansin sa lugar mismo.

You must choose to pursue it actively every day.\n\nHow can you see the future?\n\n- The actions you take now are shaping your future.\n- Look at the past six months of your life.\n- If you repeat those last six months, are you happy with where you’ll be?\n- If not, something needs to change.\n- What’s going to change?\n- How are you going to become that disciplined, driven version of yourself if you don’t make a commitment today?\n- What action are you going to take today to become the person you want to be?\n\nThe only person who can truly stop you is you.\n\nTo be determined is to be single-minded.\n\nClarity must come first before discipline.\n\n- Discipline is critical but effective only when applied to a single pursuit in service of a well-defined goal.\n- First, get clarity about what you want. Then use discipline to pursue it.\n\nWhere is your greatness hiding?\n\n- What is something you do when, after what feels like a few minutes, you look at the clock and find four hours have passed?\n- What are you most passionate about?\n- What makes you come alive?\n- What fulfills you?\n\nWe’re all good at many things. But successful people chose to dedicate themselves to greatness in one area.\n\nIf you want greatness, your automatic response must be “No.”\n\n- Dedication means saying “No” to pursuing all other things.\n- You can do it all, but you cannot do it all well.\n- There are a few things in life you can do—a few choices you can make—that will lead to the life you want to have, and then there’s everything else.\n\nREVIEW QUESTIONS\n\n- Why do you need to actively pursue your dream every day?\n- How can you see the future?\n- Who is the only person who can stop you?\n- Why should you focus on just one thing?\n- Why should clarity come first before discipline?\n- Why is it important to learn how to say “No”?\n- Why is it important to see the words “Yes” and “No” as directional and not emotional?\n\n# 3 - Audit Your Passion\n\nIf you want to find your passion, find what you love doing, not what you love thinking about doing.\n\nThere’s a great difference between being passionate about the act of doing something and being passionate about the idea of doing something.\n\nYou cannot know whether or not you’re passionate about something until you’ve faced and overcome resistance.\n\nIf you have not done it, if you have not encountered resistance, if you have not continued until you’ve overcome resistance, you are not passionate about that “passion.”\n\nYou have to narrow down the over-inflated list of passions in your mind. Examine that list and systematically remove the imposters.\n\nGive yourself permission to enter into an exploratory phase. If you haven’t spent time doing something that you think you might be passionate about, permit yourself to try it. Allocate time to the act of doing it.\n\nHow to try out a passion\n\n- Pick one thing.\n- For the next several weeks, set aside time each day to practice, learn, and do.\n- Make mistakes.\n- As much as possible, immerse yourself in that world.\n- Take the idea of the thing you had in your mind and audit it. Try it and see if you like the act of doing it. Put yourself in the position of experiencing what it’s like to do that thing. Get a good idea of the process and what your day would look like if that thing became your full-time pursuit.\n- Persist until the novelty wears off.\n- If you’re truly passionate, you’ll press on. If not, you’ll quit.\n\nThe way you respond when things aren’t easy is the determining factor.\n\nStrategies to look for your passion.\n\n- What are two categories of interest to you? Look for what falls into both categories. The common area between your two general interests may be a sweet spot.\n- What have you enjoyed doing in the past? What have you done that you’re really fond of? What did you enjoy as a kid? What was it about that thing that enticed you? Why did you like it? What parts of it did you enjoy most?\n- What would you do even if you weren’t paid to do it? This can be a great indicator of passion. Removing the money aspect can provide clarity as to what you might be passionate about.\n\nThe things you’re good at might be where your passion is.\n\n- Start with skill.\n- Ask people you know to tell you what they think you’re good at.\n\nStart with something that makes money and become passionate about it is easier than starting with passion and figuring out a way to make money from it.\n\nThe greatest indicator of a sustainable passion is something you’re good at.\n\nYou may not always see this ability in yourself though. That’s why it’s important to ask your friends or family about what they think you’re good at.\n\nIf you’re not good at something, it will be hard to enjoy the act of doing it. It’s hard to enjoy doing something poorly. This is the reason why it’s great to start with what you’re already good at now. You can start with something you’re not yet good at, but know that it will require significant discipline and patience to apply yourself until your skill develops.\n\nWhat you choose to pursue now doesn’t have to be what you do for the rest of your life. In fact, it almost certainly won’t be. It’s a stepping stone.\n\nIt doesn’t matter which option you choose. Pick one and start. Indecision is the enemy. Picking the “wrong” thing is not what’s holding you back; it’s your lack of decisiveness.\n\nThere’s no direct path to success. It will take time to discover what gives you fulfillment. What you’ll end up enjoying the most in life is likely several steps removed from you right now. Remember that. The only thing keeping you from getting there is doing the next imperfect thing.\n\nThe only thing standing in your way is choosing and doing the next three things—even if they’re the “wrong” ones. The next thing you pick is almost certainly not going to be the thing you do for the rest of your life. You might think of that as the wrong thing, but you often have to go through seasons of picking the “wrong” thing several times in order to end up at the right thing.\n\nHow exploring helps you\n\n- You will learn skills with each pursuit.\n- You will discover what you don’t like to do.\n- You will gradually get closer to discovering what you truly love to do.\n- You will have experiences that you take with you and apply later in ways you can’t anticipate.\n\nThe more you try to feel like you have all of your stuff together before you choose to take action and move forward, the longer you’ll be stuck.\n\nREVIEW QUESTIONS\n\n- According to Sean, what is one reason why it’s difficult to choose what you want to pursue?\n- How can you really tell that you are truly passionate about something?\n- What should you do with your list of passions?\n- What are some strategies that you can use to look for your passion?\n- What is the greatest indicator of a sustainable passion?\n- Why should you ask your friends and family about what they think you’re good at?\n- Why should you start with something that you are good at?\n- Why is picking the wrong thing better than indecisiveness?\n- Why is exploring not a waste of time?\n\nNEXT ACTIONS\n\n- Narrow down your list of passions.\n- Decide which passion to nurture.\n\n# 4 - Set a Big Goal\n\n[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=6\u0026q=16.057022,120.453816)\n\nIf you can have anything you want, then:\n\n- What is your perfect life?\n- What is the life you want to have?\n- What is your health like?\n- Where are you living?\n- What does your ideal day look like?\n- How much money are you making?\n- What are your goals?\n\nTake a moment to create a new note.\n\nWrite today’s date at the top.\n\nThen write a list of all the goals you have.\n\nIf you’re going to dream, dream big.\n\nWhere you’re at now is a result of the goals you’ve set prior to this day and the steps you’ve taken to achieve them.\n\nIf you’re not where you want to be, look at what you were doing several years ago to see why.\n\nWhere you’ll be in five years is a result of the goals you set now and the steps you take to achieve them.\n\n“Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.”\n\nWe underestimate what we can accomplish because we think in limited units and linear growth.

Desperation results to compromise.\n\nHow do you prevent yourself from getting into a scarcity mindset?\n\n- You have to create financial padding for yourself.\n- Unless you already have a significant amount of money set aside, the only way to avoid getting desperate and falling into scarcity is to get a day job that covers 100 percent of your bills.\n- The day job is a functional piece to the puzzle. It is your foundation.\n\nYour day job needs to be in a different industry from your passion.\n\n- When you have a day job in the same industry as your passion, you run the risk of killing the passion.\n- Unless you can control every aspect of your day job (which clients you work for, the process, the hours, and the projects you take on), you will find yourself in situations where you’re forced to do things in a way you don’t want to do them.\n- If you spend the same kind of energy at your day job, you become more invested, even though the freedom is not there.\n- The day job is the wrong environment for organically growing your passion.\n\nHow can you know that you day job is in an entirely different industry?\n\n- if you come home from your day job bursting at the seams with energy for pursuing what you’re passionate about, that’s the right day job.\n\nGolden Handcuffs\n\n- Financial benefits intended to encourage highly compensated individuals to remain with a company.\n- Underscored if you’ve increased your cost of living to match your high pay.\n\nIf you hate your day job, you need to quit.\n\nWhat Your Day Job Should Be\n\nWhat Your Day Job Shouldn’t Be\n\n- Should pay your bills and cover 100 percent of your expenses.\n- Should support the exploration and pursuit of your passion.\n- Should allow you to grow your passion organically without compromise.\n- Should help you wait until you get your passion to the point where you can make a living from it.\n- Should be something you don’t hate.\n- Not your favorite things.\n- Should not drain your energy.\n- Should not drain your creativity.\n- Should not be in the same industry as your passion.\n- Shouldn’t be the place where you partially indulge your passion in compromised conditions.\n\nMake the commitment now to find the right day job and refuse to stop until you do.

However, we can get so caught up with this game that we forget a more fundamental reason why we want to know what is true—to live our own definition of a good life.\n\nThe idea is that by being sharp in knowing what is true via [[thoughts/metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]], we can understand better the terrain of life and ourselves, which in turn helps us take better [[thoughts/action]]s (see [[Practical application is the ultimate test of knowledge]]).\n\nFor example, although, [[The Buddha avoided metaphysics]] because, according to him, it prevents us from being kind to each other (because [[We agree about what we want and disagree about metaphysics and epistemology]]), [[Amoralism]] demonstrates that [[Metaphysics and epistemology can help us be kinder]]. So, if our definition of a good life is a kind life, to [[See things as they really are]] through metaphysics and epistemology can help us get there.\n\n# Related\n\n- [[Suffering is avoided by seeing things as they are]]\n\n",

They use it as a micro-blogging platform where people are reminded that they exist. Another way of solving the problem of people forgetting them is to [[thoughts/work with the garage door up]]. Andy does this with his working notes.\n\nPerhaps, pop-up newsletters also fall into this category.\n\nPros: No pressure to produce work, avoid sharing half-baked ideas.\nCons: People can forget you if you don’t compensate with microblogging.\n\nExamples: [[Roman Krznaric]], [[Andy Matuschak]], [[Ben Hewitt]], [[Steve Patterson]]\n\n# Roundup weekly updates integral to a weekly review\n\nThese are extremely valuable to the author.

I want to explore sharing when something is worth sharing. I want to focus on doing private research. This means that I will share microblog posts on social media for now.

At the time he told me this, I was pissed off that my interest with botany was taking away time I needed for writing and something I just started exploring:\n\nOnce in history, when writing and paper didn't exist, people kept memories through the spoken word. But the human brain is fallible and our ancestors knew this. They knew they needed tools to help them remember. One of these tools was place. For example, among Austrailia's aboriginal people, songs were used to navigate landscapes. The songs, which were narratives, were remembered by walking on the land and the land is navigated through memories within the songs (cf. The Songlines by Bruce Chatwin).\n\nWith the arrival of writing and printing, the use of place as mnemonic device has declined. We can easily capture memories through photos, audo recordings, and notes. However, this does not mean that memory's reliance on matter (landspace, objects, scents, etc.) ceases.\n\nMost often than not, the answer we are searching for lies not in walking new paths but in re-walking old ones. This means that when we are old enough, what we seek is often found through relearning.\n",

But my personal experience suggests that there are things I experience but couldn't articulate and there are things I do without bargaining or analysis.\n\nFor example, I can't analyze myself to loving someone or feeling in awe and amazed and moved by something, such as a sunset. The strongest emotions that convince us we want to stay a bit longer are not usually the product of analysis. Think if you may. You cannot escape it. But never ever over do it.

    "content": "\nSuicide is the greatest subject of writing. One, there is the responsibility involved in writing about the topic. Studies show that suicide rates increase whenever media covers suicide. It is as if whenever we talk about it, we endanger someone else's life. Then there's the mystery of it all. Those who took their own lives won't be able to tell us what happened at the last moment before they went.\n\nWhen I was young, on one of the preaching walks, the woman we were talking with told us about a recent suicide in their community. I judged the person who committed it. Why would someone ever do such a thing? To hurt himself. People who do that commit the most unforgivable sin.\n\nYou won't understand suicide until you are there. Until it is the only thing that makes sense. That your brain is in so much pain that you cannot take it any longer and it is the only way out. It is all about pain. The way I experienced it. I know some people had the time to philosophize about it. My experience was that I was just really desperate of whatever physical thing I caught. Because it was physical.\n\nBut what that experience taught me was not giving up. Or giving up but not giving in. It is ok to accept defeat to let go. But I gave myself the chance to be patient. And patience was everything. Waiting was everything.\n\nThe waiting, I discovered from experience, happened easily when one does it day by day. Moment by moment. The by-product of this is that you appreciate the slowness of life and what happens in between. This was when I got another realization: [[thoughts/life is inherently meaningless|life is inherently meaningless]]. The reason why it can be so easy to give in is because we haven't done the work of creating meaning (either through building relationships, touching people's lives, seeing the world, reading, etc.), it is so difficult to find a reason to keep going when in that situation. I was deep in religion but not even my beliefs saved me. And this is why I think, a lot of young people who caught depression, easily give up. They just haven't been in this world long enough to see closer and longer for [[thoughts/meaning|meaning]]. [[thoughts/there is no destiny|There is no destiny]]. Meaning is not given. We look for it ourselves. It takes some work to create a meaningful life even among those who grew up in the healthiest families and in the most privileged situations.\n\nSuicide is the single most important motivation. We want to find the good in life as much as we can to never ever want to let it go. And if ever this resolved is challenged, we know we are stronger.\n\nFor those who have never experience the urge to harm themselves, be grateful for it, but never ever judged those who do. And while you're life is perfect, make the most of your situation by finding meaning as much as you can so that you are ready whenever things go south. Because they always do.",

I try to understand to develop wisdom, feel good, and always act appropriately.\n\nThere are two works involved in understanding:\n\n1. **Sharpening my understanding.** This involves cultivating [[Mindfulness]], comprehensive research, deep reading, careful thinking, and mental sharpness, so that I can [[See things as they really are]] (i.e., apply a [[Scout mindset]]).\n2. **Using my understanding.** This involves applying my understanding in various situations and subjects.\n\nThe main question I try to study is: [[thoughts/how should I live?]]\n\nA concise answer to this question is my purpose: [[thoughts/my purpose is to live deliberately]].\n\nSince [[Life is a project]] made up of individual actions, answering the question “How should I live?” involves understanding what [[thoughts/action]] is. To understand what action is, I also need to understand the context where it is initially intended (the [[mind]]) and the context where it is manifested (the physical universe).\n\nOnce I understand action, I can move on to studying a more specific way of acting or living: [[thoughts/intentional living]]. Intentional living is how I fulfill my purpose. Through intentional living, I can align my actions with my purpose, which are informed by an understanding of my [[True self]].\n\nI can achieve this alignment by following [[The core process of intentional living]], which requires three levels of understanding:\n\n1. An understanding of my true self\n2. An understanding of how I can identify and set my intentions\n3. An understanding of how I can act in alignment with my intentions\n\nThese levels of understanding are all jump-off points to other intellectual disciplines and other practices.\n\nIn the Philippines, these three levels are usually explored in academic psychology circles, Eastern spirituality circles, and Christian circles. However, [[There is a need for a non-academic and non-sectarian discourse in intentional living]].\n\nI study a lot of different subjects and here is my studying process: [[Talahardin cycle]].\n\nTo do\n\n- Make a separate note on the three levels of understanding.",

And the reason we are still talking about [Thoreau's] _Walden_ 150 years later is as much for the personal story as the pastoral one: a single human being, wrestling mightily with himself, trying to figure out how best to live during his brief time on earth, and, not least of all, a human being who has the nerve, talent, and raw ambition to put that wrestling match on display on the printed page.

    "title": "Walking as historiography",
    "content": "\nIf walking can be use to write stories, essays, and poems, why not histories, especially those yet to be written?\n\nWeird but it seems that Los Baños doesn't have a dedicated history book much less a book just about Los Baños in general. I went to the UPLB library once and asked a librarian for books on LB's local history, and what he gave me were books on the raid of the the Los Baños internment camp. I asked a friend who teaches history at UPLB and he told me LB's history is \"touched\" in UPLB's history book. Then he sent me links on lectures about the history of Grove.\n\nBut really? No dedicated book? No one has ever dared to write a book about this place's story? Its spirit?\n\nI am highly skeptical and my research may not have been thorough enough. But if there is a book, shouldn't I have seen it by now?\n\nOur disassociation to landscape, to place, baffles me.\n\nThere is this glitch in Google maps, a small stretch of road near the UPLB main library, which Google names \"Narra.\" When you walk along that road and you care to look up, you'll see that the tin sign says Domingo M. Lantican Ave.\n\nBut then I took a walk last night, as it has always been, up to the College of Forestry, and there on the intersection of Lantican and Makiling Street, in front the gate of Forest Products Research and Development Institute, I saw a short stone sign, which I may have noticed before but didn't care. It says \"Narra.\" And I remembered that Makiling Street had the same stone sign and it just occurred to me while I am writing this that I saw a similar sign in another street, Drilon, the concrete road built along a vibrant stream of the Molawin river, which me and my friends affectionately call \"batis.\" The sign I couldn't remember but it was a name of a tree.\n\nAnd a narrative formed in my head. The names in stone signs were the old names of these streets and the glitch in Google Maps may have been caused by someone who entered a dated data: the old name of Lantican. So a wide renaming happened. The streets of old in UPLB used to have simpler names, names of trees. The new ones are names of supposedly important people.\n\nAnd I understood this without reading a history book. I understood that between now and a long time ago, something happened. And nobody needs to tell me. Nobody needs to talk. I do not need a book. I just need to walk, to look, and then I'll understand. Then perhaps I could tell the story.\n\nThis is the old way of creating stories. Our ancestors looked around them and created narratives.",

Rebecca argues that the Western walking literature is basically a sausage party that fetishizes rural walking with nature as object. And then she introduces alternative forms of walking, which are less motivated by a desire to romanticize nature and which women have also participated in. One of these forms is urban walking, a \"messier\" way to walk but one that was not bound to the moralizing tendencies of nature and rural walks.\n\n## References\n\nSolnit, R.

These studies are intellectual footprints, not blueprints.\"\n\n\u003e\"Sa paglalakbay na ito, wala akong layunin. Ang mga pag-aaral na ito ay mga bakas hindi balangkas.\"\n\n— Herbert Fingarette\n\nCome in, come in, a fellow traveler of the web. You must be tired from all your virtual walks. Please bring your shoes in. I don’t mind. And sit here beside me. Would you like some brewed coffee? Or perhaps some sweet _ternate_ tea?\n\nWelcome, welcome, and thank you for coming by. It is an honor to have you here even for a few minutes—a privilege to host you on my little space on the web. Please come and take your rest.\n\nI am Vince, and this little abode of ours is _**The Long Walk**_, a new newsletter I hope to welcome you to every Sunday from now. Since it is probably our first time to meet (or we have met long ago and forgotten each other’s stories), please allow me some introduction.\n\n## My Long Walk So Far\n\nI wrote a longer piece of my story on my **[website](https://vinceimbat.com/about/)**, so I won’t bore you with the details here. But to provide some context, here’s a brief timeline of my long walk so far.\n\n- **1992–2011:** I grew up in a small town in Pangasinan, Philippines. Raised by Jehovah’s Witnesses, I had a pretty religious upbringing. I didn’t fully embrace the faith of my parents, though, until I got into college when I became the youngest pastor (they call it “ministerial servant”) in our congregation at the age of 18. A month after I turned 19, I went through a debilitating depressive episode. I left school, went back home, and licked my wounds.\n- **2012–2014:** The depression crushed my entire identity and belief system. I left my childhood religion and returned to school to finish my degree. I became an atheist.\n- **2015–2016:** While I identified as an atheist, I never fully embraced that identity. I discovered blogging and encountered a writer who made me realize that I still resonated with what most people describe as “spiritual.” I started exploring Eastern philosophy (read the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali!) and attended New Age gatherings. I still didn’t believe in “God,” but I knew I had “spiritual” sensibilities.\n- **2017–present:** I discovered philosophy. I dropped the New Age stuff but kept the Eastern philosophical ideas. Never wanting to go back to school, I taught myself the basics. I was first obsessed with metaphysics (what exists) and epistemology (how we know what we know), but later realized I was more interested in answering the question, “How should I live?” Around the same time, I discovered poetry, photography, and the power of walking. Plus, I was able to keep daily journaling, reading, and studying routines. So I thought, why not combine everything into a single lifelong learning project? And so, _**The Long Walk**_ was born.\n\n## A Note on Format\n\nFor now, this newsletter’s structure shall follow the rhythms of a walk. A walk leaves footprints and makes trails. Those who follow the walk must find the first footprint and begin there until the destination is reached. The tracks left allow us to “reenact” the walk. Interestingly, this is precisely what a poem or a narrative does. In a reading companion to a collection of his essays and poems, Thomas Gardner has this to say about narrative and poetry:\n\n\u003eWallace Stevens, in “Of Modern Poetry” (1940), defines a poem as “the mind in the act of finding / What will suffice.” This seems to me to be true of any work organized lyrically: poems, certain sorts of essays, certain sorts of fiction. We see in such work a mind moving—noting and considering, listening to what it has just said, leaping forward or turning back. Rather than reporting on what will suffice, speaking from a position of arrival, this kind of writing dramatizes the act of getting there. What we do when we read such work, as Kenneth Burke illustrates …, is reenact that movement. We perform the poem, connecting image to image or turn to turn, making of its various parts a coherent inner action: “For a poem is an act, the symbolic act of the poet who made it—an act of such a nature that, in surviving as a structure or an affect, it enables us as readers to re-enact it.”\n\u003e\n\u003eA poem, we might say, gives us instructions for re-enacting its inner movements.\n\nAnd so, through this newsletter, I will attempt to lay down the trails of my mind—some of the things I read, saw, heard, felt, or thought about in a week. I present them here as footprints, therefore, in chronological order.\n\nSince this newsletter comes out every Sunday, the chronology happens from Monday to Saturday. I do not impose a pre-existing structure on the piece. I let the structure emerge as I look back to the week. This structure hunting happens on the day the newsletter comes out: Sunday. If the structure appears, I will be grateful. If it does not, I surrender to what is given to me. As often happens in a real walk, we cannot control what we see or find. We can only control where we put our attention into. If the essay does not look well-organized, please remember that this was by design. The goal of the newsletter is to leave footprints, not blueprints.\n\nThe purpose of _**The Long Walk**_ is to invite you, dear fellow traveler, to take a peek into an intellectual and contemplative life outside the academe or a formal religious institution. But I also ask you to engage and start a conversation—you can do so in public via the comments section or in private by responding through email.\n\nSince this is our first walk together, a preamble is necessary, making this first issue longer than I intend to be its usual length. I promise I won’t keep you this long in our next walks together.\n\nWith all that out of the way, please, I invite you to stand up and join me outside. Let us go under the trees and the warm rays of the sun for a little stroll down the trails of the previous week’s walk.\n\n## The Long Walk: October 3 to 8, 2022\n\n### October 3, Monday\n\nWhile exploring Substack, the platform where you are currently reading _**The Long Walk**_, I subscribed to a few other newsletters. I read one entitled _**[Weary and Sated With Seeing: Lucretius and Us](https://tolma.substack.com/p/weary-and-sated-with-seeing)**_. The central thesis of the piece is that our minds are attracted to what is new rather than what truly matters. Here’s my favorite quote from the article:\n\n\u003eNo one prides themselves on knowing that the sky appears blue, but we do pride ourselves on more exotic types of knowledge.\n\n### October 4, Tuesday\n\n![Re-reading Steal Like an Artist](/tlw/images/001/steal-like-an-artist.jpg)\n\nI reread _**Steal Like an Artist**_ by Austin Kleon while writing notes in my journal by hand. I came to this quote at the end, which got me thinking:\n\n\u003e\"What makes us interesting isn't just what we've experienced, but also what we haven't experienced.\"\n\nI looked for an example from my life, and one thing came to mind. Growing up, I didn’t have the experience of living in a house where people asked each other what they were doing. All of us were silent types, and we did our own thing in the privacy of our rooms. What this did to me was I flourished on my own. I didn’t need much validation. Almost everything I did then (even now) was for the intrinsic reward I get from it.\n\nIn the evening, I listened to Sam Harris’ interview with the poet David Whyte on the **[Making Sense podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53g4sNZ40XI)**. In the interview, Sam alluded to the assumption that meditation requires silence or the absence of words or thoughts. We both agree that it doesn’t. It is impossible to be conscious and without thoughts at the same time. As long as you are aware, you produce thoughts. Meditation is not silence or nonthinking. _**Meditation is simply a careful discipline of paying attention.**_ We can do it both in silence or in the middle of a conversation, for one’s object of meditation can be anything.\n\n### October 5, Wednesday\n\nI did a morning walk with my partner, which I now find more regenerative than the late afternoon to early evening walks that I typically do. Now that students are back in Los Baños, the university has been filled with people in the afternoon, and my afternoon walks are beginning to lose their magic. I need to do more morning walks.\n\nWhile walking, I asked my partner about that quote from _**Steal Like an Artist**_, which I mentioned above. From listening to her thoughts, I came to a new conclusion: _**We are hindered by our lack of experiences, and yet, like any disability, we can turn this incapacitation into something that makes us unique.**_\n\nBack home, I sat down to ask myself, “How does one start living a philosophical and contemplative life?” This is a question I wanted to introduce early in this newsletter and the reason why I reread _**Steal Like an Artist**_ in the first place. Kleon’s answer to art can also be adopted in philosophy: You don’t have to recreate the wheel. Thousands of ordinary people like you have attempted the same feat. Look for their examples and steal from them.\n\nI wanted to look for heroes—mentors, alive or dead—and learn from them one by one as much as I could. I needed to create a philosophical genealogy. I began my search for heroes by returning to a kind of philosophy I encountered a few months ago: Lyric philosophy.\n\nI read _**[Introduction: What is Lyric Philosophy?](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/593935)**_ by Warren Heiti, which talks about Jan Zwicky’s seminal book, _**Lyric Philosophy**_. I learned about the interesting design of Zwicky’s book, which she seemed to have replicated in at least one of her subsequent books. I also learned that “lyric philosophy” is a more accepted term with a decent amount of following in the academe compared to Edward Mooney’s “lyrical philosophy.” That said, both scholars find inspiration from the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\n![My philosophical genealogy](/tlw/images/001/my-philosophical-genealogy.png \"My philosophical family tree so far\")\n\n### October 6, Thursday\n\nJan Zwicky is part of my philosophical genealogy, but should I start my studies with her? I was not sure. I felt like she spent most of her work talking about form rather than answering the central question I wanted to contemplate: “How should I live?”\n\nI decided to start with someone else first: Edward Mooney. I began by reading his blog, _**[Mists on the Rivers](https://edmooneyblog.wordpress.com/)**_. In his blog, Ed mentions his heroes—Thoreau, Wittgenstein, Kierkegaard, and Bashō. Thoreau was already in my family tree. I happily added the others. Ed also pointed me to two other blogs worth studying: _**[Distinctly Praise the Years](https://catlinlowe.wordpress.com/)**_ and _**[Quantum Est In Rebus Inane](https://kellydeanjolley.com/),**_ which in English means, “How much trivial stuff there is in the world!”\n\nIn the evening, I dedicated a walk to a friend who died in a terrible vehicular accident a few years back. She once studied at UPLB and, for sure, walked some of the places I frequent on campus. A poem honoring her came to me while crossing the never-ending bridge of lore. You can read that **[poem on the website](https://vinceimbat.com/Never-ending-A-poem-for-Gyra/).**\n\n### October 7, Friday\n\nIn my journal, I alluded to how translation facilitates understanding by forcing us to read something slowly. Although I love Thoreau, I find _**Walden**_, especially its first chapter, difficult to swallow. That changed when I decided to start translating it into Filipino. The translation process forces you to look at each sentence and word as closely as possible. Only then can you understand what you are reading and internalize it better because it is in your language. It doesn’t work all the time, but it will work for most of us.\n\nBack on Edward Mooney’s blog, I read _**[Sympathy with Intelligence](https://edmooneyblog.wordpress.com/2012/05/09/sympathy-with-intelligence/)**_, which touched me deeply. He writes so well that I started reading his latest book _**Living Philosophy in Kierkegaard, Melville, and Others**_.\n\nOctober 8, Saturday\n\nAs we often do on the weekends, my partner and I walked from our house to the School of Forestry at UPLB, a length which is enough to cover in about 45 minutes of leisurely walking. We do it in the morning right after we wake up. Upon arrival, we usually look for an empty cottage under the big trees and start meditating. This time, we tried something different. We looked for a single prompt, which each of us used to journal for one to three pages worth of writing. The prompt that came to us was the verb “articulating.” We read our essays to each other after. You can read **[mine on the website](https://vinceimbat.com/On-articulating/)**.\n\n---\nThis ends our walk for this week. Thank you for joining me, and I hope to see you again next Sunday!\n\n## References\n\nI cultivate a forest garden of the mind, which I call my collection of notes from almost a decade of reading, writing, and contemplation.

Welcome, welcome!\n\nIf you are reading this newsletter for the first time, I encourage you to check **[[TLW 1 - A Philosophical Family Tree|the inaugural issue]]**. That issue sets the stage for this second issue and all future issues, providing a brief introduction to my life and an explanation of the rationale behind this newsletter's format.\n\nIf reading another issue on top of this is a big choir (it is!), here's the shorter version:\n\nI am Vince Imbat, an ex-young pastor turn philosophy aficionado who loves to walk. This newsletter is _**The Long Walk**_, a weekly missive that shares artifacts I find in my walks—in geographic space and in what I call \"the forest garden of my mind.\" The newsletter mimics the rhythm of a walk, chronologically featuring \"footprints\" I leave throughout my studies and contemplations from Monday to Saturday. These footprints serve as archetypes for anyone in their own independent philosophical and contemplative journey.\n\nFor many of you, this is our second week walking together. The outdoors is waiting. There is a lot to cover. So wear your best footwear and bring some water. Let us begin to follow the footprints of the previous week's walk.\n\n## The Long Walk: October 10 to 15, 2022\n\n### October 10, Monday\n\nHave I told you about [[thoughts/henry bugbee]]? Oh, you must know about Henry Bugbee. We both share a love of [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]], and among all the candidates for being Thoreau's heir, I think he is the closest, at least in terms of resonance. [[Annie Dillard]] could be the closest modern Thoreau in terms of writing style (she's the only one I've read who could really pull it off!). But Bugbee's life is closer to Thoreau, and for me, that is more important.\n\nBugbee, like Thoreau, was committed to a philosophical-spiritual life. He is a \"professional philosopher\" trained in the academe (unlike Thoreau, who was largely self-taught). And yet he saw philosophy like Thoreau did. To him, philosophy was not an impersonal discipline preoccupied with arguments and opinions. He saw philosophy as an exploration of his life in the context of other lives and sentient beings in nature.\n\nLiving philosophically to him took prior importance over professional success, and because of that, he was denied tenure at Harvard. His philosophical life rejected the publish-or-perish aphorism of the academe. He refused to write strictly academic essays and was never interested in treating his writing like a conveyor belt, a model that most of his peers followed. In fact, this is an area where he clearly surpassed Thoreau. If Thoreau published very little (just two books and a few works published posthumously), Bugbee almost published nothing. His only book was ***[[thoughts/the inward morning by bugbee|The Inward Morning]]***, a relatively obscure book that presents Bugbee's philosophical thoughts in journal form. What did he do when he was not writing? Well, living, of course.\n\nFor the past two months or so, I have been reading _**The Inward Morning**_ intermittently, writing my summary with a few commentaries for each entry. _**The Inward Morning**_ is not the easiest book to read and so I tried my best to translate Bugbee's thoughts in a more palatable form in my commentaries.\n\nIn his entry, dated September 27, 1952 (the entry I read on this day), Bugbee meditated on the role of faith in philosophical reflection. Here is a sample of my commentary on this entry:\n\n\u003e*In this entry, Henry Bugbee directly responds to [[Gabriel Marcel]]. He returns to the subject of [[Faith]]. He begins by stating that faith (i.e., openness or trustingness) is as important in ethical reflection as in action. Philosophical truth, he claims, arrives to the present from the past via reflection. But this arrival requires faith on the possibility of realization because philosophical truth, the meaning of one's past experiences, comes involuntarily like insight ([[Insight cannot be predetermined]]). We do not control its arrival artificially. We can only wait and trust (i.e., have faith) that it will arrive.*\n\n[[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-09-27|Read the entire entry here]].\n\n### October 11, Tuesday\n\nI continued reading _**The Inward Morning**_. In his entry written on September 28, 1952, Bugbee presented a critique of the statement \"believe in order to understand.\" He says that this statement invites dishonesty as it presupposes that we can believe in something we do not understand. He seems to suggest that belief cannot be used to achieve something (i.e., understanding). If anything, belief or faith is a place where we arrive, not a vehicle we use to arrive at something. After understanding everything and noticing that our knowledge can only get us to a point, we call upon faith. Faith is surrendering to mystery.\n\nThis entry is the most difficult to understand among all the entries I’ve read so far and I won't be surprised if my interpretation was wrong. Also, I honestly felt a little uncomfortable reading about faith among other of Bugbee's choice of topics. Faith is a topic I have avoided ever since leaving my childhood religion and contemplating it brings up difficult memories. That said, as I grow into my philosophical walk, I see that there are philosophical questions we will never truly answer and an important task of anyone who is called to nurture a friendship with wisdom is to acknowledge this the soonest. Such humility will save one from heartache and will guide one into finding the mysteries that truly exist. I think faith is inevitable.\n\nIn the evening, I walked among the large palm trees at UPLB. I wrote these words on my digital note-taking app:\n\n\u003e*I fancy these large trees. When I see them together like standing giants. I feel in awe. Astounded. Like silent watchers of the paths.*\n\n### October 12, Wednesday\n\nHoping to establish some continuity in my days, I persevered into reading _**The Inward Morning**_. Bugbee's September 29 entry was about what is essential to a person's life. He mentioned in a previous entry that the realization of what is essential to us comes unexpectedly, usually in the middle of our normal routines. What is essential to one human, therefore, is subjective, as it may not be what is essential to another.\n\nHere lies a problem: how is sympathy possible in a world where people have different and often conflicting essentials? Bugbee says that our ability to know what is essential to us also means we have the ability to perceive what is essential to others. This opens the door to sympathy. He further claims that a universal need—the need to commune with others—is enough to establish the foundation for fellow feeling.\n\nThe rest of his entry is a thought-provoking meditation on the relationship between the individual and the collective, one of my favorite philosophical problems. Here's a quote from Bugbee himself:\n\n\u003e*Perhaps we are only truly individual in so far as we are able to acknowledge and act upon a universal significance in our lives which is the very opposite of divisive in its import for our relations with other persons.*\n\nThis reminds me of [[Scott Barry Kaufman]]’s insight in his book ***[[Transcend — Kaufman]]***: We self-actualize so that we eventually transcend, a state where we forget ourselves and our communion with the interconnectedness of everything and everyone takes center stage.\n\nIn the afternoon, I re-read my past nature journal entries, entries I wrote when I tried emulating Thoreau's writing routine. His routine went this way:\n\n1.  He took long walks in the afternoon, possibly right after lunch until early evening (sometimes later). He wrote brief notes about what he noticed around him while he walked.\n2.  The following morning, he would go back to his notes and expand them into journal entries.\n3.  He repeated this from 1850 until he died in 1861 (a total of 11 years).\n\nI was only able to sustain this routine for a couple of weeks. I was not my hero, but it was a great experiment, and reading those entries now makes me realize I actually enjoyed those days a lot. Expanding the entries was difficult, yes, but the method really elevates the quality of the day and aids a lot in reflection. I go back and reread those entries now and I see each day as clearly as when I experienced them. With that clarity comes the opportunity to extract some useful truth from them.\n\nHere are two of my best entries:\n- [[2020-10-08 seeds]]\n- [[2020-10-10 seeds]]\n- [[2020-10-15 seeds]]\n- [[2020-10-18 seeds]]\n- [[2020-10-19 seeds]]\n\nInspired by reading my past nature journal entries, I tried writing brief notes of observations during my walk that evening: [[2022-10-12 seeds]].\n\n### October 13, Thursday\n\nCurious to see if I could improve the quality of my walks, I decided to try a morning walk for a change. I left the house at around 7:30, which, I discovered, provides one of the best lights you will ever catch in Los Baños, so I took a few photos while on the walk, something I haven't done for a while.\n\n![Broken stove](/tlw/images/002/broken-stove.jpg)\n\n![Service entrance gate](/tlw/images/002/service-entrance-gate.jpg)\n\nI stopped on a bench for a while to enjoy the cold breeze that blew from behind me. After a few minutes, I continued walking until I reached the Fertility Tree at Freedom Park (the featured photo for this newsletter). Under the tree, I journaled about how this morning's walk made me feel at home in Los Baños again. I wrote that perhaps it is not a change of location that I need but a change of routine. I also continued reading _**The Inward Morning**_ and wrote my commentary on Bugbee's October 2, 1952, entry. In this entry, Bugbee talks about Socrates and how the power of his thought lies not in his induction but in the ability of his inquiry to return us to ourselves. Bugbee also commented on Socrates’ idea of the examined life and its value. You can read my entire commentary on **[the website](https://vinceimbat.com/The-Inward-Morning-Commentary-1952-10-02)**.\n\nAs if I needed more walking, my partner and I walked in the evening, under a bright moon after the new stray cat we adopted was spayed. We sat on one of the benches at Freedom Park. What ensued was her sharing of a podcast show she was currently listening to about a couple who left Christianity. This is my partner's current process, which is something I went through in 2012 (more than a decade now!). Listening to her made me realize how much trauma we could carry just by being brought up in a religious household. A question revisited me: Is the parent's role to mold the child to be who she wants him to be or to support the child to become who he wants to be?\n\n### October 14, Friday\n\nIn the previous issue, I shared that I am currently reading the book ***[[thoughts/living philosophy by edward mooney|Living Philosphy in Kierkegaard, Melville, and Others]]*** by [[thoughts/edward mooney]]. Mooney is a student of Henry Bugbee, and I am currently reading him as the focal point from where I shall trace my philosophical family tree.\n\nThe book is a delightful collection of essays, relatively short in length, poetically delivered, and yet philosophical in the subject. I love this word Mooney uses—living philosophy. Here's how he defines it:\n\n\u003e“Living Philosophy” in my title has a double sense. We have philosophy that’s conveyed as a dramatic living narrative. And second, we have a spectrum of persons who in various ways are living out their philosophies.\n\nI am realizing these days that, while I think analytic philosophy is extremely important and necessary, my talents fit a brand of philosophy that is closer to the arts than the sciiences. A living philosophy—this is what I am intent in studying more about.\n\n### October 15, Saturday\n\nThis entire day, I did a mind walk on the life and works of the poet [[contacts/rofel brion]].\n\nIn the Philippines, poetry that _feels good_, the kind that primarily speaks to that speechless, inarticulate part of us, is very rare. It has almost no advocates in the academe, and that is why we are so lucky to have someone alive and still kicking to serve as a beacon of this way of writing poetry who is as embedded in the academe as he is outside.\n\nI knew Rofel Brion through my friend who first discovered his book at a book fair and who has since talked to him via Zoom. I connected to Rofel through Facebook and luckily got an invite for the launch of his new book of vignettes called _Saglit: Alaala’t Muni_, which happened today.\n\nTo prepare for the launch, I re-listened to his **[podcast interview with Kevin Chan](https://www.kevinnchan.com/2020/11/24/radio-ep-8-rofel-brion/)**. If you have a single link to click in this newsletter (and you also write poetry), this should be it. Rofel's philosophy of \"not taking your writing seriously\" is a refreshing and much-needed perspective in a world that valorizes creative production. It frees me as it resonates well with the things I am learning about writing from Bugbee and Thoreau.\n\nTo experiment with a Rofelian style of poetry (what he calls \"mala-haiku\" or \"haiku-like\"), I wrote a poem, which I translated into Filipino. A friend, GP Roperos, then translated it into Spanish. Here is the poem in three languages:\n\n_RESTS\n\n*I long for the moments\nwhen you\nsprawl beside me\nand I\nstroke the white fur\nof your belly\nas you\npurr in delight.*\n\n*MGA PAHINGA*\n\n*Inaasam ko ang mga sandaling\nhumihilata ka\nsa tabi ko\nat hinahaplos ko\nang puting balahibo\nng tiyan mo\nhabang\nhumuhuni ka sa galak.*\n\n*DESCANSOS*\n\n*Siempre deseo\nque te acuestes\nal lado de mi\ny tocaria el pelo blanco\nde tu vientre\nmientras ronronearias\ncon gran deleite.*\n\n![Stroking Champy the cat's belly](/tlw/images/002/champy-belly.jpg)\n\nI went home that night, with Rofel’s new book in my bag and a handful of new seeds of thoughts to write about in the following days.\n\nHere is a distinguished poet whose main audience, after himself, was his family, friends, and people he has touched in his life. Rofel writes about and for people whose faces he knows and whose names he can recall. (Listen to **[the podcast interview](https://www.kevinnchan.com/2020/11/24/radio-ep-8-rofel-brion/)** I beg you, and discover a new way of doing art.)\n\nI went home that night—and I remembered you, you who are reading this newsletter right now. All of you. Some, I know by name. Some, I know their faces. But about half are still faceless strangers. I asked myself, what can we do to change that?\n\nWell, of course, to ask you to introduce yourself.\n\n## Before You Go\n\nI want to know your name, where you are from, and what you do these days. What philosophical or contemplative interests do you have? Please reply to this email or comment on the public post. And if there is anything that resonated with you from this week’s walk—or any feedback—please don’t hesitate to share them. I will read and respond to everything. I am happy you are here.",

    "content": "\n![Two boats at the beach](/tlw/images/003/two-boats-beach.jpg)\n\n\u003e*a hole inside me*  \n\u003e*gapes open wide, expanding*  \n\u003e*smarting to be filled*  \n\u003e*by something I have yet to find*  \n\n~ Rofel Brion\n\nI'm [Vince Imbat](https://vinceimbat.com/) and this is [The Long Walk](https://vinceimbat.substack.com/).\n\nHere is the past week's walk.\n\n## The Long Walk: October 17 to 22, 2022\n\n### October 17, Monday\n\nIn the morning, I decided to do my journaling and reading outdoors. My partner, Lea, agreed to come along. The sun was scorching hot when we left the house. But as we reached Freedom Park, the sky started to grow dark. Here goes Los Baños' bipolar weather.\n\nThe grass was wet throughout the park and under the Fertility Tree, so we decided to sit on one of the benches surrounding the Carillon tower.\n\nWe'd already done some writing when we heard it. A loud meowing from afar started to grow louder.\n\nThen everything happened so fast.\n\nAnts started biting my feet. They crawled on Lea's sandals. We stood up and started walking away, unsure where to go next. But then we saw it, the source of the peculiarly loud meowing—a grown kitten following a male student intermittently looking behind at the noisy creature, appearing slightly surprised that it had chosen him as a target.\n\nI want to look at it, Lea said, so we approached the kitten. Lea took it and peeked at its genitals. It's a girl! She carried it on her bosom.\n\nWe named it Carillon (after a week-long debate).\n\nAnd we did remember **[Keeley](https://vinceimbat.com/All-other-things-thrown/)**.\n\n![Little Carillon cat](/tlw/images/003/Carillon.jpg)\n\nBack at home, while still on my yoga mat, I started reading the foreword to Rofel Brion’s book _**Kapag Natagpuan Kita = Once I Find You**_, a collection of his Filipino poems with their corresponding English translations. The English translations were originally Rofel’s, but he had his friend Noelle de Jesus edit them. Noelle’s translation process inspired me to try translating Rofel’s poem _Umaga (Morning)_ into Pangasinan. My translation isn’t done, but I discovered a **[downloadable Pangasinan–English dictionary](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv9hvsfz)** along the way. My mother tongue, Pangasinan, is a dying language in the Philippines. I’ve been having a lot of difficulty finding a Pangasinan dictionary, so this one, although aged, was a big find for me.\n\nOn my computer, I reviewed a note I wrote a while back entitled **[“Our invisible Walden.”](https://vinceimbat.com/Our-invisible-Walden/)** In the note, I wrote:\n\n\u003e_We have the same questions to answer—they are inescapable: How should I live? Where do I get instructions for living? How do I understand the world?_\n\u003e\n\u003e_Today, many of us don't have the luxury of living for two years in a cabin in the woods. But like Thoreau, we can't escape the questions. Its all a matter of \"when\" do we start getting serious about them. \"When\" do we face our invisible Waldens to build our invisible cabins and start thinking about the questions seriously. When do we say \"Enough. I am answering the questions myself.”_\n\nWhile washing the dishes in the evening, I listened to a **[podcast episode](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016x2jp)** about the **[analytic and continental divide in philosophy](https://archive.nytimes.com/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/bridging-the-analytic-continental-divide/)**. As I am slowly building **[my philosophical family tree](https://vinceimbat.substack.com/p/a-philosophical-family-tree)**, this is an issue I could not escape. The analytic–continental divide refers to a widespread assumption that there are two general traditions in philosophy: one that emphasizes clarity (analytic) and one that doesn’t (continental).\n\n### October 18, Tuesday\n\nI reviewed my highlights from the foreword of _**Kapag Natagpuan Kita = Once I Find You**_. In general, the foreword was an illuminating account of how a “translation by collaboration” could happen. I reflected on how Noelle de Jesus quickly acknowledged that she was not a poet and, in her words, a “learned speaker or writer of Tagalog or Filipino.” Instead of feeling less qualified to do the job of editing Rofel’s translations because of her “inadequacies,” she embraced them and had them guide her on choosing the approach she used to deliver the project.\n\n\u003e _Literalness. I took refuge in the literal. Not being a poet, interesting or otherwise, that was the kind of translation I sought, a word-for-word version that was correct in meaning first, poetic in English second, if at all._\n\nThis choice is sometimes shunned by poem translators, many of which are capable poets themselves. But Noelle does not hide who she is. She proclaims the truth to the world and stands by it. From Noelle, I learn honesty, authenticity, and courage to be who we are.\n\nI continued to study the analytic–continental divide in philosophy and am starting to share the conclusion of **[Brian Leiter](https://philosophybites.com/2011/12/brian-leiter-on-the-analyticcontinental-distinction.html)** that the divide is sociological and not intellectual. Moving forward, I intend to practice a form of philosophy that recognizes the value of both analysis and lyric, a practice that merges both clarity and depth, a way of looking at the world that is interested in both objective and subjective truth. In other words, a holistic worldview.\n\n### October 19, Wednesday\n\nWith Lea, I traveled to my home province of Pangasinan to see my family and stay by the beach for a couple of days. Dickinson’s poem from last week’s newsletter and Rofel’s poem _Umaga (Morning)_ strengthened my resolve to see the sea before October ends.\n\nHere is Emily, once more…\n\n_Exultation is the going  \nOf an inland soul to sea,  \nPast the houses — past the headlands —  \nInto deep eternity —  \n\nand Rofel (with Noelle’s edits, of course)…\n\n_So early in the morning  \nwaves already crest high,  \ndark skies approach  \nin the distance,  \nover there,  \nin the deep, filled  \nwith a great breadth of creatures  \nwhose colors alone, they say,  \nwill amaze you.  \n\n*So they sally forth,  \nbrave the sea, descend into it,  \nand leave me dumbstruck,  \nwith only my feet wet.*  \n\nThe long bus ride afforded me some time to check substacks. Here are three good ones I am currently exploring:\n\n-   **[Under the Net.](https://ksetiya.substack.com/)** The substack of philosopher Kieran Setiya. He writes general audience books that use philosophy to tackle practical life problems. His new book _Life is Hard_, which just came out this October, discusses navigating personal trauma and injustice in the world through philosophy.\n-   **[Photo Meditations.](https://photomeditation.substack.com/)** A newsletter by George Bothamley that combines photography with poetry and philosophical reflection—something _**The Long Walk**_ also tries to do.\n-   **[Mind OS.](https://binnyva.substack.com/)** A newsletter about personal knowledge management (PKM) and its philosophical and psychological basis. I haven’t read it yet, but since I geek on PKM and the graphs and titles in this newsletter looked interesting enough, I decided to subscribe.\n\nBetween long naps during a five-hour bus ride, I did some reading. I continued _**Living Philosophy**_ by Mooney, and I finished Chapter 5—a chapter about the lyrical philosophy of characters in _**Moby Dick**_.\n\n### October 20, Thursday\n\nAfter waking up, I walked with my father for about an hour at the Matic-matic–Maronong road. The last time we walked together was back in 2011 when I was recovering from depression. He doesn’t know this, but it is that long already. So this morning’s walk was something special.\n\nAfter walking, and while waiting for breakfast, I journaled about yesterday’s reading of _**Living Philosophy**_. For the first time in the book, Ed Mooney presented the possibility of having analytic philosophy and lyrical philosophy coexist in one practice (or even in one piece of writing). This connected with what I am currently learning about the myth of the analytic–continental divide in philosophy. Mooney recognizes that it is possible to have multiple visions in a single work. However, for such coexistence to occur, we need to let go of the dominance of our obsession with “airtight and universal principles” and allow subjective, episodic, and ever-shifting philosophical truth to have an equal footing. The best philosophical texts present an objective account alongside a subjective one. One can be clear and straightforward while also being poetic.\n\nAfter breakfast, Lea and I went to the beach. At the beachfront, we napped and journaled (more). I found a few moments of silence and I was graced by a poem.\n\n_WHAT I HAVE_\n\n*Fences block the sea  \nfrom where I sit*  \n\n*and so I just listen*  \n\n*to the sound  \nof water plunging  \non water*  \n\n*then vanishes  \nforever.*  \n\nThe sky was too cloudy for sunset, so we walked instead, until evening. Finally, I am in deep eternity.\n\n### October 21, Friday\n\nI woke up at 6:30 am and started walking towards the beach. The sun is already up. On the beach, an adult male, possibly in his 60s, was with a little girl, around three or four years old. She was his grandchild, perhaps. His _apo_.\n\nThe child was walking around the man, chasing a few dogs with them. The dogs were free. They seem to know the beach well.\n\n![A grandfather and his grand daughter](/tlw/images/003/lolo-apo-beach.jpg)\n\nI walked towards San Fabian and saw the Cordillera enveloped by a thick gray mist. Below me, tiny transparent crabs, almost invisible to the eye, moved from one hole to another. Beside the holes, large footprints—not of man but dog—pressed on the soft sand, so soft I felt so heavy.\n\n![Dog paw prints](/tlw/images/003/dog-foot-prints.jpg)\n\nOn the sand, near the crabs and the pawprints, I sat for a while, watching the waves and feeling sunlight on my cheeks.\n\nOn my way back, I saw a man dragging his bike towards the water. He looked as if he was ready to plunge the bike on the sea. But he stopped and dragged it along the edges of the beach instead. He did this for about a minute, then he dragged his bike back to the concrete road.\n\nAs I made my way back to the resort, I saw an old man on the side of the road looking far into the horizon.\n\n![A lonely old man on a beach](/tlw/images/003/lonely-man-on-beach.jpg)\n\n### October 22, Saturday\n\nAfter watching Lea ride the bus bound to Manila, I walked back home on my own, about two kilometers of concrete. Along the way, I saw farmers opening up their sacks of _ilik_ (unmilled rice), laying them out on the road to dry. I walked on the edges of the road, avoiding the _ilik._\n\nIn the afternoon, I sat to review highlights I took from the second chapter of _**Living Philosophy**_. I clustered a few interrelated highlights that began to make a coherent thought. I flowed.\n\nFirst, I wrote what I understood was Mooney’s argument:\n\n\u003eMooney claims that a work can have an effect on us, or we can engage with it, without analysis (i.e., despite not knowing about the biography of its creator or its history). In fact, to be truly present with the work, we might need to intentionally let go of analysis. Mooney says \"the mysteries of creation lie on the surface.\" You don't have to get deep to witness them. Mooney seems to suggest that a work of art presents with it a particular \"mystery.\" This is obvious. When we encounter a work of art the first time, we know nothing about it. Mooney says you don't have to search for this mystery, it is evidently there on the surface. And the mystery is not something to be sold, it is something you linger into. Mooney clarifies that letting mystery take over does not mean being ignorant or shutting down questioning. It is giving space to wonder.\n\nIn Zettelkasten parlance, what I wrote was a “literature note.” I reflected on this note and allowed it to trigger thoughts that I remember from past writings—writings that were written from my unique perspective. I wrote:\n\n\u003e A product of creativity possesses an inherent mystery. When faced with one, we don't know what it is. We don't have to look for this mystery. It is evident in the surface. There are two ways of engaging with this mystery: (1) We analyze it and treat it as a problem to solve or (2) we linger with it to see if it could have an unspoken effect on us. The former is an active engagement with the work, while the latter is a passive way of being with a work. If we are moved by it, we won't choose it.\n\u003e \n\u003e When faced with an image, a poem, or a prose, it might be helpful to allow yourself to enjoy it without the pressure to analyze. Analysis is paralyzing and could get in the way of really enjoying or even truly understanding a work. I remember DIY MFA, which mentioned that you need to analyze works of art you want to emulate but not all and not every element. So, when engaging with a work, let yourself be present with it, take note of things that jump to you. Return, but only analyze if truly called for. Otherwise, let the initial resonace suffice.\n\nThis last note is what is called a “permanent note.” But as it is now, it isn’t yet permanent enough. I add it to my writing inbox, where I shall continue developing it whenever I feel like returning to it.\n\nAfter writing, I read the latest newsletter article from George Bothamley’s substack _Photo Meditations_. It was entitled **[“Beginner Mind.”](https://photomeditation.substack.com/p/beginner-mind)**\n\nA few paragraphs jumped to me. This one, in particular, was pretty insightful:\n\n\u003e Imagine having the kind of mind that can contemplate all the stars and heavens above . . . and yet, allowing yourself to slip into this sense of tedium.\n\u003e \n\u003e Or imagine having a heart and soul capable of creating art, music, poetry . . . literally bringing never before ideas and forms to life . . . and yet, spending your days convinced that there is nothing interesting to do, so we better just watch another video, or scroll another social media page.\n\u003e \n\u003e _It’s crazy really._\n\nGeorge proposes a mindset shift to counter this dangerous form of boredom.\n\n\u003e It’s not that we are born to be bored with life - or uninspired by our own soul. Rather, it is that we have just allowed ourselves to be distracted. And if we instead approached every single thing in our experience with a child’s outlook - or, as Zen practitioners call it “The Beginners Mind” . . . I guarantee the entire world around us would immediately transform.\n\u003e \n\u003e This is something I often think about when taking photos - where I’m usually trying to find beauty in the simplest corners of nature, rather than in expansive vistas.\n\nGeorge then provides detailed instructions on how to practice this now.\n\n\u003e So, go find a flower, or a leaf, or any object you so choose - and just imagine this is the very first time you are ever seeing it.\n\u003e \n\u003e The colour. . . the scent . . . the petals - the lines on it’s surface - the touch of it’s body.\n\u003e \n\u003e Put aside everything you have ever learned about it’s name or it’s scientific classification . . . and just observe it as if you are a complete stranger in this world.\n\nJust reading this reminded me of the note I just wrote, which I mentioned above. When being at a presence of anything (or, perhaps, even anyone), experience should come before explanation, and explanation should only be offered when asked or when very necessary.\n\nI read this a few minutes before the golden hour. When the hour arrived, I took my camera and followed the light. I didn’t walk towards my favorite trails. I stayed at home, walked around the yard, and looked for the “simplest corners of nature.” The light did not fail me.\n\n![](/tlw/images/003/tree-shadow.jpg)\n\n![Shadow on tin](/tlw/images/003/tin-man.jpg)\n\n![Leaf shadows](/tlw/images/003/shadows-on-leaves.jpg)\n\n![Sunlight on pen fence](/tlw/images/003/pen-fences.jpg)\n\nThis week’s walk ends here.

This issue of _**The Long Walk**_ presents the footsteps I have taken so far in the valley of grief between remembering Rem and trying to move forward.\n\n## The Long Walk: October 24 to November 5, 2022\n\n### October 24, Monday\n\nIt was difficult to fall asleep after learning about what happened to Rem. But I tried. In the morning, when I woke up, I wrote a very brief journal entry.\n\n\u003e Yesterday, I lost a friend. The only truest, closest, most genuine friend I’ve ever had….\n\u003e \n\u003e I need to go back to the steps we took together. I need to re-walk my dear friend’s life. I am still in shock. Still in denial.\n\nI started re-walking my friend’s life per necessity. His family needed photos, both his best portraits and those with friends and family. I went through my entire photo library, chose the best samples, edited a few, and uploaded the photos to a shared Google drive.\n\nAfter re-walking my friendship with Rem in photos, I took a real walk to let thoughts and memories flow. I came home with a handful of words I still didn’t know where to put.\n\n### October 25, Tuesday\n\nI woke up earlier than usual to catch one of the earliest buses to Cubao. My goal was to arrive at Los Baños in the afternoon and visit Rem’s wake in the evening. The trip took more time than I expected, which made it impossible to go to the wake. During the trip, I killed time by listening to music in between writing more thoughts and memories about Rem.\n\n### October 26, Wednesday\n\nI needed something to read on Rem’s eulogy night. The original piece was a collage of the thoughts and memories that came to me in the past two days since learning about Rem’s death. While raw and real, reading them in public didn’t really feel right. Perhaps it was not their time. I listened to Lea’s advice to write things I would’ve wanted to tell Rem. So I rewrote the entire **[piece](https://vinceimbat.com/Kung-natuloy-sa-pancitan-ang-huling-ala-ala-ko-kay-Rem/)** and did just that.\n\nIn the afternoon, I visited Rem’s wake for the first time and helped hold his first eulogy night. I knew Rem was good with people, but for the first time in my entire six years of friendship with him, I saw how much deep love Rem was able to flow into this world. I didn’t realize how large his network of communities was and how much people are grieving his loss until I saw it through my own eyes. There were lots of tears shed. But there were also laughter and joy that night. We were all still grieving, but at last, we had hope.\n\n![Candle light](/tlw/images/004/Ritual-light.jpg)\n\nSomewhere in my Obsidian vault, I wrote:\n\n\u003e Rem’s leaving has left me with a profound existential crisis I have never felt since my depression in 2011 when I left my childhood religion. That was my first awakening. This might be my second.\n\nFor the first time since 2011, I considered the possibility of doing some “pastoral” work. Inspired by Rem’s ability to connect with each life he has touched on a deep level, I realized I wanted something similar in my life. I was no longer content with publishing a weekly newsletter and calling myself a writer. I wanted to connect with people in flesh and listen to them as I figure out how best I can help. But is there a place for an agnostic like me in that kind of work? I sent a message to a common mentor I shared with Rem. I also read the article “**[Why Would an Agnostic Do Interfaith Work?](https://appliedsentience.com/2015/07/09/2937/)”** and found the beginning of an answer:\n\n\u003e “..do you have to be black in order to see the oppression of African-Americans and fight for racial equality? Or LGTBQ to fight for marriage equality? Why, then, must I be religious in order to see a need for interfaith dialogue?”\n\n### October 28, Friday\n\nI helped hold a second eulogy for Rem on the last night of his wake. We stayed after the eulogy and slept on the chapel’s pew chairs together with his family.\n\n### October 29, Saturday\n\nWe left the chapel early in the morning. We wanted to go home to Los Baños to get more sleep before going back to Batangas for Rem’s internment at 2 pm. We arrived home after about two hours of travel. By 11 am, the electricity was gone. By lunchtime, the wind started to get stronger. By 1 pm, torrential rain was pouring. Lea and I decided not to proceed.\n\nWe wouldn’t have made it, not even with our own car. In the evening, all entry and exit points to the crematoria were flooded as the strongest storm of the year graced Rem’s ashes with its presence.\n\n### October 30, Sunday\n\nNothing can be done on the computer or outdoors, so we made it through the day by writing in our journals, reading, and catching up on sleep. Perhaps, a total retreat from the world and our daily comforts were what we needed at this time.\n\n### October 31, Monday\n\nThis was Rem’s ninth day after death. Tagalogs call it _pasiyam_ (_siyam_ meaning “nine”). But for me, it was my first return to Rem’s house, the house I was privileged to visit several times throughout the span of our almost six years of friendship. Crossing the street towards the gate was hard, walking on the balcony where we stayed for hours on end talking about poetry was harder, but entering his room hit me the most. There, Rem’s books stared at me. But there was no Rem on the bed where we had many loud laughs before going to sleep. What was only there were some petals on an altar built for him.\n\nIn the afternoon, I joined the family walk at a secluded park, which Rem did what might have been his last walk of solitude. There, long and heavy bamboo stems blocked the pathways. We had to duck to pass under them and see the fishponds. This is a beautiful place. I can only wonder what poems may have come to Rem as he walked around here.\n\nThat evening, I walked home alone.\n\n![Consuelo Park ampitheater](/tlw/images/004/Consuelo-Park-ampitheater.jpg)\n\n### November 1, Tuesday\n\nI did a long journaling session while contemplating the things I can do to help Rem’s friends and family and projects I could start (whenever I am ready) to help continue Rem’s vision or integrate them with mine. Two things I have committed to after Rem’s departure are (1) deepening my poetry practice and (2) continuing my friendship with Rem by communing with his public and private writings.\n\n### November 2, Wednesday\n\nI can feel that my days are starting to go back to their old routine. In the morning after meditation, I journaled quickly about what October meant for me and what I plan on doing this November. I then plunged into review mode—finances, goals, etc.\n\nI felt like Lea rewarded me with a hearty dinner, after which, I rewarded myself with an evening walk alone. On the walk, raw words came to me…\n\n_Kakalahati palang ang buwan  \ntulad ng buhay mong  \nhindi pa natapos  \nsa pag-inog._  \n\n…and a few more…  \n\n_Nang makita ko  \nang dagsa ng tao  \nsa lamay mo,  \nnapagtanto kong  \nmaari naman palang  \nmabuhay ng makabuluhan  \nkahit aapatnapung taon lang._  \n\nBack home, we watched a good movie before retiring to bed.\n\n### November 3, Thursday\n\nI felt my philosophical voice return after almost two weeks of retreating into the background. On my digital forest garden, I wrote the following note:\n\n\u003e **Amoralism does not prevent me from feeling strongly against certain behaviors**\n\u003e \n\u003e Just because I am an amoralist doesn't mean that I will have to love the unloveable. Amoralism is a metaphysical stance, which means I am simply believing on a statement about what does or does not exist. In this case, the claim that I am persuaded into is that there are no absolute, objective, and naturally occuring values.\n\u003e \n\u003e This belief does not prevent me from feeling strongly about certain behaviors like abusive and violent behaviors. I don't think I want to be around poeple exhibiting these behaviors and if there is a way for me to prevent them from abusing more, and I am in that capacity, then I should act. I am acting purely out of emotions and practical reasons.\n\u003e \n\u003e My difference from a moralist could simply be that I do not use talk about \"inherent rights\" or morality to achieve my goals. But I could imagine a situation where I feel very strongly about protecting victims or would-be victims from an abuser. Amoralism does not automatically make me good or bad. It doesn't even want to use those words. Amoralism does not automatically make me an advocate for safety and lessening of suffering. But it does help me to see things as they really are and from there, hopefully I can lead to my desired course of action.\n\nIn the middle of a bath, words more refined than yesterday came to me:\n\n_Sumasabay  \nsa daloy ng tubig  \nna ibinubuhos ko  \nsa aking ulo  \nang daloy  \nng mga  \nalala mo._  \n\nIn the evening, while washing the dishes, I finished listening to **[a podcast conversation](http://%28https//open.spotify.com/episode/0BTyuAFYXcpXvOOnHal3aT?si=QxVmnrg2QvSD383QvL-TVQ)** between the Riverside Interfaith Council and the Inland Empire Atheists and Agnostics. The conversation reaffirmed my desire to live in a pluralistic world with no single ideology dominating and where peace is possible despite differences in beliefs. This was a vision I shared with Rem.\n\n### November 4, Friday\n\nI started communing with Rem’s public writings. First, I read the overview of his blog **[Pathfinder’s Commune](https://pathfinderscommune.com/)** then wrote a reflection on it. You can read it by clicking on this title: “[Reflections on the overview of Pathfinders Commune](https://vinceimbat.com/Reflections-on-the-overview-of-Pathfinders-Commune/).” In this piece, I reflected on how Rem combined his earlier desire to be a teacher with his latter desire to be a facilitator.\n\nIn the evening, I met with some friends to share dinner and grieve together.\n\n![Molawin Creek at the Botanical Garden](/tlw/images/004/Molawin-Creek-MBG.jpg)\n\n### November 5, Saturday\n\nWhat better way to cap this two weeks’ worth of re-walking Rem Tanaua than to re-walk him once more? In the morning, Lea and I, together with another close friend accompanied the woman Rem loved the most to re-walk the steps they took together 13 years ago inside the Makiling Botanic Gardens.\n\nHere, along the eco-trail leading toward the dipterocarp trees, Rem started his real communion with Love. To re-walk the trail is to re-walk his masterpiece—a masterpiece, which he shared with his other half. And like any other masterpiece, his footsteps will never be recreated no matter how much anyone tries. We can only emulate but never truly recreate what he did—what they did. We can only watch and witness and remember that once, not a long time ago, someone like us tried—no, did his best—to make the most of his one long meandering walk. To bear witness to this and be part of it is one of the greatest gifts I have ever received.\n\n_Pagbaba sa batis  \nsa may mga bato  \ndi mawari  \nkung tutubi  \no ikaw  \nang inaantay ko._  \n\n![Rem Tanauan portrait](/tlw/images/004/Rem-Tanauan-2.jpg)",

I chose to keep a day job to support my writing so I don’t feel pressured to make money out of it. This week was a working week—a marathon of editing, a communion with the material world, which I found was also a rest from **[grief](https://vinceimbat.substack.com/p/re-walking-rem-tanauan)**. I did walk in the evenings after work. And in those walks, the mind, again, confronts the questions of existence alongside the regrets of an aching heart.\n\nHere is the past week's walk.\n\n## The Long Walk: November 7 to 12, 2022\n\n### November 7, Monday\n\nIn the evening, while I was walking, I contemplated the relevance of our beliefs about what exists (metaphysics) with our desire to belong. I wrote:\n\n\u003e Metaphysics make us feel like we belong, like we don’t have to tolerate or exert effort. It is rest. It is home. We need to get out of our metaphysical comfort zones but we need to return to these spaces to feel home.\n\nThis is the reason why we join churches. In those churches, everyone believes the same things. The trouble of tolerating others’ metaphysical beliefs is lessened if not completely removed. We don’t have to debate. We can rest and focus on what is more important to us: friendships, romance, and the pursuit of a good life.\n\nI look at my current circles and see that none of them really share my metaphysical beliefs. I am not part of any agnostic or atheistic circles even if I am one. Every interaction, therefore, involves stretching my tolerance muscles, getting used to listening, hearing, and sometimes even using the language of others that I don’t necessarily believe in. I think this has served well to increase my compassion and my ability to really empathize. But it can be tiring especially if I don’t have a “metaphysical home” to go back to.\n\n### November 8, Tuesday\n\nI am entertaining the possibility of writing a biography for Rem Tanauan. But this is a long-term project. It ought to be. Archival materials have to be gathered and preserved. Also, there is the issue of emotion. Write the biography this early and you won’t gain the wisdom that only time could reveal. And this wisdom is important because it will tell how much to reveal to the world. Reveal everything and you might hurt people, especially those who loved the person whose story you are writing about. Reveal too little and you risk people deifying a perfect yet dishonest image of the person. The story will be written. But it should be written in its own time.\n\nIn the evening, I sat down on the empty bleachers in front of a softball field, alone in the dark. I looked up and stared at the stars for about 15 minutes.\n\n### November 9, Wednesday\n\nOne of the conversations I wish Rem and I had more was about the uses of I Ching by a secular person. I asked him a few weeks before his death how the I Ching could help an atheist or an agnostic. He said the I Ching is like water. It takes the form of the vessel it pours into, and so the I Ching could be used purely as a philosophical text that could prompt a philosophical conversation.\n\nI remember this conversation and so I dug some more. **[People were asking the same question in Quora.](https://www.quora.com/Taoism-How-can-the-I-Ching-Hexagram-be-utilized-by-a-secular-person)**\n\n### November 10, Thursday\n\nAfter watching **[this clip](https://twitter.com/claytoncubitt/status/1587882993393487872)** by the comedian Bo Burnham, I started questioning again how much of our social media use is preventing us from really hearing our deepest thoughts. For writers, philosophers, poets, and artists, hearing oneself is everything. And so this is an issue that I continue to grapple with. I am sure of one thing: the less I use social media, the more I think and write better. This is because I am able to maintain a deeper focus on a line of thought.\n\n### November 11, Friday\n\nIn my journal, I returned to what I was thinking about last Monday (Nov. 7)—the relationship of our metaphysical beliefs with our desire for belongingness. I developed this journal entry into a note in my forest garden of the mind. Here is the note:\n\n\u003e **We feel belongingness to people we share metaphysical and epistemological beliefs with**\n\u003e \n\u003e The Buddha avoided metaphysics. He said it was unimportant and that it prevented us from being compassionate to each other. Overemphasizing our beliefs in metaphysics and epistemology can definitely make us hateful especially when the two are combined into one ideology. We agree about what we want and disagree about metaphysics and epistemology. But metaphysics and epistemology can help us be kinder. It will always be part of our conversation about how to relate with other people.\n\u003e \n\u003e For example, I want to clarify my metaphysical and epistemological beliefs because I first need to create a place of belonging within myself. I first need to feel at home in my body. I want to feel really safe and autonomous and to protect that safe space as much as I can. And from there, expand my sense of belonging. The challenge is of course compassion—to love people outside that circle of belonging that we are ever so interested in building and preserving.\n\u003e \n\u003e This is the reason why building my worldview through understanding is so important to me and why my immediate environment is so important to me and why I want to be careful and intentional in my relationships.\n\nTo illustrate the note, I drew concentric circles.\n\n![Life circles](/tlw/images/005/life-circles.jpeg)\nThe more I leave the center of the circle (my mind and body), the more I leave my comfort zone—my _ginhawa_. But leaving that comfort zone allows me to grow and create more meaning as it is only within the context of my relationships that I truly flourish. **[Sonja Lyubomirsky](https://sonjalyubomirsky.com/)**, a happiness researcher, agrees:\n\n\u003e Perhaps most critical to improving and maintaining happiness is the ability to connect with other people and to create meaningful connecting moments…\n\nBut how often could I leave that center of comfort and for how long without compromising it?\n\nI continued exploring the website of the Unitarian minister **[Andrew James Brown](http://andrewjbrown.blogspot.com/).** I first checked a new page he added to his site: Free Religion. It was a **[page](http://andrewjbrown.blogspot.com/p/free-religion.html)** introducing Shinichiro Imaoka, the advocate for free religion in Japan. I downloaded two free books: one his only biography and the other a collection of selected writings on free religion. Then I also read his short **[biography](https://biography.yourdictionary.com/shinichiro-imaoka)**.\n\n### November 12, Saturday\n\nIn the morning, I spent another long journaling session—about two hours—continuing the thread of thought that came to me the previous day. I started by simplifying my life areas into six:\n\n1.  Overseeing - creating and maintaining structures for managing life\n2.  Understanding - building your own worldview and philosophy of living and using that knowledge to inform your actions\n3.  Restoring - maintaining and optimizing health\n4.  Connecting - building and maintaining relationships\n5.  Sustaining - providing and managing material and financial resources\n6.  Creating - nurturing mastery and joy in different forms of art\n\nPreviously, I used “Life Work” as a category separate from “Mental Health” or “Physical Health.” But I know now that living my life is itself my life work, so it no longer makes any sense to continue treating it as something separate.\n\nThese life areas act like tags rather than boxes. This means that one project could target multiple areas. For example, a vacation trip to visit relatives can both be an opportunity to rest (restoring) and bond with family (connecting).\n\nThese categorizations are an important part of the contemplation I do about building a **[life management system](https://vinceimbat.com/life-management-system/)** that helps me track my goals, actions, and knowledge, that is, my attempt to practice intentional living.\n\nI contemplated whether there could be a process I could follow to set up and then nurture these different life areas in a manner that feels right. And, of course, there is! I remembered the metaphor of walking, which I have been exploring since before I launched this newsletter, and thought about the concentric circles I drew above. I then mapped out the following process.\n\n1.  Set up your home base (i.e., your own worldview, understanding yourself, setting up boundaries, knowing your preferences, establishing practices, curating your immediate physical space) to make it the safest and most autonomous space you can be in. Your home base consists of your mind, body, and your immediate physical space.\n2.  When you are ready, walk your figurative neighborhood and attempt to build and nurture an inner circle—a circle of trust, a support system of close friends, family, or mentors. Use that inner circle to cultivate mutually beneficial support in your attempts to strengthen each other’s home base.\n3.  When you are ready, extend your walk towards town and start challenging yourself to expand your knowledge about others, to open yourself to surprise and dialogue, and to find opportunities to grow among different but still like-minded or like-hearted people.\n4.  Eventually, when your home base is strong, your inner circle solid, and your outer circle thriving, you may feel the challenge to explore what I call “the wilderness of compassion.” You will walk outside the gates of the town and into an arid, potentially unfriendly wilderness. This is beyond your comfort zone, beyond what you think is possible, but it also provides you with the biggest opportunity to grow, transcend, and explore what might be possible with the human heart. Could you, for instance, love the unloveable? Could you feel comfort alongside someone who is at the opposite end of your comfort zone? These are questions only answered by heeding the call of walking into the wilderness.\n\nThis philosophy of living, creating, and connecting illustrated by the metaphor of walking has some similarities with the metaphor of the well (_balon_) that my late friend, which I miss so much, Rem Tanauan, has developed in his poetry course. Here is a translation of a Filipino reflection I wrote this week about the similarities of the metaphors of walking and the well.\n\n\u003e This morning, I have been on my journal for two hours already. I could feel my voice returning, hearing it, no longer just a whisper. I was contemplating the similarities of Rem’s metaphor of the well and the metaphor of walking, which I am currently exploring. Both are metaphors with wide applications but they are sharp in their similarities as metaphors of how to create and how to live.\n\u003e \n\u003e Integral to Rem’s metaphor of the well is returning to it always. Because everything we share to the world as a human and an artist comes from it. The same goes with the metaphor of walking. One needs to return home after several hours of walking to restore strength, heal, and meditate on the things realized and seen outdoors.\n\u003e \n\u003e These metaphors are anchored in a view that life indeed is difficult but that we can always return to a source that we can coax comfort that we may go back into the world and do what we want to do.\n\u003e \n\u003e Integral in this philosophy and poetics of well-being is not hurrying, slowing down, carefulness, and a deep knowledge of self first before going out and doing.\n\u003e \n\u003e After I journal, I usually read one or two poems. When I opened Rofel Brion’s _Kapag Natagpuan Kita = Once I Find You_, this was the first poem that caught my attention.\n\n![Well by Rofel Brion](/tlw/images/005/well-poem.jpg)",

Knowing what is true is useful because human beings have been thinking for a long, long time that theories abound about how we should live abound to the point where the terrain is very muddled.\n\u003e \n\u003e The question that metaphysics answers (What exists?) and epistemology answers (How do I know what I know?) are like a compass. The answers I get from contemplating them allow me to see the terrain and create a map out of it. When the terrain is mapped, it is easier for me to answer the question that I am most interested in: How must I live?\n\nAfter writing the note, I transferred a draft of a poem I wrote yesterday evening while walking.\n\n_**Naiiyak rin ang sansinukob**\n\n*Malayo pa pala ako  \nsa bukana  \nng daang pinasukan ko.  \nLumalalim na ang gabi  \nat ako'y pagod at gutom na.*  \n\n*Naalala kita  \nat naiiyak ako muli  \nkaya ako'y  \ntumingala sa langit.*  \n\n*Sa aking pagtingala  \nsa langit na itim na itim  \ndagling nahulog ang bulalakaw.*  \n\n*Naiiyak rin ata  \nang sansinukob.*  \n\nIn the afternoon, while on a call with a friend, I heard him utter these most reassuring words: _“Do not feel guilty about your choice not to build community with people you don’t have relationships with. A community is made up, first and foremost, of relationships. When there is no relationship, there is no community.”_\n\n![More Tanay mountains](/tlw/images/006/Tanay-mountains-2.jpg)\n\n### November 15, Tuesday\n\nI consulted the I Ching on a question I asked today, “How do I balance going back to my source and helping others?”\n\nI cast the coins, and Hexagram 46 appeared. In **[Hilary Barrett’s translation](https://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/)**, the reading was as follows:\n\n_Pushing upward, creating success from the source.\nMake use of seeing great people.\nDo not worry.\nSet forth to the south, good fortune._\n\nThe image associated with the hexagram was that of a small measuring ladle. The ladle was a metaphor for performing small, measured actions one step at a time. According to the reading, this was how the many things that could be done at this time would be done. The task also encouraged meeting “great people” and letting go of worry.\n\nI do not believe in divination; therefore, I could not see the I Ching as a tool. But, as I, along with many other creatives and thinkers, will attest, the I Ching is a useful “uncertainty machine” that could prompt our thinking to get out of our habitual mental boxes.\n\nThis reading provided a helpful metaphor for what I could do while navigating my grief and my desire to actively help others at this time. Interestingly, the metaphor coincides with **[the metaphor of walking and the well](https://vinceimbat.substack.com/p/walking-and-the-well)**, which I explored last week. The way to ensure that we can actively do something for others while at the same time being mindful of our own needs is to strengthen our source (our well, mind, body, etc.) and then leave that source to help others incrementally—walking this distance today, returning to our source, then increasing the distance tomorrow. This incremental walking is similar to what the small ladle in Hexagram 46 does.\n\n### November 16, Wednesday\n\nIn the morning, when I woke up, I was welcomed by an unexpected problem.\n\nIt broke my morning routine, evidenced by the fact that I started the day re-reading an **[Aeon article](https://aeon.co/essays/forget-prophecy-the-i-ching-is-an-uncertainty-machine)** I read way back about the I Ching as an uncertainty machine. After reading, I took a long walk on the campus, resting on one of the benches at the park under the shade of trees where I journaled. In my journal, I confronted the new problem. I berated myself and asked, _“Why do I always have to learn my lessons the hard way?”_\n\nWhen I went home, I shared the thought with my partner, and she didn’t like it. She grabbed her phone and had me read one of her favorite newsletter articles. I read the article, and it was about a successful woman who asked herself the same berating question. She noticed that, like me, she always had to go through a tough challenge before she started to change. To stop this cycle, she intended to improve her life as much as she could, but when things started to go south, she would “ask the universe” for two gentle warnings, which she calls “feathers,” before getting a “hard rock”—the disaster. Once those feathers arrived, she promised to respond to either and not wait for the hard rock to come before making adjustments. While I am still unsure how to use it, I find this a good metaphor and an important lesson.\n\n![A jeep at Mt. Kulis](/tlw/images/006/jeep-at-kulis.jpg)\n\n### November 17, Thursday\n\nI started reading the foreword of the book _**[Designing Your Life](https://designingyour.life/the-book/)**_.\n\nIn the evening, Lea and I walked until Viado. She left earlier while I continued walking. The walk was captivating and grounding. It helped me feel that I must go back to my source before making a good decision about the situation.\n\nWhile walking, the idea came to me: What if I facilitate awe and doubt?\n\n### November 18, Friday\n\nI read the first chapter of _**Designing Your Life**_. I made the book’s first exercise, a life design assessment of four life areas: work, health, play, and love. I took the assessment and found that all my areas are half-filled—I have done enough to manage them but not enough to feel fulfilled. Half of the work is left undone.\n\nThe book also introduced the concepts of lifeview and workview. Workview is your philosophy of work. It states what work is for you and what it means to you in general. It defines what good work deserves to be. On the other hand, lifeview is similar to what I would call your life philosophy. It is your idea of what the world is and how it works. The chapter introduced questions one can ask to write a short articulation of one’s workview and lifeview. I am answering the questions slowly.\n\n![Kid playing at Tanay](/tlw/images/006/kid-playing-tanay.jpg)\n\n### November 19, Saturday\n\nToday, Lea and I left town to visit Hogar (or Hermitage and Organic Gardens) at Tanay, Rizal, a mountainous municipality in Southern Luzon, for a group retreat. We arrived along with other participants around 3 pm. After eating, I was instructed to go to my cottage and set my things up before returning for the opening program. I was staying by myself in the farthest cabin where I would be sleeping alone tonight.\n\nThe path towards the cottage was a muddy grass walk with some large plates of stone followed by a long winding flight of stairs. Before reaching my cottage, I passed by another where a friend who was yet to arrive would be staying. When I saw mine, I was pleased. It had a little porch where one could be silent if the indoors became unbearable. However, the indoors proved pleasing for me, who had just arrived. It had a dining table and chairs, a small kitchen, a restroom, and a bed, which could accommodate a single person. The religious stay here for a few days, even months, as part of their formation. Knowing this made my visit inside a bit inspiring.\n\nAfter fixing my things and taking a quick shower, I descended from my hill back to the mess hall. All of us participants were gathered for a few words of welcome. After this, we were led outside to be introduced to the surroundings. We walked a stairwell of soil and rocks that crossed a garden called the Garden of Prayer. To my surprise, the Garden led to my cottage above the hill. I taught some participants and showed them my cottage.\n\nAfter the walk, we gathered back to the mess hall for dinner. Over dinner, I talked with a few participants about the state of education in the country. Two in our group were teachers—one taught in high school, while the other taught at an online university. We all agreed that more schools and teachers need to be given more academic freedom if they are to stir the boat in the right direction. We also decided that young people are being asked too early to commit to a career when they should be exploring as many subjects as possible before making a decision or, better yet, never being discouraged from changing far along the way.\n\nAfter dinner, we all assembled at another building to introduce ourselves formally, listen to some stories, and make some art. It was raining most of the time, but the sky gave us some two-hour clearing, from 9:30 to 11:30 pm, to lie down on the ground and watch the stars. Through the help of an app and the guidance of a trained participant, I saw Mars, Jupiter, Sirius, and the Aquarius constellation.\n\nBy 11 pm, I felt I wanted to be alone and do what I intended for this time—a time for me to think alone in a beautiful geographic space. And so, I said my goodbyes and returned to my cottage while the others were still watching the skies between jokes and stories.\n\nIn my journal that night, I wrote the following words:\n\n\u003e Whether you believe on a God or not, you cannot deny one thing: you did not create yourself. You were put here by someone or something that is way more powerful than you. And this thing is filled with myster. The answers about its nature are not intuitive. They have to be pondered about—sometimes, felt. And this is enough, this awe, to move one to appreciate everything—every moment while one is alive. But this thing is usually lost to us. My calling, my gift, is to remind people, to call them towards this state of depth.\n\u003e \n\u003e My vision is to work with people one on one—a life of retreat and communion, of going back to my well by going out to help others. I plan on constructing a purely naturalistic belief system, my house, then from ther, get out. Where this will lead me, I still don’t know. But I ultimately want to walk into the wilderness of compassion.\n\n![Hermitage cottage](/tlw/images/006/hermitage-cottage-2.jpg)\n\n### November 20, Sunday\n\nI woke up around 6:30 am and immediately started preparing to go out. I was set to walk the trail up to what they said was a cafe above the hill. Before walking, I cannot help but take photos of the hermitage cottage’s surroundings.\n\nTwo trails led to the cafe. I took the left trail first. Along the path, several small bamboo trees grew on the side. My feet landed on some stairs made of mud and wood. At one point in the trail, I saw the mountains. Staying here for a couple of months should change anyone.\n\nWhen I reached the top, I saw a better view of Hogar and its neighboring resorts. I saw the Hogar cafe. It was open, but no one was inside. It began raining, and it was clear to me that I won’t be able to journal or meditate outdoors. So I made my way down using the right trail. I took a short detour to see what was at the end of an okra garden. What I saw was the fence that separated Hogar from a neighboring resort. On my way down, I saw a tiny snail, a baby still growing its shell. It was under a large leaf.\n\nI walked further down to catch breakfast, which was closing in about 30 minutes. After breakfast, we started preparing for the hike to Mt. Kulis. Mini, one of the organizers, led us. The walk towards the entrance of Fresno Agro-Forestry and Eco Tourist Campsite, which houses the trail to Mt. Kulis, was a wide dirt road with mud. Only cars, particularly those with large wheels, could pass. Not even tricycles or motorcycles could make it with ease. We walked on the sides. Some of us decided not to continue. The adventurous at heart pushed on. We were soon rewarded with some of the best views in Southern Luzon.\n\n![Jeep](/tlw/images/006/sikap-jeep.jpg)\n\nAlong the trail to the summit of Mt. Kulis, we saw what they called Noah’s ark from afar. But it was more like a large _balangay_ placed on top of a mountain.\n\nMeanwhile, the view at Mt. Kulis was breathtaking. It was too much to wrap one’s head around; I almost didn’t leave. While there, my friend Cris shared with me his **[Baybayin script-inspired ikebana](https://www.instagram.com/bulaklakbayin/)**. Cris plays some great music as well. He is a really aesthetically sophisticated individual.\n\nI shouldn’t have left the summit, but through persuasion, I decided to join the crew to walk to the other attractions.\n\nWe made our way back by walking again. The walk back needed the same mindfulness that brought us there, perhaps more. We reached Hogar around 12:30 pm, just in time to have lunch. I used my lunch time talking with Reg, the head of the deaf studies initiative at UP Diliman. I left the Deaf community about a decade ago. My conversation with him reminded me that there was a time in my life when I felt that advocating for the Deaf was my calling. While I no longer feel the same passion I had for sign language as I had back then, the Deaf community is still close to my heart, and I am open to doing something, anything, in the future related to Deaf culture and sign language.\n\nWhile in transit back to Los Baños, I started reading the **[essays of Shin’ichirō Imaoka](http://andrewjbrown.blogspot.com/p/free-religion.html)** on free religion. After reading the first three essays, I learned that Imaoka’s idea of free religion is seeing religion in everything. Religion, to him, is simply making the human being whole. This is the same goal of education. But it also happens in the secular areas of politics and economics. For Imaoka, everything falls under the umbrella category of religion.\n\nI read about his history of religious and spiritual training, which led him to his position as a free religionist. I learned about his precepts:\n\n1.  I believe in myself.\n2.  I believe in other people.\n3.  I believe in a cooperative society.\n4.  I believe in a universal cooperative society.\n5.  I believe in the church.\n\nI notice the concentric nature of his precepts, similar to my recent meditations on the well and walking. Religion, to him, starts within oneself and extends to the entire universe.\n\nI also read an article about the **[Unitarian Universalist Church of the Philippines](https://www.uuworld.org/articles/new-leaders-philippines)**, which made me even more curious about this religion. Imaoka was unitarian. I wonder if anyone in the UUCP shares his ideas on free religion.\n\nFrom Calamba central terminal, we rode a notoriously slow jeep to Los Baños. At first, I was pissed off at the driver. Then I remembered I just came from a retreat, which was supposed to slow everything down.\n\nPerhaps my training isn’t over.\n\n![Sleeping Jesus](/tlw/images/006/sleeping-jesus.jpg)",

But the retreat felt more like an outing than a retreat, so as I returned to Los Baños, I felt like the real retreat was just about to begin.\n\nDuring the last _sesshin_ (接心) I attended in 2018, our sensei Elda, in her closing talk, mentioned that the real sesshin begins the moment we leave the ICM Convent in Baguio, where the five-day silent retreat was held. The real _sesshin_ is out there in the world, she said. I reflect on what my life looks like, and it feels like a never-ending retreat, a pseudo-monastic life.\n\nSpeaking of _sesshins_, the first post-COVID _sesshin_ in Baguio has just culminated this November. Unfortunately, I learned about it ex post facto, so all I could do is to wait for the next one on April 2023. Sitting once more for long hours and long days in silence would be nice.\n\nIn my digital note garden, I wrote the following [[explore metaphysical and epistemological beliefs as if it was a walk|note]]:\n\n\u003e **Explore metaphysical and epistemological beliefs as if it is a walk**\n\u003e \n\u003e Perhaps developing our metaphysical beliefs also involves this careful walking. Building a home, a minimum viable one, starting with just a few principles then going out to try things out. Exposing oneself to as much beliefs as one can. But returning to the center.\n\nI remember Andrew James Brown’s similar method for what he calls **[“metaphysical hitchhiking”](http://andrewjbrown.blogspot.com/2020/12/steps-not-steps-promises-and-art-of.html)**:\n\n\u003e Well, in a nutshell, it is simply to have in mind an appropriately confident sense of the general direction and horizon towards which it seems best to travel and also to have adopted _**a general minimalist form of life and style of movement**_ that seems appropriately suited to help us take steps in that same general direction.\n\u003e \n\u003e So how on earth are we to distinguish between missteps and sidesteps and the kind of steps that seem to us to right and which move us in what we feel is the right direction? Well, that can only achieved by those who find a way with a clean heart and full belief (_pathos_) to commit loyally to some kind of _**minimal, general sense of direction of travel and an associated minimalist, or basic form of life and style of movement**_ that will help then navigate towards that horizon. (emphases mine)\n\n### November 22, Tuesday\n\nOne of the exercises in the book _**[Designing Your Life](https://designingyour.life/the-book/)**_, which I am slowly realizing is a compelling book that integrates a lot of lessons I have learned in the past about career planning and job searching, is writing your philosophy of work (workview) and philosophy of life (lifeview). After writing [[My workview]] and [[My lifeview]], I reflected on how the two relate to each other.\n\nI realized that both my worview and my lifeview have this minimalist and balanced view of money that acknowledges its importance but only as a supportive element. I internally agree that the most important things happen not in exchange spaces but in gift spaces. I realized that I have never truly been driven by money. I have been very cheap in my life and could be even cheaper if needed. The more I don’t think about how I can generate more income, the better. On a related tangent, because the main work is inner and its movement is slow, fame is not part of the equation. I am never motivated by it.\n\nThat said, I see a contradiction between my philosophy of work and my life philosophy that needs to be immediately addressed. I still see work mainly as a tool to generate income. While money is supportive, work treated simply as something secondary to the real vocation I want to do could damage how I show up in this area of life. Is there a way to treat my income-generating activities as an integrated extension of my vocation, even if that vocation happens in the gift space? This is a question I continue to ponder about.\n\n### November 23, Wednesday\n\nContinuing the exercises in *[[designing your life - burnett and evans|Designing Your Life]]*, I went down memory lane. I listed all work- and nonwork-related activities I have engaged in throughout the years and graded each in terms of engagement and energy levels. I also placed a star on activities that brought me to flow. For each activity that induced flow, I wrote a quick reflection about what was happening during each activity that made the experience incredible. The authors of the book called this a “good time journal.”\n\nWhile washing the dishes, I listened to **[a TED interview with the poet Ross Gay about joy](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ted-interview/id1437306870?i=1000584059525\u0026utm_source=substack\u0026utm_medium=email)**.\n\nIn the afternoon, I took a grounding, comforting, and pleasant walk along Pili Drive.\n\n### November 24, Thursday\n\nIn my journal, I wrote some common threads I noticed in my list of activities in my good time journal so far.\n\n\u003e -   creating stories make me flow. Either fiction or nonfiction.\n\u003e -   there are two big areas in my life: CREATIVITY \u0026 SPIRITUALITY.\n\u003e -   I do my best work when I am alone.\n\u003e -   there should always be an element of aloneness even if I want to work with other people.\n\n### November 25, Friday\n\nFrom all the activities I listed in my good time journal, I chose three: one that engaged me, energized me, and made me flow. I chose creating stories, walking, and photography for each, respectively. As the book instructed, I made a mindmap for each activity. I set a timer for six minutes and rigorously wrote the first words that came to me.\n\nAfter this, I went back to each mindmap, looked at their outer rings, and encircled three words that jumped to me. As the book instructed, I created a job description with a drawing incorporating those three words. I did this for each mind map. The results were:\n\n1.  Creating stories -\u003e sign language tour, self-directed learning, poetry -\u003e a self-directed learning poetry tour with Deaf participants\n2.  Walking -\u003e Tanay Rizal, ancient aliens, mindfulness -\u003e a history/cosmological + well-being retreat at a nature-filled environment like Tanay\n3.  Photography -\u003e journaling, indigenous peoples, numinous -\u003e a book project about indigenous creative spirituality as described in old journa\n\nThis was one of the most fun and eye-opening activities I have done in a long time. The purpose of the activity was not as much to arrive at answers as to shift my mind from “what is next” to “what is possible.” This is precisely what it did.\n\nIn the late afternoon, I walked at Jose Drilon Jr. Street alongside an arm of the Molawin Creek and sat at the end of the road to sketch my first odyssey plan, a five-year plan of the current life I was living. This was still part of the exercises in the _**Designing Your Life**_ book.\n\n### November 26, Saturday\n\nRight after waking up, Lea and I walked toward Forestry at UPLB. Under one of the sheds, we sketched our odyssey plans and presented them to each other. We drew three odyssey plans each:\n\n1.  A five-year plan of what we are currently doing or have planned for\n2.  A five-year plan for an alternative life if number one suddenly becomes impossible to realize\n3.  A five-year plan for an alternative life when money and image were no issues\n\nLea presented her three plans: as a copywriter, a dentist, and a “hippie” resort owner. Then I showed mine: a writer of many genres, a self-directed learning facilitator, and a manager of a farm for artists and learners.\n\nHere is what that last one looks like.\n\n![Odyssey plan](/tlw/images/007/odyssey-plan-3.jpg)]\n\nIn the afternoon, I read the latest Nightingalingale newsletter by **[Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/)**, a newsletter he sends to his membership patrons about the process of writing his latest book. He wrote about the importance of scale in creative projects.\n\n\u003e Scale is something I’ve discussed in the past. I think it’s one of the most “important” choices someone who is doing “creative work” has to make: What scale do you want to work at? Because so much flows from that choice.\n\u003e \n\u003e I decided ages ago that “my scale” was relatively constrained, mainly because I have a fairly uncompromising sense of what I want to do, which is not always the most \"commercially viable\" thing, and I have very little patience for bullshit. The bigger your scale, the more bullshit against which you have to defend (the more complex the thing becomes: the more moving parts, the more people involved, the more money at stake).\n\u003e \n\u003e Important to note that even small scale things can be crippled by bullshit; vigilance is critical — the worst situation is one where you’re working on a small-impact item that acts like it’s a Big Deal and comes with all attendant Big Deal Bullshit.\"\n\nAfter reading this, I returned to my odyssey plans and asked myself, “Do these plans reflect the scale that I want to work in?”\n\nI picked up new pieces of paper. There is a plan that needs revising.\n\n![Outside OJ Cafe](/tlw/images/007/OJ-cafe.jpg)",

We offer our day’s deeds  \nto the blue-eyed sky, with soap and prayer,  \nour arms up, then lowered in supplication._  \n\n~ Ruth Moose\n\nI’m **[Vince Imbat](https://vinceimbat.com/)**, and this is _**[The Long Walk](https://vinceimbat.substack.com/)**_.\n\n## The Long Walk: November 28 to December 4, 2022\n\n### November 28, Monday\n\nI encountered a Thich Nhat Hanh quote that I really like. It says:\n\n\u003e _The feeling that any task is a nuisance will soon disappear if it is done in mindfulness._\n\nI then discovered **[Bernadette Mayer](https://www.bernadettemayer.com/)**, a poet and artist whose work **[“Memory”](https://www.bernadettemayer.com/memory-1)** piqued my interest. Here is the description of Memory on Mayer’s official website:\n\n\u003e In July 1971, Mayer began experimenting with her memory. She shot a roll of 35mm film each day, and kept a rigorous daily journal. The project resulted in a staggering total of 1,100 photographs and nearly six hours of recorded poetry.\n\nPhotography and poetry as media for individual experience? Sounds like my cup of tea. You can view some of **[Mayer’s photographs here](https://www.bernadettemayer.com/memory-gallery-1)**.\n\n### November 29, Tuesday\n\nIn my journal, I reflected on what I could learn from my impatience while waiting for my laundry. I wrote:\n\n\u003e It’s funny how something as trivial as an undone laundry could affect one’s going about in life. I think a good number of evidence proves that I am an impatient person or that I have a tendency for impatience. And this triggers anger. But more importantly as it is more dangerous—it develops distrust to fellow human beings. Instead of having my laundry done by someone else, I buy a washing machine and do it myself. Instead of riding public transpo, I buy my own car and drive it myself, avoiding rude drivers, conductors, and passengers. But can we really find fault in the person who chooses to rely on himself at this day and age when quality of action and real genuine care is really low? Perhaps this is the reason why people search for churches and cling to them—little societies where the utopia could be built—where shared values and beliefs are nurtured, protected, and members find camaraderie and friends among each other.\n\n### November 30, Wednesday\n\nWhen we woke up, I invited Lea to walk with me to Freedom Park and meditate there. After meditating, it started to rain, so we had to go home.\n\nBack home, I tried journaling, but words won’t come out. So I did what I often do when words don’t come: I drew.\n\n![Handwritten Lumot poem](/tlw/images/008/lumot-handwritten.jpg)\n\nActually, I still wrote, but I did not generate the words. I simply hand-copied Rofel Brion’s Filipino poem _Lumot_ (moss) on a journal page using a brush pen, which I used for the first time. I then watched this **[Lynda Barry video on following a wandering line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtb2M2SmeuA)** and did the exercise around the poem. Lynda Barry is one of my favorite artists, and I even became more fond of her after learning that she was half Filipino.\n\nI watched another of her videos, the one about **[using the brush pen to make vertical lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdk5JTClJkE)**. After seeing the lines, I felt the urge to draw a portrait. So I drew Rofel’s portrait in the middle of the lines. I showed it to Rofel, and thankfully he liked it!\n\n![Rofel Brion portrait](/tlw/images/008/rofel-brion-portrait.jpg)\n\n### December 1, Thursday\n\nOn Rem Tanauan’s 40th day after his passing, along with his family and a few friends, we remembered, once more, how much we lost.\n\n### December 2, Friday\n\nI set on an eight to nine-hour trip from Los Baños to Pangasinan. While in transit, I chatted with a Pangasinense _kumukurit_ (writer) who writes _anlong_ (poems) like me. He befriended me the night before, perhaps after seeing **[my poem at TLTD](https://tldtd.org/poet/vince-imbat/)**, and started a conversation about the state of Pangasinan literature. Through **[Melchor E. Orpilla](https://www.facebook.com/melchor.orpilla.1)**, a social studies teacher at Unibersidad de Dagupan, I learned that an existing group champions the Pangasinan language and its literature. The group’s name is Ulupan na Pansiansiay Salitan Pangasinan (UPSP), which roughly translates to the Association of Preserving the Pangasinan Language. The group has a magazine, the _Balon Silew_ (New Light), and a small but vibrant community of Pangasinan writers do exist. Learning about this was a relief. I was both inspired and intimidated. Here are writers with a deeper knowledge of my mother tongue than I do, who write poems and self-publishes them while recognizing that readers are few and all efforts are but a resuscitation of an **[endangered language](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1061225/pangasinan-as-language-on-brink-of-extinction)**. Meanwhile, I left Pangasinan because I couldn’t find a community of artists there, writing _anlong_ from afar.\n\nMelchor E. Orpilla has written a book of poems, **[Lainëng ed Casborran](https://www.amazon.com/Laineng-Casborran-Melchor-Espeleta-Orpilla/dp/154271673X),** and a **[translation of a Katipunan colonel’s war memoir](https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/literature/historian-finishes-translating-katipunan-colonel-war-memoirs/)**.\n\n### December 3, Saturday\n\nI had dinner and some laughter in the company of family.\n\n### December 4, Sunday\n\nAfter meditation and journaling, I wrote a poem in Pangasinan in my journal using the brush pen, then translated it into Filipino and English.\n\nI leave you with these poems.\n\n![Handwritten Kabuwasan ed Cablong](/tlw/images/008/kabuwasan-ed-cablong.jpg)\n\n**UMAGA SA CABLONG**\n\n_Naghaharutan ang mga bata  \nsa kalsada parang  \nmga pipit sa bubong.  \nSubalit ikaw  \ntaimtim mong hinahayaang  \nisayaw ng hangin  \nang mga dahon mong  \nnagpapanariwa  \nsa mga kaluluwa namin._  \n\n***\n\n**MORNING IN CABLONG**\n\n_Children romp on the streets  \nlike these sparrows  \non the roof.  \nBut you,  \nyou earnestly allow  \nthe wind to sway  \nyour leaves  \nthat mend  \nour souls._  ",

    "title": "When I Look Up at the Night Sky",
    "content": "\n![Moonlight](/tlw/images/009/moonlight.jpg)\n\nWhen I got off the bus on the evening of December 2, there was a single tricycle waiting at the entrance of the provincial road that would lead me home. Its LED lights shined brightly as the driver waited silently in the dark.\n\nI approached him and asked, Can you bring me to Sitio Bayog? He spoke gently, respectfully, almost in a whisper: No, I'm waiting for someone.\n\nSince it became clear to me that I had missed my last ride, I turned towards home to start walking. But the driver spoke again. If you want, you can ride with us. My child is already at Tebag.\n\nAnd so I went back to the tricycle and sat behind him. Your son is studying? I asked. Yes. Third-year engineering student at UCU, he said.\n\nAfter about a minute or so, his son arrived across the road around the same point where I got off the bus a few moments ago. He ran toward us when the road was clear and went straight inside the sidecar. The driver turned the engine on, and we started our way toward Payas.\n\nThroughout our eight-minute ride together, in between long silences, we talked about the rising incidence of holdups in the area and people we both know (mostly my aunts and uncles). When we arrived at the entrance to Garcia Street, he stopped and asked if I wanted him to enter. I said, No need. I can walk.\n\nI got off and held his shoulders with my right arm. Thank you so much uncle, I said. May I know your name? Again, with his gentle, almost silent voice, he said, I'm Oscar.\n\nAfter saying another round of thanks, I saw the father and son off and started walking the short walk home. It was around 6:30 pm, and the sky was dark enough for me to see the stars.\n\nI've been here for more than a week and have intentionally walked in the evening to stare at the night sky. This is embarrassing to admit, but before the Ginhawa Breathing Space event at Tanay, which I attended last month, I never really knew what lights I was looking at at the heavens when I raised my head at night. All I knew then was that the lights that flickered were stars, while the lights that shined steadily were planets.\n\nUsing the SkyView app on my phone and the pointers I remember from the stargazing session we did at Tanay, I can now identify Mars, Jupiter, Neptune, and the constellations Orion, Taurus, Gemini, Aries, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. Some nights, when I feel more geeky than usual, or when there is too much cloud in the sky, I would identify a completely unfamiliar star, usually, the one that shines the brightest.\n\n![Construction site](/tlw/images/009/construction-site-night.jpg)\n\nI've been doing this walking and stargazing for more than a week now that yesterday, I started to feel something—something both familiar yet seldomly felt. When I look long enough at celestial beings—the stars, the planets, and the moon (especially the moon)—something unexpected happens.\n\nI start to feel small and insignificant.\n\nI remember that the star I am looking at now was probably already dead thousands or billions of years ago, and what I am seeing is only the light it has emitted long ago—a light that is older than me, older than anyone alive on earth today, older than my great, great ancestors.\n\nAnd with this reminder comes the recognition that everything I am looking at above came before me. And, like them, I arose from nowhere. This existence that I possess came outside my volition. I was brought here by someone (or something) that is way more powerful than myself. My existence was never my choice. It was beyond my control, much like almost everything else around me—aging, illness, and death.\n\nInterestingly, I recently came across [[thich nhat hanh]]’s English translation of The Five Remembrances of Buddhism.\n\n*I am of the nature to grow old.  \nThere is no way to escape growing old.*  \n\n*I am of the nature to have ill health.  \nThere is no way to escape ill health.*  \n\n*I am of the nature to die.  \nThere is no way to escape death.*  \n\n*All that is dear to me and everyone I love  \nare of the nature to change.  \nThere is no way to escape being separated from them.*  \n\n*My actions are my only true belongings.  \nI cannot escape the consequences of my actions.  \nMy actions are the ground upon which I stand.*  \n\n![Irrigation road at night](/tlw/images/009/irrigation-road-night.jpg)\n\nWhen I look up at the sky, I am also reminded of the question that has troubled human beings for millennia—a question that continues to perplex philosophers, scientists, and theologians: Where did all of these come from?\n\nWhen I think about this question, I remember Aristotle and the notion of the \"[[Unmoved Mover]]\" in Book XI of his _Metaphysics_. The most basic argument behind the notion of the Unmoved Mover is that everything that is in motion was moved by something else. However, there cannot be an infinite cause of moving things because this goes against the rules of logic. Infinity in the physical universe cannot exist! This means one thing: there has to be an ultimate cause.\n\nOnce this agreement is reached, we face a new problem: What is the nature of this Unmoved Mover? This ultimate cause could never be moved—it is unmoved. Otherwise, it was also caused by something else. Likewise, it shouldn't be made of physical matter. Otherwise, it is subject to change and, therefore, moved. As if that isn't enough, it also must lack potentiality. Therefore, it is simply actuality.\n\nThe nature of this \"thing\"—this Unmoved Mover—is so mysterious that I cannot help but feel awe as I contemplate it while looking up at the night sky. And this feeling—this awe—is interesting because it feels so sharply in contrast to the ego expansion that happens when I am in the social world.\n\nWhen surrounded by people in broad daylight (or electric light), my ego wants to be seen. Like a hungry wolf, it cries—cries for attention. But whenever I walk under the dim light of the stars or the soft light of a full moon, enveloped by this constellation of darkness, silence, and slowness, my ego shrinks—quite rapidly. And with this shrinking comes the peeling off of layers and layers of my onion self until what is left is emptiness—the empty space where everything else flows.\n\nIn this space something weird happens, something which Jeanette Winterson caught accurately:\n\n\u003e I have noticed that when all the lights are on, people tend to talk about what they are doing—their outer lives. Sitting round in candlelight or firelight, people start to talk about how they are feeling—their inner lives. They speak subjectively, they argue less, there are longer pauses.\n\u003e \n\u003e To sit alone without any electric light is curiously creative. I have my best ideas at dawn or at nightfall, but not if I switch on the lights—then I start thinking about projects, deadlines, demands, and the shadows and shapes of the house become objects, not suggestions, things that need to be done, not a background to thought.\n\nIsn't this exactly what we need right now?\n\nIn a time where it is so difficult to love others let alone love ourselves, we need the darkness of the night more than anything else to allow the possibility of vulnerability and, therefore, love and compassion.\n\nCarl Sagan said it precisely:\n\n\u003e For small creatures such as we the vastness of the universe is bearable only through love.\n\nLove is what will get us through this wonderful yet frightening existence. Love is what will get us through all of the things beyond our control—growing old, ill health, and death—all the more so because, while nature is beautiful, nature can also be very, very harsh.\n\nThis seemingly paradoxical quality of nature was articulated beautifully through this quote from Terrence Malick's brilliant film _Tree of Life_, which I shall leave here to end this essay.\n\n\u003e The nuns taught us there are two ways through life, the way of Nature and the way of Grace. You have to choose which one you’ll follow.\n\u003e \n\u003e Grace doesn’t try to please itself. Accepts being slighted, forgotten, disliked. Accepts insults and injuries.\n\u003e \n\u003e Nature only wants to please itself. Get others to please it too. Likes to lord it over them. To have its own way. It finds reasons to be unhappy when all the world is shining around it. And love is smiling through all things.\n\u003e \n\u003e They taught us that no one who ever loves the way of grace ever comes to a bad end.\n\u003e \n\u003e I will be true to you. Whatever comes.\n\n![Cloudy night sky](/tlw/images/009/cloudy-night-sky.jpg)",

    "content": "\n![Fisherman silhouette](/uman/images/001/fisherman-silhouette.jpg)\n\nHello. Kumusta?\n\nAn entire month of 2022 is all but gone. Nothing makes me feel how short the days are than the passing of the first month of the year. I don't know. Perhaps it has something to do about how long we waited for it only to see it disappear in a whim.\n\nHow was your 2022 so far?\n\nMe, my January has been both difficult and fun. This email you are reading is the product of my first month of the year. Moving forward, I intend to send you an email every second day of the month just to keep in touch and share what has been happening within and around me. I am calling this new emails _“Uman”_—which means “change” in Pangasinan.\n\nI have now retired Lilim and the weekly newsletter schedule. Speaking of which, you can still read the first season here, and I will soon upload the second season. For now, I want to try out this monthly email schedule and see if I could sustain it more.\n\nSo welcome to _Uman_. This is its first issue. Nothing much here. Just a reportage of what I have done (or have not done)—a sort of accountability platform that hopes to nurture this culture of sharing, openness, and vulnerability, which I have always enjoyed from writing this sort of emails.\n\n## Studies\n\nIn January 2022, I finished reading the book [A Philosophy of Walking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18339944-a-philosophy-of-walking) by Frédéric Gros. I am still in the process of reviewing my highlights and writing permanent notes. I'll share my notes to you when they are ready. I also deeply reflected on the article [The Moderate-Minded Writer](https://mattnisbet.substack.com/p/the-moderate-minded-writer) by Matthew Nisbet. You can check my literature notes [[The Moderate-Minded Writer - Nisbet|here]]. Finally, I am currently dipping myself into the life and work of Thich Nhat Hanh. I started by reading his biography in the Plum Village website [here](https://plumvillage.org/about/thich-nhat-hanh/thich-nhat-hanh-full-biography/).\n\n## Projects\n\n### Annual review\n\nSince it is the beginning of the year, I conducted my annual review, improving my process along the way. You can read my 2021 annual review article [here](/2021-annual-review/).\n\n### Learn web design\n\nOne of my intentions this year was to enhance how I share my work by designing and developing a fully customized website. For this to happen, I need to study web design and development. To start learning about design, I took [Flux’s Free Web Design Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXC_gcsKLD6n7p6tHPBxsKjN5hA_quaPI).\n\n### Learn web development\n\nTo learn web development, I bought the bestselling Udemy course by Dr. Angela Yu: [The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). I have only started the course but I can already say that Dr. Yu's teaching style is very down-to-earth.\n\n### Kaliskis na Ulap\n\nTo practice my web development skills, I decided to learn how to build a static site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The result was [Kaliskis na Ulap](https://kaliskisnaulap.com/), a website that will house my translations on Thoreau's writings. You can collaborate by writing your own translations on the passages and sending them to me via the website. You can join the project [here](https://www.craft.do/s/LXnNJVva6enIph).\n\n## Others\n\nAfter the new year, I wasn’t feeling particularly good. I had a tough time just starting my projects that I can’t believe I managed to finish a few of them. I am so grateful for the support of friends and loved ones, who helped me get past those tough days.\n\nAside from playing card and board games, I enjoyed watching [Pan de Salawal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XNSWSK1ZuA) and [The Forty-Year-Old Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRpGNnaDzeE). I also enjoyed listening to Tame Impala’s synth pop album [Currents](https://open.spotify.com/album/79dL7FLiJFOO0EoehUHQBv?si=Cy8p4TqPQ1O5Q4dBgn810Q), and Emily Dickinson’s poem [“I’m Nobody! Who are you?”](https://poets.org/poem/im-nobody-who-are-you-260) was my best discovery this month.\n\nWalks taken: Usual walks in UP, a walk to Tadlac Lake with Lea, a stroll around Lipa with my friend Rem, another along Pili Drive with Ju, and an evening walk at Jamboree road along an illuminated road and under a large red moon.\n",

    "content": "![Dog](/uman/images/002/dog.jpeg)\n\nFebruary has faded. March has come.\n\nThis is [Uman](/tags/uman), a monthly newsletter of changes, now with a “logo-ish”—the tetragram for the word “change” ([𝌡](https://unicode-table.com/en/1D321/)) from the [*Tài Xuán Jīng*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taixuanjing), chosen with no reason other than because it looks like a stout letter “U.”\n\nAnd that is what this newsletter is about—funny symbols—no, I mean… changes.\n\nI’m [Vince Imbat](https://vinceimbat.com/), in case you have forgotten who is sending you these emails, and here are some changes I went through in my life this month.\n\n## Studies\n\n### Thay and self-actualization\n\nThis month, I finished reading Thich Nhat Hanh’s [extended biography](https://plumvillage.org/about/thich-nhat-hanh/thich-nhat-hanh-full-biography/). One of my favorite insights from reading about his life is his formula for true happiness: Understanding → Compassion → Happiness. I realized through him that outer work enhances one’s inner work and that inner work is genuinely just preparation for serving the world (or a small chunk of it), which heightens one’s experience of self-fulfillment. No one has genuinely finished their inner work without fulfilling their outer work.\n\nMy contemplation on the relationship of compassion and individual happiness coincided with my re-reading of [Scott Barry Kaufman’s](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/) book [Transcend](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/books/transcend/), which explains his modification of [Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/sailboat-metaphor/) in detail. The book argues that human beings can transcend pure self-preservation in pursuit of selfless acts, ironically making them truly happy.\n\nAside from Thay’s biography, I also read the [14 precepts of the Order of Interbeing](https://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/the-14-mindfulness-trainings/) and the moving poem [“The Fire that Consumes My Brother.”](https://www.mindfulnessbell.org/archive/2015/11/poem-the-fire-that-consumes-my-brother)\n\nThinking about Thay and self-actualization, I can’t help but think about my purpose. This month, I reviewed and rewrote my purpose and updated my mission statement.\n\n### Defining my field\n\nPerhaps, it is too late for me to do this. Still, as an independent creative, exploring my creative voice for so long already, mainly through writing and supporting myself as a freelance editor along the way, I only realized how important it was to articulate precisely the kind of work I want to do (or have been doing) just last year. I have been calling myself a writer for so long, but what kind and about what? With the Talahardin now fully working and some good writing habits under my belt, I started articulating who I was as a life worker last year. The process is not yet over, though.\n\nAs a sub-project to this more significant project of articulating my life work, I decided to spend some time this month researching what field of knowledge I see myself aligned with. I knew that I wanted to engage in some form of philosophy. I have dropped “spirituality” or “religion” as a field because I wanted to free myself from dogma as much as possible. I wanted to see things as they really are, independent of prior assumptions.\n\nBut I didn’t want to engage in pure [[The Crime of Professional Philosophy|academic philosophy]]. I wanted a philosophy that was practical and grounded in everyday life and individual experience. I wanted a philosophy that makes a human being better. So I searched for any field or area of work where contemplation and philosophizing are combined.\n\nIn my search this month, I ran into Ran Lahav’s article [“Philosophical Practice as Contemplative Philosophy.”](http://www.society-for-philosophy-in-practice.org/journal/pdf/8-1%2003%20Lahav%20-%20Contemplative.pdf) This article introduced me to the [philosophical practice](https://philopractice.org/) movement, which popularized the use of philosophy in counseling. It also introduced me to [Deep Philosophy](https://dphilo.org/), which was Lahav’s reinvention of philosophical practice—a practice that proposes the use of philosophical text for contemplation.\n\nI was intrigued. Here was someone who seemed to be already doing what I was thinking about doing. I bought Lahav’s book [Deep Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/What-Deep-Philosophy-inner-depth/dp/1947515098) and started reading it. It wasn’t too long, though, before I realized his approach puts an uneven bias towards contemplation and an almost complete rejection of careful abstract reasoning. Although his work provides an excellent jump-off point, it wasn’t exactly what I wanted.\n\nThis got me thinking more about this seemingly never-ending dichotomy between rationalism and empiricism as the ultimate source of knowledge. To help me better understand this distinction, I [read more about it](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/).\n\n## Projects\n\n### Learn web development\n\nI continued learning Dr. Angela Yu’s course [The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). Specifically, I deepened my familiarity with HTML. One of the biggest lessons I had about learning how to code is to know when to stop. It can be pretty overwhelming but addictive, so it is difficult to take a break or drop the project altogether. Coding (for me) is complex as it is not my natural way of thinking. So if I am going to do this more often, I have to learn how to be a more mindful coder.\n\n### Talahardin\n\nI found and implemented a solution to use a custom domain name for my Talahardin (garden of notes). Previously, I only linked to [https://www.craft.do/s/DNUP0iZyULDr15](https://www.craft.do/s/DNUP0iZyULDr15). Now, you can access my notes at [https://notes.vinceimbat.com/](https://notes.vinceimbat.com/). It is easier to access the notes now as the domain name is easier to remember. I followed a solution by the friendly developer [Zuo Lan](https://zuolan.me/craft_custom_domain_en).\n\n### Kaliskis na Ulap\n\nUsing the exact solution I discovered in using a custom domain name for my Talahardin, I created a custom domain name for my collection of Thoreau translations. The main website is still in [kaliskisnaulap.com](https://kaliskisnaulap.com/). But the translation collections are now accessible in: [salin.kaliskisnaulap.com](https://salin.kaliskisnaulap.com/).\n\n### Migrating vinceimbat.com from WordPress to Hugo\n\nSince I am already confident with my basic website building skills using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and I have found a way to use a custom domain URL for my Talahardin, I decided to start migrating my website [vinceimbat.com](https://vinceimbat.com/) from WordPress to Hugo. I successfully migrated everything using an [exporter](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown).\n\nAfter migrating, I wrote a new [home page](https://vinceimbat.com/) and [about page](https://vinceimbat.com/about/) using Dave Ursillo’s [Story Shine](https://daveursillo.com/story-shine/) process. If you have time, I would appreciate it if you [let me know](mailto:vince@vinceimbat.com) what you think about these pages.\n\n### Lilim\n\nAfter migrating my site to Hugo, I included some new content. [Lilim](tags/lilim), my now archived newsletter, has its second season fully uploaded to the site. I also added a previously unpublished season 1 issue, [[Lilim 5 - Autonomy Makes a Long Life|Lilim 01(05) — Autonomy Makes a Long Life]], a fully updated account about the free birth process of a couple I was privileged to meet last year.\n\n## Others\n\nI turned 30 this year. I feel sooooo old. But in a good way. I feel more confident about myself now—something I didn’t have when I was in my early 20s.\n\nMore good news: Provincial buses bound to Northern Luzon continue to open up, and travel seems to ease up even to unvaccinated passengers. I was able to go home to Pangasinan and spend time with my parents, who are getting older by the day. As I am writing this, my mom may just have gone through a procedure that might save her rapidly deteriorating vision. She has diabetes.\n\nAlso, I finally saw my nephew and niece for the first time since March 2019 and my other new niece for the first time ever.",

    "title": "𝌡 Uman — March 2022",
    "content": "![Journaling at Yellow Trail](/uman/images/003/journaling-yellow-trail.jpg)\n\nThe summer heat has arrived in all its double-edged glory. First, you see it in the greenery. Plants and trees are flowering, yet leaves are also withering. Then you can feel it on your skin. You want to be outdoors longer than usual, but once out, you start complaining about the heat.\n\nWith this change in season comes this March dispatch of [[tags/uman/_index|Uman]], a monthly newsletter of changes, which I, [Vince Imbat](https://vinceimbat.com/), have started to call “a monthly newsletter that documents what it means to pursue philosophy and contemplation independently as a way of life.”\n\nA mouthful. But don’t mind this description too much. Like summer, this too shall change.\n\n## Studies\n\nI spent the bulk of this month thinking about the question, “What motivates us, humans?” I was interested in the conscious or unconscious reasons behind our actions. Psychology holds most of the answers to this question, so I stayed there for most of March. However, I also reviewed philosophical answers that provide illuminating insights into this fundamental and practical question.\n\n### Positive psychology vs. humanistic psychology\n\nI was interested in the difference between two branches of psychology that study the brighter side of the human mind (i.e., how humans can be the best version of themselves) as opposed to the darker side (i.e., why humans are crazy). These two branches are positive psychology and, its older sister, humanistic psychology.\n\nI read [“The History of Positive Psychology”](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Froh-2004.pdf) by Jeffrey Froh, whose main thesis is that positive psychology owes a lot to humanistic psychology and yet distances itself from it. Froh argues that positive psychology can only “self-actualize” if it recognizes its humanistic past.\n\nI also read [“The Humanistic Psychology–Positive Psychology Divide”](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Humanistic-Positive-Psychology-Divide-AP.pdf) by Alan Waterman. His main thesis is that the philosophical differences between humanistic and positive psychology are so deep that any attempt to reconcile them will be difficult if not futile. He suggests that each branch of psychology should pursue its own work separately. However, after reading the works of [Scott Barry Kaufmann](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/), especially his latest book [Transcend](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/books/transcend/), which I started to re-read [[uman/002|last month]], I conclude that it is possible, and perhaps even necessary, to combine insights and approaches from both branches to come up with a more complete understanding of the human mind.\n\n### The meaning of life\n\nNo study of human motivation is complete without thinking about purpose. For individual actions, the purpose is the articulated reason or intention. For a human life in general, the purpose is the large articulated motivation from which every single action draws meaning.\n\nTo think more about purpose, I re-read the last chapter of the book [*What Does It All Mean?*](https://vinceimbat.com/what-does-it-all-mean/) to refresh me with the question of the meaning of life. I then started reading the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on [the meaning of life](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/life-meaning/). The entry made me realize that happiness, although important, is not the ultimate goal. But if [error theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/#ErroTheo) (the theory that absolute objective values do not exist) is correct anyway, then there actually is no ultimate goal whatsoever.\n\nTo help me think more about “ultimate goal\" or “life purpose,” I read, for the first time, a portion of John Mackie’s book [*Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/692765.Ethics). His argument is that this thinking that there is one ultimate good relies on the same problematic assumptions that moralists subscribe to—that there are absolute, universal values. Per the error theory, which Mackie himself authored, no such things exist. Therefore, we can still choose to direct our life toward an ultimate good, but we are making a grave mistake if we assert that this ultimate good is objective and absolute (i.e., everyone must live their lives according to it).\n\nIf I subscribe to the error theory in thinking about my life purpose, then I could choose any purpose now and change it anytime. This is possible because I have full control of my purpose—I rely only on myself in determining what purpose to live for. For the time being, my minimum viable purpose will be to self-actualize and transcend (i.e., to fulfill all my needs for security so that I could grow as a person and live my life in the service of humanity). This could change as I deepen my understanding of purpose and human motivation.\n\nWhile walking one afternoon as I was thinking about these ideas, I realized that I may have committed a serious mistake by equating purpose with meaning. Purpose is simply an answer to the question of why you are doing what you are doing. It is the reason behind an action. Meaning is the interpretation of an object, concept, event, or human life. When life is said to be “meaningful” it probably simply means, we can “say more” about it because it means more to people and that is possible because more significant things happened in that life. Both purpose and meaning are concepts, which mean they owe their existence to our mind. Both are contents and creations of the mind but are differentiated because they serve different objectives. One way of describing the relationship between the two is that by living with purpose (i.e., being very intentional about your actions and life in general), you create a more meaningful life.\n\nOn a similar tangent, I wrote a very fruitful [[Approach life with humor|note]] on the relationship between nihilism and approaching life with humor. While writing it, I re-read Austin Kleon’s [article](https://austinkleon.com/2020/11/19/the-comedy-of-survival/) on the book, [*The Comedy of Survival*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/701314.The_Comedy_of_Survival).\n\n### Life Management System\n\nInspired by my thinking about purpose and motivation this month, I realized that I need a more systematic way of tackling my goals. Through a journaling session, I wrote a draft of an outline of my life management system implementation. I then wrote a [[How to build a life management system|note]] for this. On that note, I articulated what my reviews are meant to do. Now, I just have to think really deeply about project management. This will be a study project for April or May.\n\n### Philosophy outside academia\n\nFor a day this month, I also reviewed my resources on doing philosophy outside academia. I re-read the [*Don’t Go Back to School*](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17726184) chapter on [Benjamen Walker](https://theoryofeverythingpodcast.com/), the radio host who taught himself philosophy. My most important takeaway from Walker is that grad school has a very specific way of learning that accommodates a very specific person—a specialist who focuses on a single subject. The more generalist and the adventurous learner will be judged as not good enough in grad school. I also learned from him that it is possible to learn a subject matter competently and even better independently outside academia. Lastly, Walker’s example is a great model for how public production and conversation (via radio and podcast) can become a very potent framework to learn philosophy independently and build a philosophical career of one’s own.\n\nI also read the Introduction of the book, which featured [Kio Stark](http://www.kiostark.com/)’s own experience of dropping out of grad school. She dropped out because the method of learning didn’t work for her and was boring.\n\nAfter this, I reviewed Steve Patterson’s career. I re-read an [article](https://medium.com/@zslayback/this-guy-says-you-don-t-need-a-phd-to-be-a-professional-philosopher-f03afd459ed) that features an interview about how he approaches doing independent philosophy. His workflow of reading—shower + thinking—writing dump—revising was really interesting to me. I also watched his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzD-tjzXagM) on why he is not in academia and listened to a [podcast interview](https://www.goingdeepwithaaron.com/podcast/77-steve-patterson-freelance-philosopher-running-from-academia) of him talking more about how he does his work independently.\n\nAlong this line, I also re-read the first parts of [*Create Your Own Religion*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16278200-create-your-own-religion)*,* which was inspired by my attempt to look for other examples of individuals who have pursued independent thinking.\n\n## Projects\n\nI didn’t accomplish a lot of work-related projects this March. Most of my projects this month involved spending time with family and loved ones, letting myself explore subjects that I fancy, and doing several walks. April will probably be different, but we’ll see.\n\n## Others\n\n### Walks\n\nAs I said, I did several walks this month, mostly two-hour- to half-day-long walks.\n\nEarlier this month, I walked around Baguio town to see what has changed in two years since the pandemic. Several restaurants of note that I had pretty good memories in have either closed or relocated. For example, The Forest House has permanently closed, while Cafe by the Ruins Dua was replaced by Silantro in its old location.\n\nTwo weeks later, I would go back to Baguio to accompany my cousin and her boyfriend. We would walk the newly renovated Baguio Botanic Gardens after paying perhaps the most valuable P10 ever per person. We then walked Session Road in the evening checking out the famous and now revived Night Market. People have flocked to Baguio as restrictions continue to loosen by the day.\n\n![The orchidarium at the newly renovated Baguio Botanical Garden](/uman/images/003/orchidarium-baguio-botanical-garden.jpg \"The orchidarium at the newly renovated Baguio Botanical Garden\")\n\nAfter our day together, I would stay another day and spend half of it walking the Yellow Trail at Camp John Hay, which I haven’t walked since around 2017. I sat down under the pine trees and wrote a journal entry but had to look for shelter when started raining hard.\n\nAfter going home to Los Baños, I spent an afternoon walking inside Makiling Botanic Gardens. It was too large to walk the entire place for two hours. But management is too strict. Visitors cannot stay longer than two hours (even when I was just the only person walking inside that day!). I went down a branch of the Molawin creek, which flows inside the Gardens, then took some photos and videos while looking around at the large trees.\n\nGoing back home to Pangasinan for another five days, I discovered a new trail along Matic Matic to Maronong Road. It was a silent trail for about half of it (which I really enjoyed). Then the other half was occupied by houses. The following day, I walked the trail that forked out of the first half. That trail was silent too. I sat over dried grasses, masks off, for about half an hour while staring at the large rain clouds accumulating at the horizon.\n\n### Travel\n\nAside from my trips back to Pangasinan and Baguio, I was fortunate enough to see Taal up close at San Nicolas, Batangas, a few hours just after it blew off some dust. The famed Mt. Makulot was also beautifully visible from that vantage point.\n\n![Mt. Makulot view from San Nicolas](/uman/images/003/mt-makulot-san-nicolas.jpg \"The view of Mt. Makulot from San Nicolas, Batangas\")\n\nAs if I needed more Batangas, I spent a night and a day by the beach at Calayo, Nasugbu. Along the way, I got to see Tagaytay again after about what could have been a decade.\n\nAlbum of the month: [Duran Duran’s Rio album](https://open.spotify.com/album/02tfQwJSOLP77oCd9U8bqm?si=EGd1aOcnTcaW_q4rl6fpQA)\n\nFilm of the month: [Knives Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi-1NchUqMA)\n",

    "title": "𝌡 Uman — April 2022",
    "content": "![Kapok](/uman/images/004/Kapok.jpg)\n\nI saw someone die. It was a Monday evening. April 4. A motorcycle accident. I was on my bike, about to buy food, when I saw a large crowd gathered just past the church, where they were holding a singing contest. Behind me, I heard the voice of a young girl singing a song I can't seem to remember, drowning the cries of the middle-aged woman who was trying to punch a man standing beside a motorcycle. A younger man held her. Hugged her.\n\nIn front of them sprawled a body. Lifeless. No breathing. Blood spattered on his face, dripping on hot cement.\n\nI got off my bike and from afar, I heard a siren wailing. Blue and red lights flickered in the air.\n\nThe next morning, someone I knew died of diabetes complications. When I went home to continue reading Scott Barry Kaufman's book *Transcend*, he started talking about death.\n\nOutdoors in Elbi, the ground was filled with *kapok*. April started out with me contemplating my inevitable mortality.\n\n## Everything is Fleeting\n\nKaufman said that these \"hopefully\" occasional brushes with death are—surprisingly—good for one's mental health. People who experience them, especially those who encounter them in aging, realize that what is truly important in life are not the ups, the peak experiences that are so rare and yet so venerated. What is truly meaningful are plateau experiences: The ray of light that enters one's bedroom as the day starts. The chirping of birds at the park. A kiss from a toddler.\n\nThese experiences are less remembered than their more extravagant cousins. But this is the exact reason why they are more valuable.\n\nThis appreciation of the little things in life does not come easy especially when one is young and filled with unquenchable ambition. There is a need to go after things when one is in his early 20s. A restless itch to do. An itch that makes it unbearably difficult to stop. And when one cannot stop, we don't expect him to notice what is there, around him. The bees jumping from one flower to the next are all but an invisible spectacle.\n\nSeeing the value of plateau experiences comes only after several brushes with death and suffering—experiences, which make one wiser.\n\nI love this description of wisdom in Kaufman's book:\n\n\u003e Wisdom tends to increase with age and is most common among those with high levels of openness to experience, the capacity for self-examination and introspection, a motivation for personal growth, and the willingness to remain skeptical of one’s self-views, continually questioning assumptions and beliefs, and exploring and evaluating new information that is relevant to one’s identities.\n\nThis skepticism, this continuous challenging of one's strongly held views, this drive to seek the truth, are marks of wisdom. And here is where I see the real connection between plateau experiences, brushes with death, and wisdom: *When one wants to see the world as it really is, driven by curiosity and truth-seeking, one easily realizes that everything is fleeting. Curiosity opens one's eyes and lets one see the meaning behind all the deaths and suffering around.*\n\nIf I have not been practicing meditation, if I have not been writing in my journal every day, if I have not been contemplating the meaning of life, I would have been there at the spot where that man died that April evening and would not have cared one bit about what it means to me or to those I love.\n\nThis practice of looking closer at things and then seeing their transience opens one's eyes to their preciousness—preciousness that generates gratitude and awe. Gratitude for a gift that we never really asked for but was given to us. Awe for the realization that of the many possible existents, it is us who are breathing, here, now as if we were chosen. From all of these arises the motivation to live life as intentionally as possible.\n\nPart of encountering one's mortality is realizing how little time one has to do what one needs to do.\n\n![Memento mori calendar](/uman/images/004/Memento-mori.jpg)\n\nLast month, I bought this decent *memento mori* calendar. *Memento Mori is* Latin for \"remember death.\" Each square symbolizes a week of my life. Shaded squares are weeks I have consumed. Unshaded squares are weeks left for me to use if I'm lucky enough to reach 70. I am in the middle years of my life. If the universe is good, I can still have twice the weeks I have already consumed and some extra. What will I do with the remaining weeks of my life? That is what troubles me.\n\nIt is a question, that [***Paddleton***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs9YpUktrWw), a film I watched this April and loved very much, answered beautifully in one simple scene.\n\nMichael and Andy were neighbors who became really close friends. Both lived alone. When Michael learned that he would die of cancer and that doctors could no longer do anything, he decided to take his own life via pills prescribed by a physician. He asked for Andy's help, which led to a six-hour road trip to get the pills.\n\nA few weeks after the road trip, Michael and Andy were sitting on their couch, watching the same movie they watch every night when Michael suddenly spoke. \"I think I'm ready,\" he said. Andy turns to him surprised and a bit confused. \"I want to go when I feel good. I don't want to go when it's hurting,\" continued Michael. Andy bargains a little but Michael repeated firmly, \"I think I'm ready.\"\n\nAndy surrenders, looks back at the TV, looks up, gave a sigh, and said, \"I should have took off from work. I should have took off. A month ago. We could've done more stuff. I wish I had done that.\"\n\n![Paddleton](/uman/images/004/Paddleton.jpg)\n\n## Where Are All These Things Going?\n\nIn one journaling session this April, I started listing the intermediate creative artifacts I regularly produce during my daily creative routine: permanent notes, field notes, quotes, narratives, translations, poems, vignettes, photographs, etc. Most of them are collected inside my Talahardin, my note-writing system. For some reason, the question came to me, \"Where are all these things going?\"\n\nI mean, what's the point? What's the point of accumulating all this stuff? That was when an even more important question arrived, \"What do I really want to do with the little time I have left in this world?\"\n\nIt's not like I haven't asked this question before. It's just that I have never felt the question this strong.\n\nThe most natural answer to this question, of course, is books. I have been fantasizing about writing a book since I was in grade school. Back then it was a graphic novel. I called it *Ilaya*, a fantasy story set in a high fantasy world of *diwatas*, inspired by watching *Mulawin* and *Encantadia*.\n\nBooks occupy a significant amount of space at home. I have collected books throughout my adult life. I read books for a living. I call myself a writer. Most of the people I admire are authors. There are lots of things I am unsure of in this half-filled life—but writing a book is something I am 100% sure I want to do before it all ends.\n\nAnd so, this month, after giving it much thought, I have silently declared to myself—and perhaps publicly declare here, for the first time—that I am starting a book project. A \"real\" book project. Not the ebook projects I did in the past.\n\nThis is good. I'm gaining traction just by making up my mind. This is bad. Where do I start?\n\n## The Book I Want to Write\n\nThe most natural start is to think about what kind of book I want to write, which is the same as asking what kind of writing I want to write.\n\nI journaled further on this and discovered that I wanted to give birth to beautiful non-fiction books with photographs that combine personal narratives, philosophical thinking, cultural references, and historical descriptions all situated in a specific geographical location. In short, given my wide and sometimes sporadic interests, I couldn't just write a book with a single lens. I need multiple lenses to write it. This will make sure that the book will be a fun project to commit to.\n\nI went back to those intermediate writing artifacts I mentioned above. Then I mapped out a workflow that turns them into blog posts, newsletters, then later, books. I also wrote about what needs to happen daily, weekly, and monthly which would give me more chances of producing a book. None is final at this moment, and I have to go back to the plan. But I have looked at this closely enough to convince myself that this really matters to me right now.\n\nTo think better about these intermediate packets, I transferred my entire Talahardin from [**Craft**](https://craft.do/) to [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/). Obsidian just gives me more freedom in managing my notes and it allows me to think better about them in a way that Craft, beautiful as it is, is not really designed to do. It was a good 1 and 1/4 years of using it but I am ready to use a better tool to help me focus on really embracing a writing life centered on producing books.\n\nBut even more important than the tool is the internal system that the tool follows. Because I would like to write stuff that mixed different kinds of material, I decided to categorize my notes into specific types using tags: \\#Narratives, \\#Quotes, \\#Poetry, \\#PermanentNotes, \\#Translations, \\#FieldNotes, etc.\n\n![Dead tuko](/uman/images/004/Tuko-death.jpg)\n\n## Nature and Place-based Writing\n\nAfter I finished setting up the organization system just enough, I started playing around with writing narratives. I wrote [a vignette](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcUrvEcvYvB/) on the death of a *tuko* in my house. I wrote the piece in Filipino after receiving feedback from my girlfriend that I sound like myself more in Filipino. Of course, deciding on the language I use to write will always be a tough decision for me, given the three languages I speak. But writing more in Filipino has always been an option open for exploration. I need to try everything to really hear my voice on the page, and if that means limiting my readership to only those who can understand a certain language, so be it.\n\nI probed further on what kind of writing I wanted to bring to the world. I started drawing a creative family tree, something I saw first in *Steal Like an Artist*. I placed Thoreau at the center of the tree and then started looking for people I can connect to him. Emerson is obviously above him, although not the focal point of my tree.\n\nI found a book of tributes for Thoreau. It was entitled [***Now Comes Good Sailing***](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57423852-now-comes-good-sailing)—named after what was said to be his last words. There, I read an essay about Thoreau's influence on E.B. White, the author of [***Charlotte's Web***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24178.Charlotte_s_Web?from_search=true\u0026from_srp=true\u0026qid=vluzBPskc4\u0026rank=1). The essay was basically saying that Thoreau's influence on White was mainly technical. Their sentence constructions do sound the same in some places, although Thoreau will always be more difficult to understand than White (except in his journals, where he writes more accessibly).\n\nI also started reading Annie Dillard's book [***The Writing Life***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12530.The_Writing_Life) per recommendation by [**Craig Mod**](https://craigmod.com/). While reading the first chapter, I noticed that she reads like Thoreau. Her writing is patches of everything: history, anecdotes, intimate personal perspectives. And so I Googled if there is any connection between her and Thoreau. Lo and behold, there is! Not just a tiny thread of connection but a strong tight rope. Turns out, Dillard read Emerson and Thoreau when she was young. As a master's thesis, she wrote an analysis of Thoreau's *Walden*. She even married Robert D. Richardson, Thoreau's biographer! She loves Walden so much that her magnum opus [***A Pilgrim at Tinker Creek***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12527.Pilgrim_at_Tinker_Creek?ac=1\u0026from_search=true\u0026qid=WBBXlfAbXg\u0026rank=1), which I am currently reading, was her attempt of creating something like *Walden*—a poetic nonfiction book that ponders the deep questions of existence while at the same time deepening the meaning of a specific place. In her case, Tinker Creek, a body of water in the suburbs where she lived.\n\nHowever, unlike Thoreau, Dillard wrote her magnum opus while in a library. She wasn’t a naturalist. She was unemployed when she wrote the book. She went out to her backyard and converted it into a wilderness to such skill that people actually thought what she was describing was wilderness! And this is why I love her so much. She is much more relatable, her language much more contemporary than Thoreau's. I see her as a conduit for me to understand Thoreau better.\n\nI am still in meta-learning mode—establishing my creative family tree and seeing the works I should spend time studying. That said, I know what I am looking for—books and essays about place and nature that talk about what it means to live and draw resources from history, culture, science, philosophy, and every possible source.\n\nFollowing advice from Craig Mod and [**Gabriela Pereira**](https://diymfa.com/), I have started to build a reading list. To come up with a list, I started reading the first few pages and chapters of several highly recommended books:\n\n- [***A Week at the Concord and Merrimack Rivers***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/290587.A_Week_on_the_Concord_and_Merrimack_Rivers?from_search=true\u0026from_srp=true\u0026qid=mXdfC6ANHP\u0026rank=2) by Thoreau\n- [***Desert Solitaire***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214614.Desert_Solitaire?from_search=true\u0026from_srp=true\u0026qid=LpCNEbmcRy\u0026rank=1) by Edward Abbey\n- [***The Living Mountain***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13380931-the-living-mountain?from_search=true\u0026from_srp=true\u0026qid=VNghetXyjw\u0026rank=2) by Nan Shepherd\n- *A Pilgrim at Tinker Creek* by Annie Dillard\n- *Walden* by Thoreau\n\nThese are books of nature writing but I am also studying the styles of place-based and travel writers like Bruce Chatwin. I found a collection of his essays [***Anatomy of Restlessness***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79910.Anatomy_of_Restlessness?from_search=true\u0026from_srp=true\u0026qid=IQ0IzwtcNA\u0026rank=1) at Booksale and started reading the first two essays. If I changed Uman's format this month, his essay \"I Want to Go to Patagonia\" was an inspiration.\n\nThoreau's books are difficult to read, which was a surprise because I love his journal so much. It felt as if the person who wrote the books was entirely different from that who wrote the journal. Nan Shepherd's book was too out of touch, but I might give it another chance later. For now, I shall finish reading *A Pilgrim at Tinker Creek* and *Desert Solitaire*.\n\nThe decision to read Dillard was a no-brainer. After reading three chapters of the ebook, I was sold. As I said, she is like a more accessible version of Thoreau, who writes the way I want to write. She could do better in terms of conveying philosophical insights in her work, but she tries earnestly and that is enough.\n\nMeanwhile, I decided to read *Desert Solitaire* after reading an excellent essay by David Gessner entitled [**\"Sick of Nature.\"**](http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2004/08/01/sick_of_nature?pg=full) In that essay, Gessner argued that nature writing in its current state has lost most of its original spirit present in books like *Walden* where a certain quest was the central theme of the work, while nature just happens to be the backdrop where this quest happens. Instead, most contemporary nature writings have been saturated by spiritual language that romanticizes nature rather than honestly depicts it.\n\nI love this essay. It sharpened my criteria for what to include in my reading list. The kind of nature writing I am looking for is exemplified by what Gessner described:\n\n\u003e The best writing in this genre is not really \"nature writing\" anyway but human writing that just happens to take place in nature. And the reason we are still talking about \"Walden\" 150 years later is as much for the personal story as the pastoral one: a single human being, wrestling mightily with himself, trying to figure out how best to live during his brief time on earth, and, not least of all, a human being who has the nerve, talent, and raw ambition to put that wrestling match on display on the printed page. The human spilling over into the wild, the wild informing the human; the two always intermingling.\n\nGessner's essay was enough to convince me to try Edward Abbey's *Desert Solitaire*. I'm done with three chapters and really appreciate its down-to-earth voice. The book is also a collection of vignettes that come together to create a narrative. It gave me an idea on how to possibly write and organize a book: If I could write small vignettes slowly and bring them together in a way that creates a narrative, then I have a book.\n\nAside from these, I also plan to read [***A River Runs Through It***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30043.A_River_Runs_Through_it_and_Other_Stories?from_search=true\u0026from_srp=true\u0026qid=QEXUzXWhBF\u0026rank=1) by Norman Maclean (1976), [***The Rings of Saturn***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/434903.The_Rings_of_Saturn?from_search=true\u0026from_srp=true\u0026qid=TakzlhR9EM\u0026rank=1) by W.G. Sebald (1995), and [***Riding Toward Everywhere***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1231817.Riding_Toward_Everywhere?from_search=true\u0026from_srp=true\u0026qid=nDE9qNn5sG\u0026rank=1) by W.T. Vollman just to explore their styles.\n\nAs much as I wanted to read a similar book written by a Filipino, ideally also in Filipino, I haven't found one just yet. I went to Mt. Cloud at Baguio to look for one but didn't see any. The closest I saw was written by a foreigner who spent a year on an island in the Visayas. However, his writing was not what I was looking for. If you know of any such place-based writing set in a specific geographic location in the Philippines, which is brave enough to cross-pollinate personal narrative with other types of materials, ideally written by a Filipino, please send it my way.\n\nWhile reading all of these books about nature, a common practice among the authors emerged: Everyone described specific moments of deep observation of particular phenomena in nature. Thoreau and Dillard wrote these observations in their journals. I would wager that most nature writers keep field notes and journals. Because of this, I was inspired to go back to writing field notes during my walks, which I rewrite as vignettes in my journal. Here's a recent example, which I wrote in Filipino:\n\n\u003e Pababa na ang araw pero maliwanag pa rin. Maputlang kunti ang sinag nito. Hindi matapang na orange. Mainit sa balat.\n\n\u003e May mga nahulog na mangga. Meron ding mga pirasong halatang binalatan. Kinain. Walang mga prutas sa mangga na nasa tapat ng mga ito. Galing ba ang mga ito sa puno? O nahulog ng nakabisikletang dumaan?\n\n\u003e Malamig ang simoy ng hangin. Kahit na hindi naman natuloy ang pinakaaasam na ulan kanina. Masarap huminga rito. Malamig at magaan ang hangin. Para akong hinihele.\n\n\u003e May mga tanim na okra sa harapan ko. Pero tila napabayaan na sila. Nilamon ng mga gumagapang na halaman. Pinayuko. Malalaki at matatanda na ang mga bunga ng okra. Lupa na at hindi tao ang kakain sa kanila.\n\n![Sunset at Lobong CIS](/uman/images/004/Lake-sunset.jpg)\n\nAll of these. This intentional remembering of the shortness of my life. This commitment to write a book. And before that, to read my predecessors. I see all of these as a manifestation of courage. The courage to claim who one is.\n\nI am a writer. Not everyone will agree. But not everyone matter.\n\nThis is what I want to do. Probably not forever since I am more than this. But that's okay. For now, I claim what I am sure of.\n\nEverything is fleeting. I have consumed half the number of my weeks. I might as well go out for a walk now, and come back home later to my office to write about it.\n\nWhat else should I do?\n",

    "content": "![A family at Freedom Park](/uman/images/005/Freedom-park-now.jpeg \"A family sits on what used to be an internment camp at Freedom Park\")\n\nNot so long ago, I wrote about the [[The Happiness In Self-Forgetfulness|happiness in self-forgetfulness]]. I wrote about that incredible feeling of exhilaration we encounter when we are so captivated by something else we forget about our anxieties. We usually experience this when we read a good book, listen to a piece of tantalizing music, or watch a well-executed film. Some would say we are escaping reality when we consume such good art. But I think a more accurate description of what is happening here is that we are running away from that ever domineering self-consciousness that Dillard called “a bitter birthday present from evolution.” Even more surprising is that from this forgetting comes peace of mind and healing—a silencing of troubles.\n\nHowever, I notice that we do self-forgetfulness easily when we are in front of media—screens or book pages (which are now also screens). These are the modern tools of transcendence. I am using transcendence here very loosely, but with good reasons. I believe that our experience of transcendence lies in a spectrum of different varieties and intensities. There are deeper forms of transcendence as shared by, say, serious meditators, but there are more ordinary and common forms that are readily accessible by anyone. As long as you have “escaped” self-consciousness, whatever you are doing, you have transcended. Flow, that ever-popular word referring to what artists and athletes experience when “in the zone,” is a form of transcendence. But even that lies on the farther edges of the spectrum. A more common form of transcendence is what we usually experience when consuming information stored in media. This form of transcendence is easier. It’s easier to be captivated by a Netflix movie than the silence of an empty room where you are sitting in the middle.\n\n## Media-less Transcendence\n\nHowever, this over-reliance on media could stunt our ability to be alone with our senses. Yes, we are toolmakers and tool users, but earlier in our evolution, we only had our hands and mind to use, and we seem to have completely forgotten that those were enough for a very long time. It is important to experience self-forgetfulness and transcendence as organic as possible (i.e., through our bare senses) at least once in a while. It is harder, yes, but the experience is more enlightening, insightful, and freeing. Why? Because it puts us in direct contact with reality. And reality isn’t orchestrated like the story in a film or a book or a song. Reality is messy—a fluctuating arrangement (or perhaps disarrangement) of atoms and photons.\n\nThere is an important difference between these two ways of experiencing the world—two ways of seeing as Dillard describes it:\n\n\u003e The difference between the two ways of seeing is the difference between walking with and without a camera. When I walk with a camera I walk from shot to shot, reading the light on a calibrated meter. When I walk without a camera, my own shutter opens, and the moment's light prints on my own silver gut. When I see this second way I am above all an unscrupulous observer.\n\nIf being alone with your thoughts in a room is fatally difficult, try another form of organic experience that I discovered can be extremely transcendental: listening—pure listening with no intention of responding.\n\nWhen I listen to someone talk, I still consume structured or possibly even coordinated information. But there is an unexplainable quality to face-to-face conversations that make them richer than video or voice calls. Yet rightfully so. I am interacting with hormone-releasing flesh, not a radiation-emitting screen. Furthermore, even when it is structured, a conversation is still not immune from the vagueness of reality. It could lead anywhere; countless things could happen. It mimics the messy nature of reality. And yet, despite the mess, if I listen closely, without thinking about what to say back but simply being present with the other person, I inevitably forget about myself. I seem to become the other person, not in that magical wuwu way, but naturally and imaginatively, that happens within my own subjective experience.\n\nIronically, we couldn’t dismiss that curated information in media makes transcendence easier. The mind needs structure for it to quiet down. Give it form, and it will surrender itself, calm down, and ultimately forget. And this is what I love about reading. Reading feels like listening to someone talk for a long time without me thinking about responding, but in a well-structured and coordinated manner. When I read a good book, I find myself transcend—I forget that I am even existing.\n\nSo, I guess the path to self-forgetfulness is not a straight singular one. There are so many other roads towards it, and to ignore the others in favor of one is simply absurd and deprived. The more tools we have, the more resilient we are because if one tool is unavailable, we can still get the job done. In self-forgetfulness, we need to experience both media-assisted and media-less methods, then learn when to use each one appropriately. This principle of embracing different strategies, of trying other techniques, does not only apply to transcendence. It applies to almost every single pursuit in life.\n\n![A blue dilapidated building](/uman/images/005/blue-crumpled-house.jpeg)\n\n## How Two Birds Taught Me to Walk and Write Better\n\nEarly in May, I took a brief walk at Victoria M. Ela Avenue inside the UPLB campus. I started walking out of the house around 5 pm, so the sun was no longer that dark. I had to go home by 7 pm for dinner, so I only had two hopefully good hours to walk. At Ela, I stopped at the bridge and looked down at the Molawin creek. On the stream, I saw two birds cross the water towards the other bank full of stones. They looked like bush hens with long slender feet. They separated for a while in a very coordinated manner, as if identical birds were walking in separate directions or raptors hunting in sync. A few moments later, the two birds met again. They walked some more until they vanished under the shades of banana leaves. When they disappeared, the church bell nearby rang, and a teal kingfisher flew by.\n\nI wrote all of these in my field notes. But not long after this, it started to get dark, and I began to feel tired. I walked a bit at Freedom Park, then made my way home. While walking home, I couldn’t shake off what I had just seen, and that was when I realized I walked for about two hours but only witnessed a single of these moments worth writing. I only found a single piece of Dillard’s pennies.\n\nI went home that evening with a clear intention, brought by the feedback I received while actively doing something. From now on, I decided to extend my walking hours. I reasoned that if I could capture a single penny in two hours, I might catch another or more in four hours of walking. A few days after this, I did another walk, but now I started about an hour earlier, and boy was I rewarded with pennies at that walk!\n\nJust the act of extending time led me to write longer, more beautiful field notes that ultimately convinced me to relaunch Lilim, my once-archived weekly newsletter on walking. Since May 15, I have published four Lilim issues:\n\n- [[Lilim 25 - A Mask of Darkness with No Eyes|Lilim, 03(01) — A Mask of Darkness with No Eyes]]\n- [[Lilim 26 - All Them Dirt Roads|Lilim, 03(02) — All Them Dirt Roads]]\n- [[Lilim 27 - An Unwrapped Gift From the Universe|Lilim, 03(03) — An Unwrapped Gift From the Universe]]\n- [[Lilim 28 - Ang Heograpiya ng Buhay|Lilim 03(04) — Ang Heograpiya ng Buhay]]\n\nFeedback is everything in life, but more especially in the writing life. Last May, I finished reading _[DIY MFA](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/26483784-diy-mfa)_ by Gabriela Pereira, and there I came across a concept that I am very familiar with. I use it to start and maintain habits and systems. The idea is **[iteration](https://vinceimbat.com/minimum-viable-worldview/)**. I never thought about how I could use the same concept to improve my writing life, though. Here are Pereira’s exact words on the subject:\n\nWith the “spin your wheels” approach, you try different techniques at random, you don’t track the outcomes, and then you make decisions based on a gut feeling. This method is fine if you have plenty of time on your hands and don’t care about getting results. For writers operating in the real world, I recommend iteration.\n\nThis approach to writing was inspired by the entrepreneurial model used in Silicon Valley and described by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup. In a lean start-up environment, developers create a minimal viable product (MVP) and then test and tweak it in cycles to produce the best version possible. As a writer, you can operate in the same way, testing and improving your process over time to become more productive and better at your craft. The key is to build that meta-component into your writing so that you don’t just scrutinize the words you put on the page but also take time to step back and examine your process overall.\n\nI plan on using this approach in the future with my writing life. Feedback from a single walk informed how I should do my walks and propelled me to relaunch an already archived newsletter. This process works! But it relies on noticing and being mindful of useful feedback. Then, as Pereira advises, perform mini-experiments by keeping all other variables constant and testing a single input. For example, moving forward, I am thinking about changing my Lilim publication schedule from weekly to biweekly in response to feedback. I notice that I have become too product-oriented since relaunching Lilim. I spend a lot of time writing, revising, and formatting essays and the quality of my thoughts has noticeably decreased. The weekly publishing schedule also conflicts when I am about to write this newsletter you are reading, which is longer and takes more time to accomplish. So, with all else constant, I will try a bi-weekly schedule this June and see if this improves my writing life. I will update you next month.\n\n![A biker crossing the bridge](uman/images/005/biker-on-bridge.jpeg)\n\n## The Los Baños Internment Camp and a Lesson on Kindness\n\nDuring this intentional improvement of my writing and walking life, I came to a serendipitous find. I have lived in Los Baños for over a year but know almost nothing about its local history. From a conversation I once had with a friend, I learned that it was once a hospital town. I compared this to Baguio’s history as a colonial hill station, a place where worn-down Caucasian men went to rejuvenate their life energies back during the American occupation. Los Baños is similarly colder. It is nearer nature, has a state university, and a respectable ex-pat community. Was it an important American colonial territory? How important? I don’t know, so I wanted to find out.\n\nI am fully aware of how reading about the history of a place almost immediately transforms our relationship with it. When I read Cortes’ claim that the area between Manaoag and my hometown of San Jacinto in Pangasinan was once a thick jungle where bandits and outlaws used to hide, I never saw my hometown the same way again. I would ride my bike around and couldn’t help to think about that jungle she wrote about. We have trees in San Jacinto but no wilderness; everything was converted into agricultural land. I love my rice fields, but rice is nothing to trees. How I wish I saw those trees. I wanted to be surprised the same way. These surprises deepen our appreciation of place and our relationship with it. I was ready to level up my relationship with Los Baños. And the best way to do that is to go to the library.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t easy to get hold of local history in Los Baños, though. You need access to books, obviously, and with the pandemic, going to the UPLB library is not without friction. I went the first time only to find out that I needed to book a chair online. I did that first, got approved, and returned the following day. While at the Filipiniana section, I was prohibited from searching for any book by myself. Instead, the librarian asked me for a specific title, something I didn’t have because the library’s online website was broken, and I couldn’t search for books there beforehand. So, I just asked the librarian to give me any books they have on Los Baños’ local history. He gave me three books, all of which covered a single story: the rescue of prisoners in the Los Baños Internment Camp.\n\nI picked up the first one, _The Los Baños Raid_ by E. M. Flanagan, and read the first two chapters, which described the camp, how it started, and where it was located. I was surprised to learn that the half of Freedom Park from outside Baker’s Hall until the Fertility Tree and that area along Animal Husbandry, Copeland Gym, and some parts of Viado Street were once part of an internment camp for Western or Caucasian foreigners imprisoned during the Japanese occupation. More than a thousand prisoners were in that camp; many starved to death from 1942 until the remaining were rescued by American forces in 1945. According to Jeff, my friend who is a history professor at UPLB, the liberation of the internees was successful. However, it led to the massacre of Filipino residents living near the campus by the Japanese. My reading hasn’t gotten that far yet, although I would say that this was an expected reaction from the Japanese. It is typical for wartime Japanese soldiers to violently channel their anger toward prisoners and their colonies whenever they faced a defeat.\n\n![Map of the Los Baños internment camp](/uman/images/005/LB-internment-camp-map.jpeg \"Map of the Los Baños internment camp\")\n\nI took a picture of the map of the internment camp and, after leaving the library, walked these parts of the campus to trace the map and figure out what current markers could correspond to those indicated in it. I have repeatedly walked on these parts for more than a year, but they never meant that much to me until I read the stories inside that camp. Soon, I’ll be writing an essay about the camp and my attempt to trace it on that afternoon walk. But for now, I wanted to highlight the most important message I took home after reading about the life inside the internment camp. “When our freedom is crippled, we should respond with kindness.”\n\nThis lesson is best exemplified by an account of one Mrs. Nash:\n\n\u003e As the fall of 1944 approached, my breast milk was failing, and were all developing the stiff, aching joints of beriberi. Death lurked close now. Roy, his head pathetically larger for his shrunken little body, had scarcely enough energy left to cry. They boys, slumping against the barracks wall for support, talked weakly and endlessly about food.\n\u003e\n\u003e By Christmas, I had all but given up hope. All real nourishment for Roy was gone. For once, not even the skipper could think of anything to say. I know now it was because he was making his big decision.\n\u003e\n\u003e The next morning I was standing wearily in the water line, Roy in one arm and clay jug in the other, when the skipper walked up and handed me a newspaper-wrapped package. “For the wee one,” he said casually. “I’ve been saving it for him.”\n\u003e\n\u003e It was a while can of powdered milk, saved from the one Red Cross shipment that had got through to us more than a year earlier. It was enough to make a gallon of strength—two gallons the way we diluted it. “No, Skipper,” I stammered. “You’ll need it yourself.”\n\u003e\n\u003e “Never touch the stuff,” he said gruffly. He looked at Roy for a long moment, then turned away. In tears I called after him, “How can I ever repay you?” Half-jokingly he called back, “Just play me ‘Danny Boy’ at your next concert.”\n\u003e\n\u003e On New Year’s Day I made a last feeble effort at giving a recital. Skipper didn’t show up to take the front-row camp chair I had reserved for him. Omitting encores, I rushed to the infirmary—too late. Hugh Williams was gone. The prison doctor said he died from acute colitis. “An all-milk diet might have saved him,” he added.\n\nThis bead of kindness that dripped out from that internment camp while evil happened inside and around it still floods the campus and overflows out into the streets of Los Baños, decades after the liberation of the internees.\n\nEarly this month, after meeting two friends at _Haraya_, I saw that woman once again who single-handedly feeds all the stray cats at Batong Malake. I see her all the time whenever I start walking by 5 pm. I was always curious about her but always felt shy to approach her. After telling my friends about her, one of my friends said we should approach her, so we introduced ourselves. We learned that her name was Ate Nadia (if my memory does not fail me). When asked whether she is part of an organization, she said no; she was doing this all by herself, buying cat food using her money, which she earns from an entire day’s work as a housekeeper. Every so often, there are too many cats to feed that her wage isn’t enough. When this happens, she asks for a favor from the nearby pet food vendor and borrows some pet food. When asked whether she has cats at home, she said a lot! She rescues some really young and vulnerable ones and brings them home where she can help them grow or get better.\n\nWe were all awestruck after hearing this. Here’s a woman—thin, poor, and old—who makes way less money than all of us and yet tirelessly walks the streets of Batong Malake every single afternoon to do what no one else wants to do—to feed the hungry ones. But I was not entirely surprised. I have seen this before. Not long ago, while walking along Cubao, I saw a boy feeding a family of stray cats: a mother and a few tiny kittens. The child was also living on the streets, and the food he provided perhaps came from the same food a kind passerby may have given him. Why does kindness arise from places that we least expect it to appear? These outliers break Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. They transcend themselves, they forget themselves in the service of others, and they amazingly do so while they are still hungry, unsecured, and unhealthy.\n\n![Poor boy feeds cats](/uman/images/005/poor-boy-feeds-cats.jpeg)\n\n## “Thank You for Visiting Me”\n\nI mentioned above that trial and error is an effective way of finding strategies of living that work for us. But kindness, I find, is something that works all the time. You don’t need trials and error to know that it is effective. Among all the strategies of living, showing kindness is the most enduring. Another meeting with a stranger this month validated this for me. It showed me that at the end of it all, nothing matters but the kindness we receive from others.\n\nOne afternoon during my second trip to Lopez, Quezon, we visited one of the patriarchs of Sta. Teresa—one Lolo Aldo. He was a Pangasinense like me, and my companions thought it would be nice for Lolo Aldo, now in his 90s, to speak with someone who speaks his childhood language again. Lolo Aldo lives in his house near the fishponds that now belong to his son, who lives with him temporarily, that is until he is gone. We all went to see the patriarch, but not everyone stayed long. His room was too small, and urine stench filled the air—that stench which seemed to say, “I can no longer control my body. I am losing control, and there is nothing, absolutely nothing, I can do about it.”\n\nThe windows were open. They were large windows, and outside, the fishponds sat in silence while the hills behind them watched. The patriarch talked very softly, so I had to come closer. “From where were you in Pangasinan?” I asked him. “Maasin,” he said. I remembered that Maasin was also a railroad barangay in Mangaldan, Pangasinan, much like Sta. Teresa, where he currently lives. Perhaps as a young man, he would ride the train just outside his house at Maasin, travel for an entire day or two, then get off at Sta. Teresa, where he would engage with whatever his trade was and eventually build a family there. We talked a lot about many things, but two things struck me. First, when asked what food he would like us to cook for him, he said nothing. Silent, he doesn’t seem to care. What goes in his mouth doesn’t seem to matter anymore. He has reached that point in one’s life where the taste of food is completely irrelevant, and food is no longer for pleasure but a tool to sustain one’s life force. Second, after trying and failing to ask him what food he wanted, he uttered these words, which I will never forget.\n\n“It is near. I can feel it. It is near. The end is near for me. But thank you so much for remembering me. Thank you for visiting. I am tired. I will now get back to sleep.”\n\nThey helped him back to his pillow, and we all left the room.\n\n![A fishpond at Lopez, Quezon](/uman/images/005/Lolo-Aldo-fishpond.jpeg \"A view of Lolo Aldo's fishpond at Sta.

    "content": "\n![Mt. Banahaw from Calauan](/uman/images/006/mt-banahaw-calauan.jpg)\n\nI wasn’t ready, but I did it anyway. The agony of not doing it, of keeping it as an unticked box in my list of goals, which was already a carryover of last year, was stronger than the agony of possible failure.\n\nLast June 9, 2022, I walked 14 miles (22.53 km) from my house in Los Baños to San Pablo City in Laguna, Philippines. I did it in almost exactly five hours. The night before the walk, I slept only four hours. I tried to sleep more than this, but I just couldn’t. I felt like a fly lost in a cocktail of anxiety, fear, and uncertainty. I was frightened of what the following day held. Earlier that night, I announced my intention to walk to a few close friends. I was still ashamed to tell the world about the walk, but I badly needed encouragement from people who care. I just had to tell someone, anyone, whom I felt safe with. “Just do it. Enjoy the walk,” my friends said. But even with their kind words of support, I still felt like a fake. I never felt that much resistance to something that was so natural to me. Why would I be afraid of something as trivial as walking?\n\nIn hindsight, I know now that what I did wasn’t trivial at all. It was just a walk, yes, but it was a 14-mile walk. No one I know of personally in my family and in my circle of friends has done such a thing. I didn’t have someone I know of whom I can model what I was about to do then. I have Thoreau and Craig Mod to inspire me. But they come from entirely different contexts. They were white men who were capable of conquering the world through a walk. What I needed then was an inspiration from somewhere familiar, from within the Philippines—someone who has walked what I was about to walk and someone who has fairly the same motivations. However, I haven’t found any, at least not yet. Most of my friends hike mountains, some even do it for days. But I am yet to meet someone in person who has walked a few hours, days even, traversing multiple towns. It was something ancient people did in these islands, definitely, but not something anyone perfectly sane would do in a time of traffic. The futility of walking 14 miles in five hours even became clearer to me when I rode the jeep home and arrive back at Los Baños in just about 40 minutes. I have never ridden a jeep and feel so surreal before.\n\nGoing through all of those difficult emotions, no wonder I postponed doing the walk many times in the past year. But on June 8, the day before the walk, I checked the weather forecast and saw that after two days, the rains are coming to Laguna. If I am going to do this, I told myself, I should do it now. I looked at the map of Laguna and chose a destination. I needed somewhere worthy of arriving at, somewhere I could pass by several towns before arriving, and somewhere I could arrive in about half a day. San Pablo was an easy choice. It was a big city, it has seven lakes to visit, and walking towards it would require me to pass by the towns of Bay and Calauan. I was still terrified of the thought of going somewhere I have never been to on foot. But on the morning of June 9, Thursday, when the sun was already up in the sky, I opened the door and started walking, one step at a time.\n\nI am glad that I did. That long walk, my first of what I am hoping to be many, taught me important lessons about what I want to do with [[uman/004|weeks left]] in my life.\n\n![A tile store at Bay, Laguna](/uman/images/006/bay-tile.jpg)\n\n## What the Walk Taught Me About Photography\n\nBy forcing myself to do the walk, I naturally shifted my attention this month to one of my primary interests: photography. Since the walk will take a lot of time and energy, I would like to take the most advantage of it by taking the best photos I can get. My problem, though, was that I had limited photography training.\n\nLast year, [I met Craig Mod’s work serendipitously](https://vinceimbat.com/good-art-reorganizes/). His [newsletters](https://craigmod.com/newsletters/), all of which I am subscribed to, planted the seeds in my mind of the possibility of not just being a writer but being a writer-photographer. Before last year, I was already taking some decent photos on my phone for many years. I seldom used stock photography on my blog posts; I took them myself on my walks. However, I had very unsophisticated knowledge of what makes a good photograph. I knew the rule of thirds and how to use basic Snapseed editing. But that was it. Seeing Craig’s work and feeling moved by it inspired me to dive deeper into photography.\n\nI took one course on iPhone photography. Mobile photography was what made sense to me at that time. I reasoned that I was not ready to invest in an expensive camera if I didn’t even know how to use what I currently have. I was not yet sure I wanted to pursue photography, so I used my iPhone Pro 11 Max while exploring the medium. After spending about a month learning, my photography improved, and I started getting good feedback from newsletter readers and friends I volunteered to photograph. I continued tinkering with the interest, but like all my interests, I decided to park photography to focus on other interests that felt more natural, mainly writing and philosophy. I was primarily a writer and a thinker, and I wasn’t yet particularly satisfied with my skills in either, so why would I spend more time on a new skill? I told myself.\n\nHowever, planning the walk from Los Baños to San Pablo forced me to return to photography. Before and during the walk, I started studying editing more. I discovered Lightroom mobile and started taking photos through its mobile camera app, so I can take RAW images and not just the JPEG photos that the iPhone’s native camera app produces. I still didn’t have a pro camera. I still didn’t feel the need to have one before and during the walk. But after learning to edit and taking more photos, I slowly realized how much a professional camera could produce better photo quality. Because of this walk, I think I am already in a position where my skills and desire to learn warrant investing in a beginner pro camera.\n\nMore importantly, this month’s deep dive into photography made me see an important fact. I saw how too technical photography can be and how easy it is to drown in this technicality without accomplishing any good work. A budding photographer can easily drown in the concepts, techniques, and facts associated with this field that it is so easy to forget why one is taking photos in the first place. The science of photography can easily out-power the art. To tackle both issues, I decided to pause my learning and do a meta-learning project to create a personalized curriculum for self-studying photography. I wanted to find the best resources to teach myself the basics, then move immediately to learning the works of photographers that I resonate with, so I can start honing my photographic voice.\n\nThe two biggest questions I had about photography during and after the walk were: What subject will I photograph in my walks? And what stories do I want to tell through my photographs? I noticed that street and travel photographers almost always have some rough idea of what to look for even before their walks. They still allow the stories to arise organically during the walk, but they have a rough idea that guides their photography throughout the walk. For example, Alec Soth portraits people, while Craig Mod shots artifacts of domestic life (e.g., laundry). Both their approach is anthropological. They intend to learn about the place, the people, and the culture of where they are walking. I would realize later that, even if I find this kind of work inspiring, it may not be the best kind of photography that suits my personality.\n\nHowever, these questions about the subject and the story that my photographs ought to convey combined with another question that came to me when blisters were forming on the soles of my feet and my legs were burning from the heat: [[Lilim 29 - Why Walk?|\"Why walk?\"]]\n\n![A bucket left on a raft at Sampaloc lake](/uman/images/006/bucket-on-raft.jpg)\n\n## What the Walk Taught Me About Walking\n\nIf you have been walking for three hours, the sun grilling every cell of your body, and you suddenly see that elevated highway from Calauan to San Pablo, of course, you have to ask yourself, \"Why am I doing this?\"\n\nI wish I have thought about that question way before doing the walk. I wish I had an articulate reason for doing this. But I didn't. I knew I wanted to try it, and I have been reading Thoreau and Craig Mod for long enough not to. However, when the walk gets hard, which it did for me, you will realize that doing a long walk just because your heroes did one is not enough to get you through it. During and after the walk (the entire month of June), I spent a good amount of time just thinking about what walking meant to me, what I wanted to get from it, and what I hoped to use it for.\n\nI tried articulating my initial ideas, which first came to me during a long diary session, in a recent Lilim issue ([[Lilim 29 - Why Walk?|Lilim 03(05)—Why Walk?]]). However, even after publishing that piece, I knew my thoughts about this matter were still incomplete. Since sharing that Lilim issue, I continued contemplating why I am so driven to walk.\n\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs I had while thinking about walking this month was remembering the trajectory of my relationship with walking throughout my life. As a child who grew up in a Christian evangelical household, walking was first a form of _penitence_. I did not particularly enjoy joining my parents on house-to-house walks, trying to talk to people about the bible, and sometimes experiencing ridicule from people who didn’t like what we did. When I went to college, however, I embraced the faith of my parents and made it my own. Suddenly, walking transformed from being an activity I disliked into a platform to achieve a mission I dedicated myself to. I became a young pastor very early and led a small group of sign language interpreters walking, sometimes hiking, the mountains of Baguio City and La Trinidad, Benguet, to visit the Deaf and bring them “the good news.”\n\nIn 2012, when I finally decided to renounce my childhood religion, I left the house on my bike as my parents and sisters rode in the car to attend the memorial of Christ's death. That happened one late afternoon in the summer. It was the first memorial I intentionally missed. I rode my bike and found a large mango tree under which I sat down to write. Little did I know that this started my daily late afternoon communion with Nature, which I since did through biking to a spot and walking while pulling my bike beside me. Walking became this organic reaction to that painful act of defiance, of leaving. I ran away from an established worldview only to slowly walk towards nothingness, towards a place where I can build my own worldview piece by piece from the ground up all by my own hands. Walking was leaving and approaching at the same time.\n\nAnd yet, years after 2012, I would walk the same paths that I walked as a preacher in Baguio and Pangasinan. As a different person, walking the same paths triggered memories of that past and reconnected me with who I was before as I tapped into the wisdom I seemed to have left in those trails. Surprisingly, walking the same trails made me feel good. It reminded me of what good I had back then and how I might reintegrate those into my new life without the baggage of the past. Re-walking those paths reinforced my desire to make walking an integral part of my life as a writer, poet, and photographer. Walking is reconnecting and renewal.\n\nWhile walking allows me to remember, it also allows me to forget, so I can find new ways of thinking and being. Ten years since I left the church, I still feel like I am looking for something, and the search is far from over. I continue to search for what was once passed down to me by my parents: community, purpose, and belief. Countless times over the decade, that search felt stagnant. Whenever I take a step forward, I take two steps backward. Establishing new friendships is hard. Trying out new ideas only to replace them again is hard. Many times I felt like restarting from zero. Walking while all of these were happening gave me a feeling of momentum. Even if my life wasn't moving, I always moved forward while walking. Although I am still looking for something during a walk, I do not feel the pressure to arrive, and it always feels like I am making progress. Walking reminds me to keep searching until I find what I am looking for but to do so with a lighter heart. Walking is consolation for the seeker.\n\nBut walking isn't just therapy. Perhaps the most important relationship I fostered with walking throughout the years is how I organically transformed it into the canvass where I do my work as a writer, poet, and photographer. In my past life as a preacher, walking was simply a means towards an end. I needed to walk a road that led to the house of a Deaf I would be preaching to that day. Today, walking is no longer just a means to do my work. Walking is the work itself. I can't think well and produce insight without walking. I do my best thinking and my rest from it while walking. I catch poems and practice my photography while outdoors, walking. I write field notes, which I flesh out into narratives in my journal—records that I later publish in Lilim. After the long walk to San Pablo City, I also saw firsthand the power of using a long walk to deeply experience and understand the culture, history, politics, and social dynamics of a space. If these are not enough motivations to walk, then think about all the beauty one only sees when walking, the opportunity to practice mindfulness, the health benefits, and the serendipitous meeting with strangers. After the long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo, it became clear that I was attracted to walking throughout my life because it allows me to heal, be myself, and become the person I want to be. In other words, I always saw walking as a tool for personal development.\n\nAside from these large lessons on walking, I also picked up a few practical learnings about it, which, I hope, will help me prepare for my next long walk.\n\n1. **The Philippines is not very walk-friendly.** Sidewalks are lacking. If cyclists are already struggling, how much more are walkers? This fact might be why most outdoor activities in the Philippines consist of hiking or biking. Almost no one writes about walking. In other countries, I heard you can use a service where your baggage is sent to your destination. This service frees you up with lots of weight while walking, which, based on my experience, is much needed if you want to endure the walk. Furthermore, there are no clear walking trails or routes in the Philippines. We have hiking trails but not flat walking routes. However, just because the Philippines is not as walkable as other places doesn't mean walking is impossible to do here. It just requires a bit more effort and creativity to perform a multi-day and multi-town walk.\n2. **Carry the minimum viable baggage.** Because there are no baggage services, you must be more mindful when taking a long walk in the Philippines. One of the biggest mistakes on the trek was bringing my 6-lb. MacBook Pro Mid-2012. It was the heaviest part of my baggage. I will bring a lighter laptop and fewer clothes if I do another long walk. I will take advantage of fast laundry services at my destination rather than increase my baggage's weight by bringing more clothes. Because the Philippines is not walkable, I am unsure whether a multi-week-long walk is logistically possible. This problem is something I need to think more about. Again, I don't have a model to follow, so I am discovering this all on my own.\n3. **No social media during the walk.** Once on the walk, you get excited (or perhaps bored and alone) that it is almost natural to bring out your phone, document it live, and share it immediately. Early on my walk, this is what I did. I posted an announcement via Facebook that I was doing a long walk, and I will be posting live updates (that's right, when you are on the walk and excited, all your fears the other night vanishes). It was like a way for me to write field notes, although in front of an audience. While I am grateful for the comments I received in that post, which contained recommendations for places to visit and kind encouragement, I regret posting the updates live. Doing so took my mind away from the walk itself and made the walk feel very performative. Next time, I might do daily updates via social media or, better yet, implement a pop-up newsletter as my heroes do.\n4. **Take care of your body.** I should've started the walk at dawn to avoid the Philippine heat. But since I slept late, I woke up later than I originally planned. I also prepared the morning of the walk (a bad, bad idea). I finished preparing at around 8 am, and the sun was already high. Moreover, I didn't put sunblock on my legs and feet. I also didn't know I should put some lubricant on my feet' soles to prevent blisters. Midway through the walk, my feet started having them, and they hurt until I got home to Los Baños the following day.\n\n![A dog walks over a platform at Sampaloc lake](/uman/images/006/dog-by-lake.jpg)\n\n## What the Walk Taught Me About Writing\n\nAlthough the long walk forced me to strengthen my photography skills and uncover my motivations for walking, I realized that photography and walking alone are insufficient in creating the most important element in this process: meaning.\n\nAfter the walk, with numerous photos, field notes, and memories in hand, the question remained: What will I do with all of these? Thinking about this question reminded me that my walks and photos will be more meaningful if I am more intentional about them—if I use them to deepen my sense of meaning.\n\nLiving is living. As is, it is mundane. What I was hoping to get from my walks is a connection with the ordinary, the real stuff of life, but also a connection that was more than this. I wanted to see and touch and experience but also elevate all these by transforming them into an artifact that deepens my sense of meaning. I wanted the artifact and the process of creating it to contribute to this meaning-making. There is no better way to do that, at least for me, than to contemplate on it, savor it, think about it, and while doing all of this, write about it. Because writing is the best facilitator I know for meaning-making.\n\nThis meaning-making process, I realized, starts by taking good field notes. I take mine using Drafts, a writing app on my phone that lets me quickly capture any thought or observation that comes to me during a walk. I learned recently that Craig Mod takes notes via audio recording instead. While walking, he talks over his phone and records things as he notices them. For outsiders, he is simply on a call. I tried doing this recently, and although it feels weird at first, it definitely is more convenient.\n\nBut this meaning-making process will only succeed once we return to those notes and flesh them out into longer narratives. We can start by handwriting the initial narrative in our journal before transferring it to a digital form where it is easier to play around with. Narrative writing forces one to find general, abstract interconnections between what would rather be disparate events and facts. A story has a strong psychological, almost therapeutic, effect on the storyteller as it organizes and naturally interprets chaos. I am not inherently good at narrative writing, so I am doing my best to improve it and incorporate it more and more into my writing. I did that last month, although not with the same intensity I put on photography, by transcribing and editing several narratives I wrote in the past into my Talahardin. I also practiced copying [Ben Hewitt’s vignette writing style](https://benhewitt.net/2022/06/07/it-does-feel-good/) and using that to write [[Lilim 30 - Where Grass Once Turned Crimson|Lilim 03(06)—Where Grass Once Turned Crimson]].\n\nBut perhaps the best investment I made last month on improving my narrative writing and meaning-making, in general, was ordering the third edition of [_Kissa by Kissa_](https://shop.specialprojects.jp/products/kissa-by-kissa-3rd-ed) by Craig Mod and reading it in two sittings over coffee and cake. Reading _Kissa by Kissa_ showed me what is possible by walking. Opening the book and reading the first few chapters convinced me instantly that I wanted to create something like it. I wanted to be a walker, photographer, and writer all in one. Whatever doubts I had about these three identities merging into one vanished. The visceral experience of immersing myself in such a beautiful object showed me what is possible in my life work for the years to come. But reading the book also informed me of the kind of writing I want to pursue.\n\n![Craig Mod's Kissa by Kissa (3rd ed.)](/uman/images/006/kissa-by-kissa.jpg)\n\n_Kissa by Kissa_ is an anthropological piece of art. It concerns itself more with place, people, history, and culture. While this excites and inspires me, I distrust myself to create something like it. I feel like I am less courageous than Craig Mod in engaging in conversations with strangers. I try my best to greet strangers along the way and talk to them as much as possible, but not in a way that will produce the stories to write a book like those in _Kissa by Kissa_. I need to accept who I am: both my strengths and weaknesses. My strength as a writer is finding insights and beauty during walks and sharing them as best as possible. This strength entails that the kind of writing I think I could and want to write is in the tradition of Thoreau and Dillard—walking or walking-inspired poetic prose that combines narrative with palatable philosophical language. And by philosophy, I only mean grappling with the question, “How to live?” This writing is the kind of writing I think I want to focus on moving forward—writing centered on the human quest to learn how to live better with the outdoors as its backdrop.\n\nOf course, I also create meaning through photography. But with photography, it is a bit more challenging. It is difficult to be more intentional with the images one captures since most images pop out along the way. However, being clear about the _kind_ of images, not necessarily the exact pictures I want to take, definitely assures that my photos are more deliberate and interconnected. Moving forward, I want my photographs to be repositories of meaning. They would be an extension of text, although I am also open for them to dictate the path that text follows.\n\n![A mural at the Sampaloc lake baywalk](/uman/images/006/san-pabluy.jpg)\n\n## What the Walk Taught Me About Living\n\nThe [[About me|core of what I do with my life]] is to cultivate a rich inner life by learning to be alone well through a combination of experience in the real world, in space, and deep thought. In other words, walking + writing. These two are not the only fundamental parts of the life I want to live. But they make up the engine that drives this life. The gamble I am taking is that through investing about 80–90% of my efforts in the solitude that walking and writing necessitates—that is, in cultivating an unquenchable passion for this inner life through a self-directed pseudo-monastic practice—everything else falls into place. I put faith in the ability of walking + writing to nurture the virtues I want to embody as I go out and show up in the real world: deep understanding, moderation, humility, modesty, joy, and perhaps, most important of all, compassion. Given my knowledge of who I am, I don’t know if I can reverse this process. I couldn’t build a public image first a let that trickle down into my private self. It just wouldn’t work for me.\n\nIf anything enduring came from my first long walk from Los Baños to Laguna, that is the cementing of this prioritization of inner life into my psyche. The long walk and the pain that went with it made me realize how much I am committed to the inner world that I am willing to be out in a less comfortable situation just so I can be totally in here. Publishing Uman and Lilim is important. Talking to my readers is important. Going out and meeting new people is important. Being around family and friends is important. But none is as important as doing the core of the work: enriching my inner life through walking and writing.\n\nIn _Kissa by Kissa_ Craig Mod reveals that his desire to look for and learn about the _kissas_ of Japan and the pizza toast that come with them was inspired by his experience as an adopted child, relocating to a foreign country, and not feeling any sense of belongingness. The _kissa_ became his haven in Japan, and the pizza toast his comfort food. After reading this, I asked myself whether I have a similar organic relationship with walking. What was my _kissa_? What was my pizza toast? What draws me towards walks, no matter how short they are? What I learned surprised me.\n\nI am naturally drawn towards [[Lilim 26 - All Them Dirt Roads|dirt roads]]—underdeveloped roads that link main roads and highways to farms. These are the only real walking routes in the flat Philippines—accessible to most Filipinos living in the provinces and their suburbs. These dirt roads were where I walked most of my life, where most of my thoughts, photographs, and poems came to me. It is there where I mended my broken heart, broken psyche, and broken soul throughout my young life. Unlike Craig, I am not drawn toward a specific object but all things in my safe space. And throughout all the walks I took in my 30 years of existence, my hope was always to come back home after a walk a better person, and if not better, then at least renewed so that I can go back the next day and try once more.\n\n![A blue boat among green algae](/uman/images/006/blue-boat-algae.jpg)",

    "title": "𝌡 Uman — July 2022",
    "content": "\n![Star Plaza at Dagupan](/uman/images/007/star-plaza.JPG)\n\nIt is doubtful that you are waiting for 𝌡 Uman's arrival. But if you were, I apologize. I went through a lot in the past three weeks, forcing me to rethink how I write and share online.\n\n***\n\nI have decided to simplify (again) my newsletter writing system, so I can focus on tending [[thoughts/forest garden of the mind]]. Moving forward, I am implementing the following changes:\n\n- My other newsletter, [Lilim](tags/lilim), will be integrated into [Uman](tags/uman). This means that all future Lilim issues will be linked to Uman. Managing one newsletter is more straightforward than two.\n- Uman will continue to be sent monthly but in a simpler format. Instead of spending four days and more piecing together a narrative of my past month, I will be using Uman to share links to changes I made to my [website](https://vinceimbat.com/), which mainly include writing progress I have made in my forest garden. I'll be linking to notes about what I am referring to as my \"forest garden of the mind\" in the next Uman issue, but for now, you can go around my [website](https://vinceimbat.com/) and poke around its design to get an idea of what I am talking about.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's get right into the July issue of Uman. Uman, the Pangasinan word for \"change,\" documents the monthly changes I go through as I walk [[The long walk|The long walk]] of life. It serves as a cairn to the journey, marking where I have been in both geographic and intellectual excursions for an entire month.\n\nHere is July 2022's cairn.\n\n## Philosophical and other studies\n\n### Thoreau\n\nI reviewed and improved my notes on [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]]. I studied and thought about Thoreau for a good chunk of July 2022. I researched his choice of literary medium: the [[Romantic excursion|romantic excursion]], and read about his quest to live his unique version of [[Transcendentalism]] and how this organized his various interests. I also continued reading *[[thoughts/walden by thoreau|Walden]]*.\n\nBut the most crucial step I took with my relationship with Thoreau this month was learning about [[The philosophical stance of Thoreau|Thoreau's philosophical stance]] after reading the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on him](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thoreau/). It showed me how different I am from him philosophically, which was mind-blowing and depressing at the same time.\n\n### The Quest\n\nReading about Thoreau's quest inspired me to think about my own. I journaled about and published an initial note on my forest garden: [[thoughts/my quest]].\n\n### Philosophy is the core of my work\n\nPhilosophy is still my main work. The most critical work is studying and living (writing is already part of studying). Sharing is writing for others, which is not necessarily the point. The core of my work does not involve others—just myself.\n\nI reaffirmed that [[The writing I do in private is my most important writing|the writing I do in private is the most important writing]] I do, which I partly learned from Thoreau. [[Thoreau prioritized content over style in his writing]], and [[The magnum opus of Thoreau is his journal|his journal was his magnum opus]].\n\n### Lyrical philosophy\n\nBut if philosophy was my main work, what kind of philosophizing and philosophical writing am I attracted to?\n\nI started reading *[Lost Intimacy in American Thought](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7035186-lost-intimacy-in-american-thought)* by Edward Mooney. It is an interesting book whose thesis is that there is a circle of philosophers who \"beheld\" reality rather than \"theorize\" about it. They put themselves in the middle of reality rather than detach themselves from it. These are philosophers who I have never heard of but are associated with Thoreau by their methods and style. The form of philosophy they wrote can be described as [[thoughts/lyrical philosophy|lyrical philosophy]]. To learn more about this philosophy, I read the journal article [[Lyrical Philosophy, or How to Sing with Mind — Epstein|\"Lyrical Philosophy or How to Sing with Mind\"]] by Mikhail Epstein and Mooney's definition of lyrical philosophy in his [blog](https://edmooneyblog.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/lyrical-philosophy/).\n\nI particularly enjoyed Mooney's lyrical writing, although it can be cryptic sometimes. I checked if he has a blog. [He does](https://edmooneyblog.wordpress.com/), although he no longer updates it. Through Mooney, I discovered [[thoughts/henry bugbee]] and his lyrical, philosophical work *[[thoughts/the inward morning by bugbee|The Inward Morning]]*. I am currently studying it and finding inspiration from how he did philosophy. I also journaled about [[The philosophical method of Henry Bugbee|Henry Bugbee's philosophical method]] and how they relate to the fact that \"[[We learn to live while we are living]].\" Lastly, Bugbee's vision helped me rearticulate my purpose: [[thoughts/my purpose is to live deliberately]].\n\n### Ordinary language philosophy\n\nI also explored [[Ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language philosophy]], which was a reaction to the attempt by [[Bertrand Russell]] and the like to create a specialized language for philosophers based on logic. They argued that words and concepts could not be understood in isolation but in how they are used in everyday life. [[thoughts/ludwig wittgenstein]] was one, if not the most influential proponent of ordinary language philosophy. To explore Wittgenstein, I read a few chapters from the book [Wittgenstein's Artillery](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55871660-wittgenstein-s-artillery).\n\n### Ideas on experimenting with lyrical philosophy\n\nI asked myself: [[How can I combine truth and beauty in one philosophical practice?]] And I wrote what I wanted to create: artifacts of writing around universal subject matters, which are place-based and use the romantic excursion as their device.\n\nI then listed some [[Ideas on how to explore lyrical philosophy in my work|ideas on how I could explore and create these forms of philosophy in my work]]. Thinking about lyrical philosophy made me ask about [[Emotions|emotions]] and their difference from feelings. The more I think about it, the more I see that philosophy sprouts out of the same tree that poetry comes from: wonder. I journaled about this similarity: [[Poetry and narrative trace their history so readers can re-enact them]].\n\n### Photography and philosophy\n\nPhilosophy and photography can be complementary. The only time photography becomes disconnected from philosophy is if philosophy continues to become this academic intellectual theory-only exercise.\n\nBut photography takes on a different function if I take philosophy as a way to deepen life through both happiness and meaning. It becomes integral to the philosophical practice by the following examples:\n\n- I take a philosophical thought and look for a photo to represent it.\n- I use photography and walking to deepen my relationship with place and Nature.\n- I use photography to elevate moments as I do with poetry.\n\n## Writing\n\nOne of my goals last July was to try to get published somewhere. I am not doing this to \"build a portfolio\" or anything. I am simply curious about the process. I edited, rewrote, and translated some Pangasinan poems, which I then sent to an [online journal](https://tldtd.org/). My friend Rem provided some much-needed feedback on the verses. Preparing the poems and communicating with the editors was very instructional.\n\n## Photography\n\nI used Kaufman's ideas from *[[The First 20 Hours — Kaufman|The First 20 Hours]]* to identify the minimum viable steps I need to take to learn photography. The result: I was able to finalize [[My photography learning roadmap|my photography learning roadmap]]. By the way, I finally invested in an entry-level pro camera. I'm currently slowing down with learning photography, but I will jump right into the camera once I feel the photography itch again.\n\n## Walking\n\nI started reading Teju Cole's beautiful debut novel *[Open City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8526694-open-city)*, a meditative collection of vignettes told from the perspective of one walker. I also read the first chapter or a few of Martin Bunzl's *[Thinking While Walking](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58017939-thinking-while-walking)*. This book was written by a professional philosopher who used walking the Pacific Crest Trail to prompt him to philosophize. The general structure of the book was a narrative. Bunzl tackled one problem for every trail station, all ten of them. But the style of writing was academic philosophy and wasn't very lyrical.\n\nIn July, I published a couple of Lilim issues:\n- [[Lilim 30 - Where Grass Once Turned Crimson]]\n- [[Lilim 31 - Walking Lopez, Quezon Part I The Rules of Trolleys]]\n\nIn my journal, I wrote about what is most important to me during walks ([[Connection with space, object, or scene is the most important part of my walk]]) and how I might be better off doing short philosophical walks in a specific place for an extended period rather than long walks.\n\n## Projects\n\n### Reviewing and resetting goals\n\nLastly, I read James Clear's web page on [goal-setting](https://jamesclear.com/goal-setting) and took some notes on Zotero. Then I read his article on [Warren Buffet's list](https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus). I pondered about the process and thought about how I could integrate it with my annual and monthly reviews. I applied the process, and it made it clear that my most significant projects in the coming months pertain to clarifying [[My life plan|my life work]].\n\nI created a few new notes to facilitate my thinking on this goal-setting process.\n- [[warren buffet list]]\n- [[How to set goals]]\n- [[Avoid-at-all cost life goals]]",

    "title": "𝌡 Uman — August 2022",
    "content": "\n![Scarlet flower](/uman/images/008/scarlet_flower.jpg)\n\n𝌡 Uman is a monthly newsletter about documenting what it means to pursue philosophy, contemplation, and writing independently as a way of life.\n\nIn this August 2022 issue:\n- Henry Bugbee and his philosophy of place, presence, and memory\n- Leaving academia\n- Andrew J. Brown and unitarianism\n- What the words \"religion\" and \"spirituality\" mean\n- A forest garden of the mind\n- Some new walking vignettes\n- Why freelancing and entrepreneurship might be more secure than a traditional job\n***\n\nAugust was was a weird month. I started it by experimenting with work schedule. I combined two working-for-money sessions that ran from July 26 to August 6. Usually, I would work four to five straight 12+ hour work days during the last five days of each month. This frees up the next 25 days of the following month for philosophy, walking, and photography. I wrote about how I got into this lifestyle in a badly titled essay I wrote a few years back: \"[[How I Became a Professional Multipotentialite]].\"\n\nI was curious what would working for ten straight 12+ hour work days in exchange for 50 free soulful days felt like, so I tried. I might never do it again. After 120+ work hours in a span of ten days, I went home immediately to Pangasinan to spend time with some relatives coming home from the States for the first time since the pandemic. There, in between family bonding, I spent my time exploring a few new thinkers and a completely different way of writing and publishing online, which I have been exposed to in the past but never really embraced until now: [[Digital gardening]].\n\n## Philosophical and other studies\n\n### Henry Bugbee\n\nI discovered [[thoughts/henry bugbee]] through his prolific student [[thoughts/edward mooney]], while reading about [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]] last month. The two Henries were similar as they both wrote works that could be classified as [[thoughts/lyrical philosophy]], that is, philosophical texts that were written sans the rigid and dry language of most analytical philosophy but instead using literary techniques like narrative and verse. They are called lyrical because the use of the first person \"I\" is integral in this kind of philosophy. The experiences and point of view of the author is seminal in the work. It is a kind of philosophy I am playing around in the past couple of months. In fact, I already have some [[Ideas on how to explore lyrical philosophy in my work]]. Specifically, I would like to [[Combine analytical and lyrical philosophy in one practice]].\n\nBugbee, like Thoreau, wrote relatively little and published even less. In fact, while Thoreau only published two books, Bugbee only published one—*[[thoughts/the inward morning by bugbee|The Inward Morning: A Philosophical Exploration in Journal Form]]*. It is a beautiful piece of writing, one that eludes simple description. I have only started to read its first 50 pages but I have to say it is a mix of deep, difficult prose and poetic, even entertaining stories. Lyrical, indeed. If you are curious, I started publishing [[my commentaries on the inward morning by bugbee]].\n\nSince he is not a structured thinker, Bugbee can be difficult to understand. To help me \"get\" him, I read two excellent essays: [\"Henry Bugbee: Thinker, Wanderer, Fly-fisherman\"](https://www.athwart.org/thinker-wanderer-fly-fisherman-the-life-and-thought-of-henry-bugbee/) by Joseph Keegin and [Working Certainty and Deweyan Wisdom](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9780823285129-007/html) by Douglas Anderson. The introduction of his book written by his mentor [[Gabriel Marcel]] also helped as well as a [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/henry-bugbee-education-and-the-style-of-our-lives/id1566642840?i=1000556517541) about his essay \"Education and the Style of Our Lives.\"\n\nBugbee believes that philosophy, like poetry, should flow, and therefore, the philospher should follow a poetic principle in writing:\n\n\u003eGet it down. Get down so far as possible the minute inflections of day to day thought. Get down the key ideas as they occur. Don't worry about what it will add up to. Don't worry about whether it will come to something finished. Don't give it up when faced with the evidence of miscarried thought. Write on, not over again. Let it flow. Don't haggle with the naturalists. Don't be stopping to jam the idea down somebody's throat. Give it a chance. If there can be concrete philosophy, give it a chance. Let one perception move instantly on another. Where they come from is to be trusted. Unless this is so, after all is said and done, philosophy is arbitrary and idle.\n\nHis epistemology inspired me to treat the field notes I write during my walks and the fleeting notes I take while reading as integral parts of my philosophical universe. Before, I treated them as inputs to be processed and later on deleted. This August, I created a separate tag in my Obsidian vault that marked them as \"seeds\"—seeds that need planting somewhere in my forest garden of the mind.\n\nHere are two seeds I was particularly fond of in August—both of them taken during a walk:\n\n- [[2022-08-09 seeds]]\n- [[2022-08-18 seeds]]\n\n### Leaving academia\n\nI have always been interested in intellectual work happening outside academia. In August, I found some resources about people who were once deep inside academia and now were out. They shared the reasons why they left and a few options about what to do next for people who left the ivory tower.\n\nHere are those resources:\n\n- [The Professor is In](https://theprofessorisin.com/)\n- [Roostervane](https://theprofessorisin.com/)\n- [Why I Left Academia, And What Happened In My First Three Years | Chris Cornthwaite - Roostervane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYWTNhtU-SI \"Why I Left Academia, And What Happened In My First Three Years | Chris Cornthwaite - Roostervane\")\n- [Academia is a cult | Karen Kelsky | TEDxUAMonticello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghAhEBH3MDw \"Academia is a cult | Karen Kelsky | TEDxUAMonticello\")\n- [Get your mind off the conveyor belt with Steve Patterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zOs0OVrpo \"Get your mind off the conveyor belt with Steve Patterson\")\n- [Career Hackers](https://careerhackers.com/top-communities/)\n\n### Andrew J. Brown and unitarianism\n\nWhile looking for secondary resources to help me understand Henry Bugbee's *The Inward Morning*, I came across an article entitled [Henry Bugbee - an atheistic mysticism free of mythological trappings](http://andrewjbrown.blogspot.com/2014/06/henry-bugbee-atheistic-mysticism-free.html?m=1). It was an article posted on a very interesting website. Interesting because it was owned (and regularly updated!) by a church minister who was also an atheist! To show you how interesting this person is, I'll just paste his bio here:\n\n\u003eMy name is Andrew James Brown. I’m a philosophically/theologically inclined writer with sympathies towards Christian atheism, D. G. Leahy’s “thinking now occurring for the first time”, a Lucretian inspired religious naturalism, new materialism and Kyoto School philosophy; also a photographer, cyclist, walker and jazz bass player. In addition to this, I’m the minister of a small, liberal-religious, free-thinking community in Cambridge (UK).\n\nHe got me at \"philosophically/theologically inclined writer\" (That's me! Well, at least the first half of it) but also at Christian atheism (I had no idea something like that existed). I read Andrew's [About](https://andrewjbrown.blogspot.com/p/about-this-blog.html) page and fell in love with the twist and turns of his life that led him to where he is now. He piqued my interest on the philosopher [[Benedict Spinoza]] and I just love this quote he uses throughout his work, a quote by the philosopher [[Herbert Fingarette]]:\n\n\u003e\"These studies are outcomes rather than realised objectives. In making the journey, I have no aims. These studies are intellectual footprints, not blueprints.\"\n\nThat's exactly how I want my thinking and writing to look like or, at least, try to be. His article/sermon \"[The Freedom To Be Tomorrow What We Are Not Today](https://andrewjbrown.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-freedom-to-be-tomorrow-what-we-are.html)\" elaborated this quote.\n\nAfter reading the word [[thoughts/unitarianism]] from Andrew's bio, I immediately felt it was familiar. Ah, yes! The movie *Come Sunday*, which was about the excommunication of Carlton Pearson, a once pastor of the Higher Dimensions Family Church, because of his refusal to teach the existence of hell. After leaving his previous church, Pearson became affiliated with a unitarian church.\n\nUnitarianism, I would later learn, is one of the most liberal movements in religion, one that allowed its ministers to teach free thinking theologies, even skepticism about the existence of God. As an ex-young pastor of a fundamentalist evangelical religion, who left after realizing how stringent the rules in the church were, the spirit of unitarianism speaks a lot to me. Although I have no plans of joining any organize religion anytime soon, Andrew's work reminded me of the many possibilities in a life devoted to philosophy and contemplation.\n\n![Ducks along the canal](/uman/images/008/ducks_canal.jpg)\n\n### Religion and spirituality\n\nBugbee's only book *The Inward Morning* was described by Gabriel Marcel as a religious work. Fifty pages past since I started reading it, nothing in there came to me as religious except, perhaps, some alusions to Eastern philosophy. Was this what Marcel referred to as \"religious\"? This got me thinking: How do philosophers use the noun \"religion\" and its adjective \"religious\"? In addition, Andrew Brown mentioned [religious naturalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_naturalism) in his bio, which I immediately checked out. I read the Wikipedia entry on it. I discovered that [[Religious naturalism]] is a relatively new belief system that simply introduces religious practices, ideas, and values as a response to a sense of wonder of the natural world. Many atheists or agnostics who reject the supernatural realm but are still \"religious\" find a home in this label. To learn more about this perspective, I listened to a [podcast interview](https://podcasts.apple.com/is/podcast/022-the-sacred-depths-of-nature-w-ursula-goodenough/id1532267287?i=1000522535424) of one of the movement's founders, [[Ursula Goodenough]].\n\nAll of these led me to a rabbit hole that I should have explored long ago if I have not been intentionally avoiding the topic: religion. After I left my childhood religion, I found that it was an almost automatic reflex to reject anything that has to do with \"religion.\" Although I did have a [[The Eastern philosophy period of my intellectual life (2015–2017)|\"spiritual period\"]] a few years after leaving the church when I explored different Eastern belief systems, I never really was able to let go of the cautiousness I learned from my previous experience nor do I want to let go of it. Today, as I try to develop my own worldview, I never really looked at the current project as something \"religious.\" But reading Bugbee and encountering religious naturalism convinced me that I need to understand what religion really is and evaluate my life work through that understanding.\n\nI started my exploration by reading the entry entitled \"[The Concept of Religion](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concept-religion/index.html#ref-1)\" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I was mindblown by the plethora of options in defining religion, many of which I wasn't aware of. I assumed that the word religion *always* referred to an organized group that shared a belief in a deity or deities and whose practices and traditions involved pleasing those dieties. But the original meaning of the Greek word *religio* was far from this assumption and even more contemporary definitions reject the idea that a religion always requires a belief in a deity. If you are fascinated by this topic, like me, you can check out the notes I wrote about the theme [[Religion]].\n\nAfter reading and thinking about the many uses of the word religion, I began thinking about the possibility of having a religious element in my life work. As I have articulated in the past, I see my life work as something that revolves around finding answers to the question [[thoughts/how to live?]]. My desire to learn phiosophy and develop [[thoughts/my worldview]] and a unique way of life based on that is, I now see, a very religious endeavor. In history, such an endeavor was originally philosophical (that is, it didn't involve deities), but it was later adopted by religious people throughout history that I couldn't keep a blind eye to the lives of these great exemplars. They are rich resources for my project.\n\nI am taking baby steps towards this direction. I wrote the following notes where I considered the possibility of learning from my past life as a religious person:\n- [[Things I had in my past religious life I can incorporate in my current life]]\n- [[A comparison of my past religious life and my life today]]\n\nThinking about religion, I couldn't not think about [[spirituality]]. Not long from my research, I realized that, unlike religion, most resources about the meaning of he word spirituality are written outside academic circles by spiritual gurus from different traditions. Scholars treat spirituality as something integral to religious studies and, therefore, does not give it its own discourse. That is starting to change as some philosophers are advocating for the establishent of a new [\"philosophy of spirituality.\"](https://brill.com/view/title/37955) As currently conceptualized, spirituality seems to be closer to the concept of a \"personal religion,\" a religion that is curated by the individual practitioner using different elements from different traditions available in a \"spritual marketplace.\" Also, spirituality, as understood by psychologists, refers to the state of having spiritual experiences (or transcendental experiences), something that [[Scott Barry Kaufman]] discusses in his book *[[Transcend — Kaufman|Transcend]]*.\n\nA seed note I wrote recently ([[2022-08-30 seeds]]) captures my current thinking and dilemmas about the words \"religion\" and \"spirituality.\" My current stand is to avoid using these words in my life work, at least for now, not because they are innacurate (my work indeed has a religious and spiritual element), but because they are too loaded that I might be misinterpreted. I don't have a clear alternative. But for now, I will stick to philosophy or \"way of life\" as labels to my project.\n\n![Kubo behind tree](/uman/images/008/tree_kubo.jpg)\n\n## Writing\n\nI wrote a new Lilim issue earlier last month: [[Lilim 32 - Walking Lopez, Quezon Part II A Fishpond at San Jose|\"Lilim 03(08) — Walking Lopez, Quezon Part II: A Fishpond at San Jose\"]].\n\nIn my digital forest garden, I also published first drafts of four vignettes:\n- [[Sa harap ng lawa ng Sampaloc]]\n- [[The ube halaya stores at San Pablo]]\n- [[Ang mosque sa Bulusan Street]]\n- [[The Dirt Roads Are My Kissas]]\n\nThese drafts could become future Lilim issues. Why I am publishing \"drafts\" will be explained in the next section.\n\nLastly, I wrote a lengthy Facebook post about why [[Freelancing or Entrepreneurship is More Financially Secure Than a 9-5 Job]]. A lot of my freelancer and entrepreneur friends seem to resonate with it.\n\n## Projects\n\n### Digital Gardening\n\nAs I said in the introduction, I spent a good amount of August thinking about and applying a different way of writing on the web. Earlier this year, I intended to learn web design and development. I took a course (which I haven't finished yet!). My goal was to redesign my website from the ground up. I also wanted to launch a customized website for the hundreds of processed and unprocessed notes in my [[Personal knowledge management]] system, notes I accumulated from years of reading, writing, and reflecting.\n\nWhile researching for inspirations for the redesign, I cam across the website [100r.co](https://100r.co/site/home.html). Its authors treated the website as a personal wiki (an encyclopedia of their life while living in a boat and experimenting with a low-tech lifestyle). I became fascinated by the concept and wanted to turn my website into something similar, to distance myself from the time-bound chronological style of maintaining a site that also pressures one to produce and publish. Alas, I didn't have the coding skills to create one. I just learned how to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator, but I wasn't verse in the languages of coding: HTML, CSS, or JS. Because of this, I settled to old-school blogging, parked the project, and focused on my other interests like photography.\n\nToday, I understand that what I really wanted was to combine both my notes and my blog posts into a single ecosystem where my writings are treated as different stages in a plant's life: [[Seeds]], [[Seedlings]], and [[Evergreens]]. This, I later learned, was connected to the idea of digital gardening.\n\nI couldn't implement this system early this year because, aside from my mediocre coding know-how, my notes and blog posts were in a form that cannot be uploaded into a static site. This was the reason why I switched from [Craft](https://www.craft.do/) to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) in curating my notes. All my notes and blog posts are now in markdown, a file type that could be uploade into the web via a static site generator like Hugo. Using a really amazing theme, [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), that is what I did.\n\nToday, I publish my Obsidian vault, with both my blog posts and notes, into a single site: [vinceimbat.com](https://vinceimbat.com/). Things aren't perfect. I am still using a theme. I still don't know how to fully customize it to suite my own needs. But I am happy with how the website turned out for now.\n\nIf you want to know more about this project, I documented it through a log here: [[Project log - Forest garden publishing]]. Also, here is a note introducing my initial thoughts about using a \"forest garden\" as a metaphor to refer to my writing and thinking ecosystem: [[thoughts/forest garden of the mind]].\n\n![Umbrellas outside](/uman/images/008/umbrellas_outside.jpg)",

It used to be a separate newsletter. But I've integrated it into [[tlw|The Long Walk]].\n\n---\n\n![Girls in uniform](/uman/images/019/girls-in-uniform.jpg)\n\nA walk on the afternoon of [[daily notes/2023-07-12|July 12]] made me realize that [[thoughts/my morning writing practice|my morning writing practice]] was too important to exchange for some time to make money in the morning. This realization led me to review my writing life in general, including my systems and routines and evaluate them against my creative goals. I wanted to check whether my current writing practice is leading me towards my goals. The result was a better articulation of [[thoughts/my poetics|my poetics]]. While going through this process I remembered that what I truly wanted to write is [[thoughts/lyrical philosophy|lyrical philosophy]]—words that combine the beauty of the poem and the depth of philosophical inquiry. Thus, I articulated [[thoughts/how to practice and write lyrical philosophy|how to practice and write lyrical philosophy]].\n\nSo, this July, I got some more writing done. While making significant progress in the current website design and development projects I am doing for two clients, both of which are ready to launch, I was also able to produce some work.\n\nSome of my favorite writings this month include the walk poem drafts:\n- [[poems/walk poem 1|Walk Poem 1]]\n- [[poems/walk poem 2|Walk Poem 2]]\n\nI wrote these poems initially as fragments of observations during two afternoon walks. My rule was to write a brief note on whatever piqued my interest or whatever thought calls on the walk and to separate lines per street where they occurred. Thus the number of stanzas equal the number of streets walked.\n\nOne Sunday morning, another poem came to me: [[poems/those stairs at bakakeng|Those Stairs at Bakakeng]].\n\nAside from these, I enjoyed writing these notes:\n- [[thoughts/suicide|suicide]]\n- [[thoughts/some experiences resist articulation|some experiences resist articulation]]\n- [[thoughts/public life is necessary|public life is necessary]]\n\nLastly, I added my essay [[essays/a never-ending walk|A Never-ending Walk]] in [[thoughts/my forest garden of the mind|my forest garden of the mind]] and shared it in the [[newsletter]].\n\nThe best books I read this month were:\n- [[thoughts/isang taong maghapon by paolo tiausas|Isang Taong Maghapon by Paolo Tiausas]]\n- [[thoughts/inahan sa sugilanon by louise far|Inahan sa Sugilanon by Louise Far]]\n\nI also re-read [[thoughts/the collapse of what separates us by vincenz serrano|The Collapse of What Separates Us by Vincenz Serrano]] to study the poems closely. I'll be sharing my notes on the site soon.\n\nAn essay I really loved reading this month was [[thoughts/melt the snowflake at once by david rothenberg|Melt the Snowflake at Once! by David Rothenberg]].\n\nHow about you? How was your July?",

However, there cannot be an infinite cause of things that are moving. At some point, there has to be an ultimate cause.\n\nThis ultimate cause of motion shouldn't be moved. Otherwise, it was also caused by something else. It isn't made of physical matter. Otherwise, it will change and, therefore, move. It also necessarily lacks [[Potentiality]]. Therefore, it is simply [[Actuality]].\n\nThe implications of the existence of an unmoved mover is profound. First, it simply means I did not come in this life by my own accord ([[We did not choose to exist]]). I was brought here by someone or something that is way more powerful than myself. And the nature of this thing or person is filled with mystery. The answers about its nature are not intuitive. They have to be pondered about. But answers don't have to be clear or final. The awe that the mystery produces is enough to move us to embrace [[thoughts/intentional living]] (i.e., appreciate everything and every moment we are alive and let that appreciation guide us to do the most important action).\n\n# References\n\n_Aristotle—The unmoved mover | Britannica_. (n.d.). Britannica.

It must, therefore, be pure actuality (_energeia_).\n\u003e\n\u003eSuch a mover could not act as an efficient cause, because that would involve a change in itself, but it can act as a final cause.\n\u003e\n\u003eAristotle is prepared to call the unmoved mover “God.”",
